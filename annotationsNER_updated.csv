,"came across this place on yelp and saw it had many reviews and the name was pretty cute so we decided to come for dinner. our friend said this place was good but quite pricey but we still wanted to give it a try. there were plenty of seating outside and inside. so we chose to sit inside. we decided to order the roasted bone marrow , cavatelli pasta , milk braised pork shoulder , and selection of the brigante al tartufo cheese platter . the roasted bone marrow was probably the best dish that we ordered. it was recommended by our friend and definitely enjoyed it. it came with some baguettes and arugula. the pasta was probably the most unexpected dish. it was basically ravioli wrapped with a goat cheese filling. the goat cheese was overpowering and extremely creamy. it was definitely one of the worst dish that we had. the pork shoulder also took forever to come out. we were done with our dishes and the pork shoulder was still not out yet. the pork was alright. it was a bit dried but paired with the mashed potatoes, it was manageable. lastly, the cheese platter was great! the cheese was light and refreshing. it came with some cracker bites and jelly. the combination was to die for! overall, i would recommend the bone marrow and the cheese platter. the pasta was the worst dish we had. and the pork shoulder was just alright. we were looking forward to our experience here and it just did not meet our expectations. our waiter also was not very nice. he seemed too cool to answer our questions and seemed to smirk a lot when taking our order.","[(313, 332, 'FOOD'), (335, 350, 'FOOD'), (353, 379, 'FOOD'), (403, 437, 'FOOD'), (444, 463, 'FOOD'), (586, 595, 'FOOD'), (600, 607, 'FOOD'), (613, 618, 'FOOD'), (675, 682, 'FOOD'), (698, 709, 'FOOD'), (723, 734, 'FOOD'), (831, 844, 'FOOD'), (913, 926, 'FOOD'), (954, 958, 'FOOD'), (1011, 1026, 'FOOD'), (1059, 1073, 'FOOD'), (1089, 1095, 'FOOD'), (1140, 1153, 'FOOD'), (1158, 1163, 'FOOD'), (1228, 1239, 'FOOD'), (1248, 1262, 'FOOD'), (1268, 1273, 'FOOD'), (1309, 1322, 'FOOD')]"
,"i've been to the met twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner. it was very, very good. between the two times i've been there i've tried the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers, dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes, prime teriyaki tenderloin bites, blackened prime rib , and filet mignon. both the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers and prime teriyaki tenderloin bites were incredibly good, very tender, and packed full of flavor. the bacon was crispy and fatty and added really nice flavor to the steak. it was borderline too much of a good thing, but i'm not complaining. the teriyaki sauce on medallions had a nice sweet and saltiness - teriyakisteak is one of my favorite meat combos and this is up there with the best of that pairing i've had. the crab cakes are really good. you get a lot of grab and a nice mix of large chunks of crab and thinner pieces. there is good moisture on the inside and a nice crispiness on the outside. it is really good by itself, with a little lemon or the slaw and sweet sauce. definitely check out if you like crab cakes. the filet mignon was unnecessarily tender - in a great way - i feel like you could cut through it with a butter knife. it was a perfect medium rare, had a good charcrust - great seasoning. it was probably the best filet that i've tried. really good. the blackened prime rib - not my favorite. the meat was very tender, it was cooked perfectly, but i found the seasoning to be just too overpowering. the salt content on the rub was a little too much for what i like - and i usually season my steaks very well. the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, bu tender but the crust kept me from loving it. good flavor, just too much of it and a little too heavy-handed with the salt. i probably would not order this specific style of prime rib again. beyond the food - the service was great. the servers are really friendly. the bar staff has some pretty good stories. what is really cool about the met is it is history. while daniel's has a great view of south lake union which i love, when you walk into the met you immediately feel like you have teleported to an old-school steakhouse because you have and you see the rich history on the walls with all the celebrities who have eaten there. daniel's has something similar, but it is not nearly as expansive as the met. food aside, it is awesome experience to eat there because of the history alone. if you have the money, want to spend it and want steak - go here. i feel like it is at the top of the pyramid for just-try steakhouses in seattle. it is the perfect combination of great food and rich history.","[(147, 179, 'FOOD'), (181, 216, 'FOOD'), (218, 249, 'FOOD'), (251, 270, 'FOOD'), (277, 289, 'FOOD'), (300, 332, 'FOOD'), (337, 368, 'FOOD'), (435, 440, 'FOOD'), (498, 503, 'FOOD'), (578, 592, 'FOOD'), (640, 653, 'FOOD'), (676, 680, 'FOOD'), (753, 763, 'FOOD'), (837, 841, 'FOOD'), (980, 985, 'FOOD'), (993, 997, 'FOOD'), (1048, 1058, 'FOOD'), (1064, 1076, 'FOOD'), (1314, 1333, 'FOOD'), (1357, 1361, 'FOOD'), (1551, 1556, 'FOOD'), (1573, 1577, 'FOOD'), (1785, 1794, 'FOOD'), (2452, 2457, 'FOOD')]"
,throwback to vacay time in chicago when i had a ball at this famous tapas bar! they say food must please all your senses! and these delicacies sure did! we started off with this lovely rose sangria paired with fried deviled eggs served with arugula and caper berries! followed by striped bass with fig wrapped in pasta and served with a drizzling of the freshest olive oil i have ever tasted! the highlight of the dinner was definitely the turkey leg confit served with crispy lentils and potatoes the meat was outstandingly tender and juicy! we had the caramel panna cotta for dessert which was a disappointment compared to the main course. tapas bars have become my thing lately and these pictures should tell you why do try out this place if you end up visiting chicago! ezeechef ezeetraveltimes chicago restaurantreview,"[(185, 197, 'FOOD'), (210, 228, 'FOOD'), (241, 248, 'FOOD'), (253, 266, 'FOOD'), (280, 301, 'FOOD'), (313, 318, 'FOOD'), (363, 372, 'FOOD'), (440, 457, 'FOOD'), (470, 484, 'FOOD'), (489, 497, 'FOOD'), (554, 573, 'FOOD')]"

,"girl in the goat was highly anticipated dinner that we planned three weeks in advance. i recommend making reservations as early as possible, the earliest we could get in was pm. it was still buzzing when we got there. sidenote the food scene in chicago was nothing less than amazing and girl and the goat blew our mind. we wanted to try as many dishes as possible so we went all out and splurged. starting with the ratatouille focaccia with baba ganoush and squash tzatziki looking back now we probably did not need the bread but it was warm and delicious in the dipping sauce. we had the sauted green beans which were rich in flavor. the confit goats belly melted in our mouths with the bourbon butter and lobster and crab, this was a favorite! the pork shank was my husbands favorite and one of the most substantial of the plates. of course we had to try the wood oven roasted pig face and this was my favorite. another melt in your mouth dish and the sunny side egg on top, yoke dripping over pork just sent my taste buds over the edge. we also had a seasonal dish of calamari that was great. we had a great experience there. it was already after midnight when we were finishing up but the wait staff was still actively bringing out food. our waiter was so good at explaining each dish that came out as well as the ingredients that were used. we could see the chefs through the open kitchen concept which i really enjoyed. if i was to go back to chicago, handsdown i would return to girl & the goat . if i am being honest, i would say it is a selling point for a trip alone.","[(415, 435, 'FOOD'), (441, 453, 'FOOD'), (458, 473, 'FOOD'), (520, 525, 'FOOD'), (563, 576, 'FOOD'), (589, 607, 'FOOD'), (639, 657, 'FOOD'), (688, 702, 'FOOD'), (707, 714, 'FOOD'), (719, 723, 'FOOD'), (750, 760, 'FOOD'), (861, 887, 'FOOD'), (954, 968, 'FOOD'), (977, 981, 'FOOD'), (996, 1000, 'FOOD'), (1071, 1079, 'FOOD')]"
