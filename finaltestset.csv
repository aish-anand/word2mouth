"sooo celebrating a year and a half anniversary yes, we are one of those couples. the boothang brought me here because he knew that i've been craving prime rib for months since house of prime rib been there done that a went for my birthday but ran out of prime rib .so i guess the next place to try was harris' after we were seated and got our menus, we were served some warm, crunchy bread slices with butter and a dipping sauce sorry i forgot what it was . after we ordered our food, we got the delicious, fresh, hot, awesome, big bread. it was some really good bread. trust. soup of the day it was lobster bisque so we had to get it. the portion was pretty big, to our surprise. worth it. i'm not going to lie, i was about half way full by the time i was done with this. it was pretty decent, but leaned towards the light side, flavorwise. i was expecting boom, lobster in every scoop, but it was more of a subtle tap on the tongue. my descriptions are not making sense anymore huh lol sorry mr.boothang did say that it did not taste like maine lobster though. apparently it was very similar to the lobster he had in santorini. roast prime rib regular cut oz , executive cut on the bone oz comes with creamed spinach and your choice of baked potato or the evening's potato, which was mashed potato for us. i did not feel like being a fatty that night, so i opted for the regular cut, and my boyfriend got the executive. if you are not extremely hungry, having been starved for a few days, then just stick with the regular cut. when the executive was placed on the table, our eyes popped. i thought to myself heh, what can i do with a boyfriend suffering from food coma a steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me b steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me or. c steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me. but jokes aside, the prime rib was pretty good. we both got it prepared rare, but it is more of a medium rare in my opinion, if it even matters to you. the meat was slightly tough, just a little bit. served with au jus, every bite was pretty good. i think the house of prime rib still has the best prime rib, and it is cheaper, but my boyfriend likes the prime rib at harris' more. is this a sign in our relationship, perhaps haha jk the two sides were great! the creamed spinach was very tasty mm mm mm. the mashed potatoes were not anything special, but the one thing that stood out was its smoothness. like a baby's bottom. we were way too full after our main course so we did not order any desserts. we only managed to finish half of our food. but hey, that means prime rib for lunch the next day d","[(149, 158, 'FOOD'), (185, 194, 'FOOD'), (254, 263, 'FOOD'), (384, 408, 'FOOD'), (532, 537, 'FOOD'), (563, 568, 'FOOD'), (577, 581, 'FOOD'), (600, 614, 'FOOD'), (864, 871, 'FOOD'), (1047, 1054, 'FOOD'), (1101, 1108, 'FOOD'), (1136, 1145, 'FOOD'), (1203, 1218, 'FOOD'), (1238, 1250, 'FOOD'), (1286, 1299, 'FOOD'), (1904, 1913, 'FOOD'), (2095, 2101, 'FOOD'), (2152, 2161, 'FOOD'), (2181, 2190, 'FOOD'), (2238, 2247, 'FOOD'), (2347, 2362, 'FOOD'), (2392, 2407, 'FOOD'), (2651, 2660, 'FOOD')]"
