0,,Alex K.,1118,3.0,10/30/2018,"this dosa location has a very romantic, upscale feel to it that is perfect for date night. unfortunately, i do not find their food to reflect the upscale vibe or price tag associated with it. we appreciated their listing of allergens on the menu but still felt a bit disappointed that only one curry larger entree could be made vegan. we ordered vegan chutney sampler . the variety of five chutneys was good, but i did not find them alone to be worth the price. vegan channa bhatura curry the highlight of the meal, this curry was nuanced, fresh and delicious. it was small for , though. vegan mixed chile uttapam super spicy, and my girlfriend and i can almost always handle the kick. the menu did say spicy! but i think this warranted a bit more warning than that. regardless, this was tasty, but i did not think it was worth . and i know, i'm getting repetitive. the soup that accompanied the uttapam was, however, super delicious. overall, my girlfriend and i enjoyed our meal but the warm ambiance and friendliness of our server could not make up for the seemingly unwarranted cost of our dinner. i do not think i will find myself returning, since we left a bit unsatisfied and ultimately, still hungry."
1,,Alison W.,1118,4.0,10/11/2018,"i would never had south indian cuisine or dosas before. but some indian friends recommended this place and i'm always up for trying something new. we had kinda a large group so we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. though we sat around for about minutes after we arrived, while they were setting up our table. we got a bunch of appetizers samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. the idli fries are bomb. they were like right out of the fryer hot. not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. and it comes with a unique dipping sauce. the chutney sampler came with chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive and complementary papad kinda like indian chips . i could have just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you cannot have just one. samosas were ok nothing out of the ordinary. then the rest of us got some kind of dosa. i actually tried the uttapam sampler. uttapam is like a thicker dosa. i could not tell you all the different types of the uttapam but i enjoyed all five of them. all were vegetarian though and some had cheese that i remember. i also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa. the dosa itself is huge and crepelike and i like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce. i think i also got to try the bhatura, which is like the puffed crepe or flat bread. i think i liked it more than the paper dos, bc it had a bit more of a sweet flavor. everything i had was really good and thanks to our friends for showing this type of cuisine. i will definitely need to search out more southern indian cuisines."
2,,Avantika A.,1118,5.0,10/8/2018,"loved the chilli uttapam ! as someone who hails from south india, i can say that this place is legit"
3,,Ramya R.,1118,3.0,9/27/2018,"this restaurant has a beautiful ambience but the food is just above average,nothing really extraordinarybeing a south indian i can cook the same food. the dishes are quite expensive and portion size is less for the price. we had masala chai,chille masala dosa,five moon uttapam and idly fry,which was all included. service was quick and servers were friendly."
4,,N N.,1118,3.0,9/25/2018,"tried this place for lunch last weekend. had heard so much about this place, so finally decided to give it a try. this place has great ambience, but sadly, the food did not live up to the hype. being a south indian myself, i was really excited about this place. we ordered the pani puri shots for appetizers, and we got puris with pani served in shot glasses. the puri tasted fresh and crispy, however we felt it was over priced for just puri's . it is also quite rare that you find only puri's per serving of pani puri. for the main course, i ordered a chicken thalli and my husband ordered the rava dosa. the rava dosa was good. it was with good serving of sambar, which i was happy with, although nothing extraordinary. the chicken thalli came with small servings of salads , chk fry, chk curry, channa, sambar, rasam, raita, curd, uttapam , lemon rice and white rice. all of which were average. nothing bad, but would not really go back. we live in san jose and there are numerous options for great south indian food for th the price. so if you are one of them, do not waste your time."
5,,Sujit D.,1118,4.0,8/13/2018,"although the name of the restaurant suggests focus on south indian cuisine, this classy joint serves variety of fusion snacks and meals east meets west. we enjoyed kerala chicken, south indian moons baby uttapams , dahi wada, south indian monsoon a non alchoholic cocktail drink, mango lassi and masala dosa all very good. staff are very friendly. service is fast for standard items masala dosa but makes you wait for nonstandard ones e.g. south indian moons . on a saturday afternoon there was no wait time to be seated for lunch. although, when visiting this place for dinner we did experience minutes wait times on weekends. the ambience is nice spacious airy and colorful. the tables are placed too close to each other for comfort. overall a nice place."
6,,Andrew S.,1118,4.0,8/4/2018,"this is the iconic south indian restaurant in san francisco. a group of us had a fantastic dinner experience here one saturday night. we shared a bunch of plates lamb dosa, rava masala, uttapams , chicken curry, goat belly and tapioca kheer. everyone had a nice cup of chai with dinner as well. the goat belly honey and pepper roasted was definitely the best part of the meal. it was a real treat and we got the last order that night. other items were also quite good i would reorder that chicken curry and lamb dosa any day. the ambiance inside the restaurant is nice. i particularly liked the high ceilings and the abundance of natural light. service was really good and the food came out really fast. relatively inexpensive for a fine dining experience including tax and tip, this was about per person. highly recommend this place for those looking for an indian feast. definitely more fun with a group."
7,,Mithun D.,1118,5.0,7/27/2018,"i took my wife on a surprise date. glad i did.we had lamb shack along with uttapam . lamb shack was delicious. uttapam and different variety of chutnies all were mouth watering. we also had pomegranate juice and mixed fruit drink with ginger, mango, pomegranate.we had mini laddu desert. all orders were delicious.please make prior reservations which i did. the place is pretty packed."
8,,Zachary F.,1118,5.0,7/9/2018,"great food, awesome ambience, reasonable pricing, we had the uttapam moons as a starter the homemade fruit fruit shrubs were amazing. this is an absolute favorite to share with friends."
9,,garbanzo b.,1118,4.0,6/11/2018,"good food, great ambience, reasonable pricing we had the uttapam moons as a starter to get our appetite wet for the true star of the show the masala dosa!"
10,,Chintan D.,1118,4.0,5/29/2018,very nice place and ambience for an indian restaurant. the dosas and uttapam were amazing. vada pav was best in bay area.
11,,Cat T.,1118,3.0,5/19/2018,"overhyped type of place. coming to visit sf to see friends in town. two friends that live their mentioned dosa to me. the food did not have very distinct flavors. i felt like the dosa, uttampams and the curry all generally taste the same. we order the paneer & peas dosa, roasted chile & garlic dosa, brokaw avocado chaat, philipkutty chicken curry, and the south indian moons different uttapams . out of everything, i would say the curry was maybe the best thing but that was pretty typical but at least the chicken was tender. the overall restaurant is very nice and fancy but food was subpar. recommend to try just once. best to get reservation on weekend nights."
12,,Dhaval M.,1118,5.0,5/16/2018,awesome place with superb ambience! it provides a fine dine experience and suitable for dinner dates and celebrations. the food presentation is great. they have customized lot of indian dishes in a unique way to present it well but keeping the authenticity of the taste. i've tried few dishes and all of them from dosas to uttapam turned out great. of course it is a bit expensive but that is what you pay for such an ambience in sf. the servers are very kind. not recommended to walkin without reservation.
13,,Abhishek C.,1118,1.0,5/14/2018,"visited the dosa with family as it came with a glowing recommendation and a rating on yelp. but boy, were we in for a rude shock! landing at the place with a prior reservation, we were welcomed by a big heavy door and a sizeable eating joint designed at two levels. little did i realise that it was the only big thing that we were going to be experiencing in the restaurant that night besides the final cheque of course which was already expected we immediately realised after talking to the hostess that they had forgotten to reserve a table for us yelp . they tried to turn it around with a tiny corner table on the upper level which could have seated kids maybe! after a few minutes of contemplation, maybe the staff realised we were definitely not going to sit in each other's laps and the guests on the adjacent table sportingly moved to make more space for us. the real horror started then with our server for the day, brittany c. now when a restaurant decides to charge you a % service markup automatically just because you are group of or more, the least that you expect is a decent service! but brittany came in with a tiny heart and grumpy attitude and seemed more in a mood as if we were there to eat for free! after a very offending introduction to a set menu or the preferable ala carte menu , we placed our orders without any recommendations being offered by her despite telling that it was our first visit. we ordered the rava dosa, egg dosa, chile uttapam and goat biryani along with a rasam the complimentary pappadums never came out even though the meal came pretty quickly. we had to explicitly ask for them before they turned up. now the dosa and uttapam were served with a moderate sized bowl of sambhar and tiny portions of chutneys. anyway knowing anything about south indian food may please enlighten me how to eat a dosa with a few spoons of sambhar and a teas oonful of chutney the food was served very rudely and when we asked if we could get more chutney, we got a condescending answer of it will cost you . when we have our consent another server brought it out and it was shockingly just another teaspoonful! we asked the new server if this is what we get in , he got confused and said he will be right back after checking but it never happened! now in this entire episode the food is not anything great to write about. it is not bad but it is definitely not worth a for someone who knows how south indian tastes like. the goat biryani is definitely not a recommendation at all!! coming back to the service, we never got any water refills and noone checked on how we were liking the food. at the end of it we left most of the goat biryani but brittany just brought out the cheque and did not even care to ask why the biryani was left over. for the biryani we asked for a take away box thought we could give it to someone needy but brittany just brought the box and placed it rudely in front of us without a word or smile after all this, we decided that the service did not deserve a % charge and we called in the manager who came in with a fake smile and concern. the manager heard our entire ordeal and said she will fix the bill and offered free desserts. we told her very clearly we did not want free stuff but also did not want to pay for a service we did not get and just wanted the charge removed. but she insisted that as it was mother's day she would want us to have desserts so we agreed. and then she crumpled the old bill right in front of us, do not know if that was really required to be done! in comes brittany with the dessert oh the horror!! . she placed one dessert in front of us rudely she could have dropped it on our head if she could have had her way and made a statement you talked to my manager, your bill will come in soon and just walked away. and then she comes back with another one and leaves with a statement hope the free desserts make up for your concerns . hello why the hell do people think that customers complain to get free stuff oh and she did come in again to offer chai or coffee which she said was on her. well dear brittany, after the experience i would not even had water if it was on you coming from india, i always thought america offers a different standard of service to customers. but dear dosa management, believe me i realise now that tiny hearts and money minded businesses are incapable of offering anything more than a product. please keep your free stuff to yourself, if you can offer anything do offer some warmth in your cold little place! to mr anjan thanks for your revert but it just reaffirms your attitude towards the whole incident! we are not looking for your free stuff so please keep the offer to yourself. would have been happier to see your revert say we would offer impeccable and warm service!"
14,,Clare L.,1118,3.0,5/5/2018,"my boyfriend and i think this place was alright. it is more like an indian fusion restaurant than an authentic southern indian place. if we ever crave for dosa again, we probably will go somewhere else. on the day of our visit, the majority of the dishes offered on the menu were vegetarian. though the restaurant was not full, we waited for a long time before the staff came to take our order. for the dosa, we ordered the classic masala dosa . there were three complementary sauces and they were all pretty decent. they were more on the sour side. the dosa came really fast and the crepe itself was thin and crisp. pretty good. we also ordered mixed mushroom uttapam . this dish was really meh. it felt like a simple pizza on an indian dough. uttapam was kinda sour and there was quite a lot of cheese on the dish. the complementary sauces were the same as the dosa's. the dish was fairly bland and also soggy. we could not manage to finish this. our last dish was the goat dum biryani. this was probably our favorite dish out of the three we ordered. the goat biryani was sitting inside a naanbread like bowl and there was a yogurtlike complementary sauce. the biryani was well flavored and decently spicy. we really loved the goat super juicy, soft and wellseasoned. it is a decent indian restaurant but with how much it is charging you, i probably will not revisit again."
15,,Shireen K.,1118,3.0,4/24/2018,"the masala dosa was tasty however there was a very small portion of the actual potatoes in the center. we also ordered the chefs choice uttapam which did not give us a bang for our buck, the five pieces were tiny and basically served as one biters almost. if i had to reorder i would go with a regular uttapam rather than a traditional dosa or the chefs choice. the raita we ordered on the side was as expected but again the portion was rd the serving bowl. in summary the food was average good but the portions were very small giving the impression of corners being cut."
16,,Tiffany H.,1118,4.0,3/14/2018,"yums! i really enjoyed the masala dosa dish i ordered, but i think the food here is quite pricey. i've been told by my brown companion that dosa is overpriced and overhyped and to not go here , but i still had to give it a try. the potato was quite creamy, and the dosa was light and crispy. i liked the sauces to dip the dosa in it was not super spicy for me, but it can be, especially if you are not used to the heat. the sambar lentil and vegetable dipping soup was good as well. i tried a bite of my friend's uttapam south indian moons featuring different types of uttapam , and while it was good, it was not utterly amazing. the service here is very friendly, as one would expect for a restaurant of this quality. the meal overall was not too heavy, and i liked the fact that i felt pretty light and clean afterwards."
17,,Adrienne K.,1118,5.0,3/2/2018,"really good indian food in the fillmore. this is southern indian cuisine, so not what we are used to in the states no tandoor, no naan . with that being said, the breads are absolutely delicious, as are the various toppings, fillings, and curries. would highly recommend the butternut squash and paneer uttapam and the vegan curry that comes with the poori. service was efficient and friendly. cocktails looked interesting, but i did not partake."
18,,Angela C.,1118,4.0,3/1/2018,"when you mention that you are going to dosa and someone asks you to order takeout for lunch the next day, you know you are going somewhere good. that was the prehype i experienced about dosa, when me and my friend announced our intent to grab a late night dinner there. was the guy who said that right about just how good the food was eh. it was good, but not something i would look forward to eating day old like him. we snuck into the restaurant right before closing. still, our waiter was very courteous even though we stayed past official hours. the decor of the restaurant is classy and is definitely a hip, upscale place. for food, i opted to try the south indian moons the chef's selection of five different uttapams . i really appreciate when a restaurant has the option to sample different dishes! they were all pretty good, but i think my main issue was that i could not tell them apart. maybe i should have gotten a dosa after all, that is the name of the restaurant. i think for the price and experience i'm willing to come back and try it again. the service and ambiance impressive, i hope next time to find a dish i fall in love with."
19,,Ro C.,1118,4.0,2/19/2018,"been here a few times. dosa always good. coconut chutney could be better but the other accompaniments are good. spicy uttapam good, no joke on the spice, highest tolerance needed. spicy avocado chaat meh. it is basically just avocado in some watery spice mixture, with an odd mix of grapefruit pieces on top and very minimal crispy shavings. nothing like a traditional chaat if that is what you are thinking. vada pav good, some zest. mint lemonade good. ambiance good. seem to usually be busy even at notbusy hours, or at least they say they cannot open a table at even though you can see empty tables."
20,,David Y.,1118,4.0,3/5/2018,"most of the dishes we ordered at dosa were quite good. really enjoyed the dosa and the idly fries, which were full of so many diverse flavors. the paper dosa was awesome i.e. literally, aweinducing due to the portion size . as soon as it was served, i realized we had ordered simply too much food. the paper dosa could probably feed a party of four comfortably. after the dosa, our entrees came the prawn masala and duck . i was not a big fan of the duck dish but the prawn masala was explosive in flavors. great location with a beautiful interior, would definitely come back to try out some of the other items on the menu!"
21,,Sebastian F.,1118,4.0,2/26/2018,"i live in the neighborhood for a few years now and cannot believe i have not been to dosa! upscale indian food in a super vibrant setting rezzies highly recommended, and be prepared to pay more than the usual sf prices for your food. what you get in return however is amazing great presentation, fast and friendly service, and boozy drinks from the bar. i was impressed with the lamb kema dosa a rice and lentil crepe with spiced minced lamb , less impressed with the chutney sampler . , pretty small , but then again impressed with the prawn masala . love the atmosphere and the food, and the prices. oh well."
22,,Jennifer M.,1118,4.0,2/8/2018,pricey for elevated indian food but really good. i'm coming back again for sure. for a teeny bit of brussel sprouts tastes good but not worth getting that. avoid though they recommend. paper dosa yuuuuuuuuuge. very good. liked the masala dosa dipped in a mix of the warm sambar sauce with the spicy tomato chutney. did not like the spicy green coconut chutney. prawn masala grilled over a bed of firm coconut rice surrounded by coconut tomato curry. had a nice bit of spiciness. i do not like coconut curries but i loved this. came with largeish deshelled but tailon shrimp. cocktails interesting flavors and tasty but very light on alcohol for being +
23,,Kim B.,1118,1.0,12/18/2017,"honestly, this used to be my absolute favorite restaurant for years in san francisco. i moved away to co about two years ago, and came back recently to dine there, and it was the worst indian food i've ever had. i asked the waitress why everything was so different, and she said they recently had some menu changes. i could not be more depressed about this. i ordered the idli fries as an appetizer, which were unimpressive and the prawn masala as my entree. the curry to the prawn masala tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry. my mom ordered a chicken curry, which also had a watery consistency, and no flavor. this is one of the pricier indian restaurants, and i had always felt it was worth it perviously, but if you are thinking of going there now, i would advise you to save your money."
24,,Dan W.,1118,4.0,12/11/2017,"dosa delivers big flavors and great textures. the dosa itself is worth coming back for. highlights dosa masala prawn masala kerala fried chicken also tried the dahi vada while good and creamy, there was so much lemon juice it was borderline offensive."
25,,A K.,1118,5.0,11/12/2017,"worth the hype and the money! excellent service, and very good selection in the menu. cannot go wrong with anything. do try the lamb keema dosa, the fried chicken and the prawn masala . parking may be a hassle, but hey this is sf!"
26,,Aaron B.,1118,5.0,8/17/2017,"dosa on fillmore is pretty rad. the space is huge which is always a treat in sf. we made a reservation on yelp and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. they have a really great cocktail selection and looks like they regularly rotate out new drinks. i forget what i had but it was spicy and unique. my first thought was what is a dosa they are basically giant indian tacos but a little more sophisticated. first off, they are huge. they are veggies and meat wrapped in delicious bread. we got one or two as an app and it was great. we got some other apps as well but the must have one is the giant puffy bread. it is literally fried dough the size of a basketball and filled with air. it tasted great and was fun to eat. for the main dish i got the prawn masala . i love all things coconut milk and seafood. it was exactly what i wanted. you do not get a ton of food here like most indian place. for it was perfect for one person but i did not have any leftovers. this was my first upscale indian experience and i loved it."
27,,Chloe M.,1118,4.0,2/28/2017,"another great neighborhood goto! i have never made a reservation at dosa, but am thinking we should start. every time we have gone, we have gone at prime dinner time pm pm and have seen a long wait. every time, we have miraculously found a spot at the bar or been seated at a table in record time. lucky, i guess! i am not a huge fan of eating at the bar here, as it is busy and noisy. i'm paying the same for the meal, i would prefer the full experience. sitting at a table is lovely and service at both table and bar is top notch. now for the food boyfriend always gets a dosa and loves them! i've been a fan of dosas, but for whatever reason i do not dig dosa's dosas. so i've experimented. one time, i got a mango salad with some sea tuber that was inedible it was so salty. another time, i got scallops eh . once, i just ordered bread. last time, i got the prawn masala which was great. i finally found my dish. one thing never changes i always order the bhatura. oh. my. sweet. jesus. i love this bread so much. when it comes out, it is a huge puff the size of your head. everyone stares. worth it. it is like low key fried dough. i could eat that bread every day and do every time we go to dosa . huge highlight even when my main dish is not to die for. overall, love this place. great upscale ambiance, great place to bring visitors. again, would recommend a reservation. also, without fail, we are always surprised by the bill. both food and drink are a little spendy for weeknight indian, but we keep coming back!"
28,,Claudia M.,1118,4.0,1/29/2017,"one of the best dining experiences i've had! took advantage of the restaurant week deal. starters, dosas or curries, and deserts. the flavors were superb and the service was good. ambiance feels a bit upscale yet still causal. serving sizes are on the small side but the taste of everything i tried made up for it all. i will definitely be back. here's what we ordered starters beet croquettes chennai chicken lemon chile scallops dosas lamb keema dosa mixed mushroom & truffle oil uttapam goan prawn masala w rice deserts rasmalai pistachio barfi i was not a fan of the deserts much but that is mostly because i do not have much of a sweet tooth. my sister did enjoy them though! i would eat everything again. cannot wait to try more of their menu."
29,,Liz C.,1118,5.0,1/27/2017,"i had been meaning to make it to dosa for a while now i finally paid a visit on a friday evening during sf's restaurant week. when you walk in, you notice how beautiful the space is. the whole ambiance of the place is indeed trendy, as yelp would put it. not an authentically indian vibe, but still very appealing. a little too dimly lit for me, perhaps also an oddly desirable music playlist indie electronic hits either way, seemed like a great place to be for dinner and drinks at the end of welldeserved week. my party of decided to go for the prix fix menu featured as part of their restaurant week menu, but also something that they offer on the regular . each plate was phenomenal and mindfully prepared. some standouts for me were the sprouted mung and paneer salad, goan prawn masala , and the classic masala dosa the chef was also nice enough to give us an additional sweet potato dosa to accommodate the of us . the curries were spicy even for me, but i love me a good spicy dish so no complaints from me although that could be an area of concern for many others. service was okay, found my server to be somewhat aloof and a little confused as well, but you cannot have it all, right "
30,,Edna C.,1118,4.0,1/26/2017,"a fancy indian place in japantown given sf's trends of overpriced food, i was a skeptic but got lured by restaurant week, when i found dosa to be the only place with a worthwhile menu. while most other restaurants feature the anticlimatic addition of a salad and a brownie for a course meal, dosa became an adventurous feast through spices and creative cooking. small plates] ++ chips you start off with complimentary chips, and it is unlike anything i've ever eaten before. it is light, crispy, and has a handful of seeds thrown in. ++ chennai chicken the expertly roasted chicken maintains a savory juiciness while imparting strong smokey tones, contrasting boldly with the cool cucumber and yogurt sauce. ++ sprouted mung & paneer salad the varied landscape of flavors was noteworthy, but the texture was truly outstanding. this dish deserves some mindful eating to fully appreciate how the chewy coconut, crunchy pomegranate, and springy arugula simultaneously influence the sprouted mung bean, which ends up tasting more crispy or soft depending on what ends up in that particular forkful. the paneer is interestingly akin to tofu, and i enjoyed the pure taste in contrast to the more pungent versions i usually see. ++ beet croquettes the sophisticated take pulls off a vegetablebased, creamfree, extra creamy croquettes. not only does the blend of several vegetables create a palatable base the incorporation of spices, nuts, curry, and a cranberry chutney adds extra layers of complexity. curries etc.] +++ nagai vegetable korma i chose this somewhat as a chore so we could eat our veggies, knowing that vegetable dishes typically pales next to meat dishes even at state bird! but we even the boo who is usually carnivorous were blown away. the perfect spice blends of ageold south indian cuisine combined with novelty vegetables like marble potatoes and romanesco creates a dish that looks modest but synergistically showcases the magic of fresh produce and ethnic cooking. how californian + goan prawn masala i was unimpressed by the portion size of one shrimp per person, and that these were standardsized shrimp and not prawns . the marsala is constructed from distinctly fresh ingredients, but was dominated by the fiery spiciness. +++ roasted masala lamb shank in an era when fine dining consists of abstractly small portions, this ginormous leg of a lamb was a surprise and well worth the extra charge. the hour slow braising resulted in falloffthebone tender and had a similar pervasively roasty flavors to the chennai chicken excellent savory dish in itself, but exacerbates the spiciness of the prawn masala . the mix of spices with the vegetablebased seasoning added subtlety, and the lamb paired well with the fragrant lemon herb rice. dessert] + sweet cheese patties not sure if my expectations had just built up too high over the meal or if the dessert is too advanced for me, but despite the intrigue of rose water i think this was my least favorite. the cheese itself had a limp texture and tasted in between savory cheese and dessert, and the conglomerate of cream nut cardamom floral added to the confusion for me. + pistachio barfi as a whole it tasted like an artisan dark chocolate however it was too sugary, which overshadowed any fascinations from cashew milk and hibiscus. dranks] ++ mango lassi good mango flavor, easy to drink and not too thick. with the tagline urban south indian dining with a californian sensibility , dosa exemplifies the unique and delicious globallocal theme that takes the fusion concept to the next level. presentation is onpoint instagramworthy for the most partfrom the giant fluffy channa bhatura bread that always catches your eye as it passes by your table, to the fine diningesque display of beet croquettes on a wooden board with a magenta smear. i actually like how there is also a mix of more plain presentation, such as the vegetable korma in the traditional indian bowl, which tones down any pretentiousness. ambiance is swanky, with extremely dim lighting if good food pictures are a priority, i strongly recommend coming for a sunny brunch instead . the tall ceilings with a half second level and bar along one side reminds me of nopa. although service was friendly, i must say my main gripe overall was the slowness we arrived at and left at o.o which meant extra needed for parking they only validate ironically, the server checked in with us several times to ask if our round of apps entrees had arrived, and our answer was that none or only one had come. she also took forever on the mango lassi when boo was breathing fire from the spiciness. pro tip although the menu is extensively notated with dairy egg gluten nut free vegan, it lacks spiciness warnings. if you cannot handle spicy, i suggest avoiding anything that says curry leaves and or prophylactically getting yourself a glass of mango lassi."
31,,Nipun S.,1118,5.0,6/12/2016," stars for sure. the number of stars reviews that i write have gone down sharply since i have started writing more reviews. i try to reserve them for something special and unique. this place deserves stars for its combination of wonderful food and amazing ambience. i can nearly say that this place has the best ambience amongst the indian restaurants that i have been to in the us, till now. for people of indian origin, i would recommend this place for taking nonindian friends out to and especially if you have to take your parents or relatives out for a meal. this will definitely be a place that will leave a good impression. for everyone, this is the kind of ambience and food that i want every indian place should have. gets busy over the weekend so make a reservation. now that i have commented enough about other things let us get to the food. appetizers order the fried idllis, and chennai chicken. both are nice and good. main course being named dosa, we had to try some dosa's and they turned out to be pretty good. over two visits we have tried mung dosa, rava dosa, and paneer dosa. i liked the mung and rava dosa more than the paneer dosa. we tried some other entrees also really loved the prawn masala and the channa bhatura. if you do not want to have a dosa i would recommend either of these two. both had wonderful flavor. sweets ras malai was good. mango lassi was also good. enjoy the food and the environment."
32,,Michelle L.,1118,4.0,1/6/2016,"i was first introduced to the restaurant by the bf over a year ago. & since then i have been back numerous times. i kid you not this is his favorite restaurant! we threw his surprise th birthday dinner here because that is how much he loves dosa! i will not lie, the menu could be a little overwhelming for first timers. they give these complimentary bombbb crisps to start and they are so addictive! we have tried a bunch of their dishes but their menu is quite large. we have barely touched base on it. some of my faves are duck tacos it was too spicy for some of the lads so i had them all to myself lol chennai chicken samosas prawn masala sweet potato & white truffle masala i want to go back to dosa now after writing this review!!!"
33,,Stephanie C.,1118,4.0,12/23/2015,"a friend of mine made a reservation for a girls' night here and the ambiance definitely fit the bill! the decor and lighting make the place feel super upscale yet warm, somehow. loved that! onto the food be forewarned that if you have a palate that is slightly sensitive to spice, most of the items we ordered had a low heat that built up over the course of the meal. i personally love spicy, but i had friends who wished they would been warned about the spice on the menu beforehand. the menu was a bit overwhelming so we followed the recommendations of our waiter. would order again prawn masala the thick, flavorful yummy sauce! the prawns ! everything about this dish was just so good. a decentsized portion, too it came with large prawns yes.i counted. chennai chicken i would describe this dish as flavorful chicken tenders served with a yogurt sauce and onions. very shareable, good for a small group to split! masala dosa of course you have to order a dosa when you come to dosa! this was my first time trying one, and i loved the concept of various dipping sauces. i was underwhelmed by the south indian moons a sampler of uttapams because they all kind of tasted the same. if i were to return, i would stick with the dosas, appetizers, and entrees!"
34,,Brian P.,1118,5.0,11/22/2015,"the wait was super long on a friday night but it was worth it. we got the truffle masala dosa, frankly tacos this i would only give a . for and the prawn masala curry. the dosa and masala curry was out of this world good. wish they started this in ny!"
35,,Zareen A.,1118,2.0,5/11/2015,"last night my family and i went out to eat at dosa on fillmore to celebrate mother's day. unfortunately our time at this restaurant was a major disappointment from start to finish, and will linger in our minds as one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. prior to coming in we had made and confirmed a reservation through the dining room manager, dan, for fourteen people at seven thirty in the evening, yet when we arrived at the restaurant we were told that a reservation was made for only eight people by the host a man wearing a black hat and a goatee who had a very combative attitude and demeanor towards my uncle. we were told to wait and after some time we finally got a table for all of our party this negative incident set the tone for the rest of the evening which only got progressively worse as it went on. we started off with the chennai chicken for appetizers which had an extremely odd texture and a batter that was not particularly noteworthy and quite bland. the chicken biryani was flavorless, and did not taste at all like what a proper biryani should taste like. the prawn masala was passable however it was still very mediocre perhaps the most disappointing dish of all however, were the lamb chops which not only fell short of the proper marination but it also had a very off putting taste of raw and uncooked spices that made the dish highly unenjoyable for our palettes. the food that we ate at this restaurant was so unexceptional,forgettable and flavorless that we would never even think of considering to come back to this place. the chef if there is one needs proper training to bring out the delectable flavors that are commonly found in great indian cuisine.pseudo concoctions of spices, are not acceptable in an establishment where the prices are so lavishly expensive. we have no problem paying any amount provided that the food is in par with the prices being charged. while our waiter forest was attentive and did his job well, what we found to be even worse than the food at this restaurant was how we were treated towards the end of our meal. we completed eating our meal, but my father was still finishing his drink of gin and tonic when we were abruptly and quite rudely told to leave by the host who was a gentleman wearing a black hat and had a goatee, because apparently according to him there were too many people waiting to be seated and we were occupying space . we were absolutely flabbergasted by the way that we were treated no one should be disrupted from their dining experience and be told to leave and especially not when it was obvious that we were clearly not done and ready to go. considering the exorbitant amount of money we payed to eat here . , the host service and food that we received was not acceptable on any level. while the ambiance at this restaurant was beautiful, the subpar food combined with the disrespectful way that we were treated has left us with a very bad taste in our mouth and we will not be returning in the future. this is very typical of an absentee owner anjan mitra who is ambitious to expand his empire without any desire or passion to maintain and perfect the establishments that he already has. i highly recommend that the owner should retrain his staff and read the book setting the table by danny meyers, which is a must read for all of the staff in order to fully grasp and understand the basic and critical nuances of the hospitality industry."
36,,Angela R.,1118,4.0,5/1/2015,"i'm a fan of dosa in the mission and equally a fan of the one on fillmore. the interior space is stunning high ceilings and gorgeous artwork. i would recommend the seared scallops to start holy heck, were these good , and the prawn masala . throw in a bhatura for good measure. they have no beer on tap, but do have a decent bottled selection. also, the cocktails are fantastic. give dosa a shot for a lovely date night + movie at the kabuki!"
37,,Aletta H.,1118,5.0,3/21/2015,"paired with coconut rice, the prawn masala meets your wildest curry dreams. if you do not have those dreams, you will after dining here . the mandarin lentil salad is a fresh way to start your meal, along with glasses of light and airy pinot blanc. we sat at the bar and received menu recommendations from an bartender who looked like dwayne johnson. no complaints. the atmosphere is upscale trendy. we admired the the colorful jellyfish lights that dazzle the front area of the restaurant. the fillmore concert hall is a five minute walk from dosa, so you can enjoy a contemporary indian meal before a show."
38,,Aman B.,1118,4.0,3/11/2015,"we ordered the keema dosa, prawn masala , channa batura and the hyderabadi chicken biryani. the dosa with keema combo is spot on. prawn sauce is great with naan or other breads and the chicken biryani is solid."
39,,Pim H.,1118,5.0,3/9/2015,"i love white truffle dosa here. the prawn masala and halibut moilee are fantastic. i accidentally ate a chili pepper and the staff was super nice. she gave me the mango lasi which effectively removed the burn in my mouth. everything is fantastic here starting from location, atmosphere, restaurant decoration, food, and staff."
40,,Neil S.,1118,5.0,10/21/2018,"really enjoyed dosa on fillmore. it felt like a modern spin on indian food. the food was all delicious. had the paper masala dosa , which was great. mango lassi was really thick, maybe a little too thick, but really good. rasmalai was great. will definitely go back."
41,,Karan A.,1118,2.0,10/14/2018,"we have had three truly awful experiences at dosa after a few years of consistently decent food. this last one, today, was unfortunately strike three and we do not think we will be coming back. the food was incredibly spicy. not hot, but uncomfortably spicy and i can handle spice relatively easily. the service was aok. we ordered one appetizer and two entrees and while the appetizer was , both entrees were paper masala dosa as well as the egg curry with paratha. it is been hours since i ate this stuff and i still have heartburn. for the prices they charge, the meal was totally not worth it. i know their drinks are good, but for a cocktail is also kinda ridiculous if you want to have more than one drink. so, no thank you. we will not be coming back!"
42,,Alison W.,1118,4.0,10/11/2018,"i would never had south indian cuisine or dosas before. but some indian friends recommended this place and i'm always up for trying something new. we had kinda a large group so we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. though we sat around for about minutes after we arrived, while they were setting up our table. we got a bunch of appetizers samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. the idli fries are bomb. they were like right out of the fryer hot. not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. and it comes with a unique dipping sauce. the chutney sampler came with chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive and complementary papad kinda like indian chips . i could have just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you cannot have just one. samosas were ok nothing out of the ordinary. then the rest of us got some kind of dosa . i actually tried the uttapam sampler. uttapam is like a thicker dosa . i could not tell you all the different types of the uttapam but i enjoyed all five of them. all were vegetarian though and some had cheese that i remember. i also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa . the dosa itself is huge and crepelike and i like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce. i think i also got to try the bhatura, which is like the puffed crepe or flat bread. i think i liked it more than the paper dos, bc it had a bit more of a sweet flavor. everything i had was really good and thanks to our friends for showing this type of cuisine. i will definitely need to search out more southern indian cuisines."
43,,Craig Y.,1118,5.0,7/14/2018,"hard to find! but worth the search. when it comes to indian cuisine this place nails it. the dosa as you can imagine is a house specialty and well worth it. big enough for sharing, i recommend getting one dish per person and then sharing family style. today we tried the summer thali a sampler of about different dishes , the paper masala dosa basically potatoes and dosa , and south indian moons which were little glutenfree pancakes each highlighting a different ingredient. so much fun. food great!the taste was spicy without being overwhelming or too hot. the masala potatoes were among the best i've tried and i've tried a lot . and even though i did not do not love everything on the sampler platter i loved the chance to explore new flavors. allergyfriendly very allergyfriendly. the menu clearly marks which items are gluten, egg, dairy, and nut free. and it is good service seriously attentive people. came around often without being bothersome. filled up our water routinely without having to ask. and asked how things were going. if you are looking for good indian food in the bay near japantown come to dosa !"

45,,Harsha P.,1118,5.0,3/30/2018,accommodated us as walk ins on a busy night. was with a work colleague and they were quick to take our orders and serve us. the fried idli appetizer and the beet dahi vadas were absolutely amazing. we ordered the paper masala dosa and the paneer dosa . tons of food as we had to take some of the dinner entrees back for the next day. nice ambience and friendly service.
46,,Aditya V.,1118,4.0,11/11/2017,"overall, the food and service were great. we got the vada pav and chutney platter was a bit surprised they charged for chutney for the main course, i had a paper masala dosa and my friend had a chilli garlic dosa and they were both excellent. my dosa came out a bit cold, but they replaced it immediately and all was good. reserved via yelp reservations and the experience was seamless. a bit pricey, but hey, this is san francisco. i would recommend this place for a special occasion or a nice night out but reserve in advance as it tends to get full and you may end up having to sit at the community table."
47,,Surashree K.,1118,3.0,8/25/2017,"a couple of friends and i visited this place on a friday night with high expectations. the wait was about a half an hour we wish we would just gotten a reservation via yelp instead. the food was fine definitely not the best dosas i've had. we got the idli fries and vada pav to start with. both were v.good, the fries nice and crunchy and loaded with a tasty spice rub, the vada pav a delicious mixture of sweet and sour protip from a mumbaikar where the vada pav was invented make the vada less soggy by holding back on the imli chutney! also would have been nice if it was a tad spicy . all in all, the appetizers were a success. for mains we got the paper masala dosa and have to say, was a little disappointed, esp for a place that is named after this lovely south indian dish. the portions are on the small side by indian food standards, but i guess that is what you expect from an upscale place oh, and our server was super nice. would definitely go back again to try other items on the menu."
48,,Prarthna A.,1118,1.0,7/4/2017,"unpleasantly surprised! disclaimer this is my favorite restaurant in the city and i am regular here! made a reservation to go here for dinner tonight for july th and the service was horrible! the restaurant was busy which is understood but there was clear chaos in the service. it took the waiter a good minutes to come by the table to take the order. after we finally ordered here is sequence of events drinks ordered a glass of wine, a beer, kingfisher and a kids mango lassi. the first drinks to arrive was mango lassi came in a kids cup but no straw and the wine. asked the server about the missing beer and he said he will check and he walked away casually without acknowledging the missing straw on the cup ! hello!! how do you expect the kid to drink that will come back to the beer in a bit. asked another server passing by for a straw and he delivered one. ordered vada pav for appetizer & prawn masala , paratha and paper masala dosa for entree. the first food item to be delivered was the prawn masala which comes with rice minus the paratha. no sign of appetizer either or the beer. story of the beer after more minutes of waiting the waiter stopped by and my husband asked for the beer and his response ! we ran out of kingfisher yesterday. i am sorry i just found out, can i get you a pilsner instead my husband, ahhh ok, please do! and the beer came after another minutes of ordering that!!! phew! and then came the paratha! and another mins after that came the appetizer, vada pav. my little one then asks, mommy, where is the dosa which took them another minutes or so . gawd!!! utter and complete chaos in service today!!"
49,,Yash D.,1118,2.0,5/20/2017,"basically this place is regular mediocre food served in a fancy setting. the decor gets full marks, the food disappointing at best. just the name says dosa , but the dosa idlis are no good. the garlic and chile dosa was not any good. the idli and vada was cold and horrible. the bhutura was sweet and very oily, and tasted weird. the sambhar was not any good as well. the paper dosa and paper masala dosa was the reason i give the one star. maybe the curries are good do not visit for any dosa or idlis. management, please change the name to everything but dosas . update spoke to management about how i did not like the food and i felt the management was genuinely interested in getting my feedback, which is reassuring. maybe i will revisit."
50,,Jen B.,1118,4.0,2/22/2016,"i've been here twice now. i really love this restaurant overall. i would give it five stars for decor and service. it is gorgeous inside and they play nice music in the background. the menu has beautiful choices of traditional dishes as well as interesting fusion dishes like black truffle dosa . hmmmm! we have tried and loved the chennai chicken, vada pav, paper masala dosa , and uttapams. delicious!!!!! i cannot tell you how great those things are. the only reason they do not get five stars is their chutneys. the coconut and tomato chutneys they serve with their dosas are both not very good at all. if they changed their recipes for these dishes i would easily give this restaurant five stars."
51,,Shweta M.,1118,4.0,8/12/2014,"been to both the locations a countless times dosa fillmore & valencia but this one hands down is my favorite. what we usually order tamil lamb with malaysian paranthas spicy & yum lately for some reason, they are mostly out of their malaysian paranthas dahi rice it used to be really good but taste has gone down a bit the past two times i have ordered it. it always needs some seasoning! paneer & peas dosa my husband's all time favorite!! their paper masala dosa and chile utthapam is pretty decent as well idli sambhar super chennai chicken another yummer lamb chops little sweet for my indian taste buds vada pav mini sliders.perfect and so tasty! this was definitely a starred restaurant for us, but in my last two visits to dosa , i was a little unhappy with my dahi rice and sambhar, and hence the stars. another thing that i usually get very annoyed with is their constant menu changes, another downer for me. not a big fan of their desserts except one, so if you love mangoes, make sure you leave some room for their mango pudding, tried & tested many times!! tip weekdays or weekends, the place is always crowded, so always best to make reservations."
52,,Justin G.,1118,5.0,12/12/2013,"great spot for folks looking to get away from indian food that solely consists of chicken tikka masala . dosa's take on south indian food is great everything has so much flavor. our favorite was the paper masala dosa and duck vindaloo very spicy . we always end up ordering way too much food. only negative is that the service can be a bit slow, but that is it."
53,,The Bottomless Pi T.,1118,4.0,12/11/2013,"i love dosas , and i love dosa too! we went here for lunch, and the place was pretty empty when we arrived. we had the lamb frankie and the paper masala dosa . the lamb arrived wrapped and cut in half, perfect for sharing. that was probably my favorite part of the meal. when the dosa arrived, we stared at how big it was. we could not fit it on the table for without spilling over to the nearby table. good thing no one was sitting next to us. food was excellent. the only thing preventing stars was the price. love the high ceilings and ambiance."
54,,Shrenik D.,1118,4.0,12/3/2013,"the ambience is great for a date or family get togethers. we had to wait mins on a saturday evening even though we had a reservation. we ordered these . vada pav excellent, must haves, especially tastes awesome with the gunpowder chutney. . kaju paneer masala the paneer was tasty but the paratha was basically the 'kawan paratha' anybody who shops at indian grocery stores would know which disappointed us a bit since it was not 'home made'. . paper masala dosa the dosa and masala were regular, nothing out of the ordinary being an indian and having eaten dosas growing up ."
55,,Maria G.,1118,3.0,3/4/2013,"the food was yumm, but maybe i had expectations set up too high, and so i got a bit disappointed. it was good, but not awesome! sample of uppadam, stars. paper masala dosa , . even if it was on the big eat list , chicken curry, stars. vada pav, big eat list . desert chesecake , , good, but sooo small."

57,,Shira C.,1118,5.0,9/20/2012,"a cozy yet casual, intimate yet fun place and experience. i came with two girl friends on a monday night around and were seated immediately by the window. we stuffed ourselves and i am now a fan of dosa and am so so glad that the x list brought me here! good things so pretty much everything we ordered appetizer vada pav veggie slider okay so the name really does not do it justice, mostly because i love meat and think all sliders should be made with beef patties, but this was so flavorful and delicious. the bun is sweet and the caramelized onions provide a nice contrast to the dry but perfectly seasoned potatoes. the dish comes with gunpowder, which is this spicy chili powder that you mix with melted butter to form a chili spread. it is really fun to make haha. btw this is also super spicy. main courses channa bhatura probably my favorite indian dish ever. this gigantic fried, puffy dough comes out and hot steam actually comes out when you tear into it. it is such a wonderful sight! then you dip the bread into this wonderfully flavorful chickpea dish and you can expect what my roommate calls a food baby for the rest of the evening. so worth it. i've had this dish at vik's chaat in berkeley, but the puffy thing is overly greasy there. it is actually quite light and flavorful here. paper masala dosa this is what i came to try, the infamous paper masala dosa . it is actually humungous so, if you can visualize, three girls at the smallest table possible with the giant bhatura and now this long dosa too. i think we were in a little over our heads when we ordered so our waiter advised us on how to eat this, by tearing off a piece of the crispy dosa and dipping it into the potato mixture and then dipping it into one of three sauces sambar, a tomato sauce and a coconut sauce. we ended up mixing and matching everything on our table, which was an extremely pleasant experience for our tastebuds haha. the only complaint about this dish is that the dosa itself is a little salty, so dipping it is kind of necessary to offset the saltiness. dessert rasmalai i do not know how we managed to do this because we basically had carbs for our entire meal, but we ended up picking this. it is a surprisingly light dessert even though it is creamy and has the texture of panna cotta but is made of cheese! the rosewater fragrance is really nice and the pistachios add a great texture. perfect way to end such a heavy meal. the total came out to be after tax and tip. the best part was probably our waiter who explained how to eat everything haha. definitely coming back to try all the other different dosas .and to have something with meat."
58,,Raina B.,1118,4.0,5/24/2012," . stars now this is yelp, the thank you economy, and pure customer service done right. the owner reached out to me regarding my aok review and welcomed me to come back and try a few appetizers on him. i literally live blocks away so my roommates and i stopped by here on tuesday night for dinner . their dinner offerings were excellent. all the items provide very generous servings and they definitely kicked up the spice a notch with these dishes. we got the following chaat mangos in chaat who would have thought. apparently this is a south indian norm to put fruit in chaat and i do not know why us northerners have not picked up on how good that is. dahi vada amazing presentation and great taste. they really know how to take indian street food and make it classy pakora to be fair, i'm not a fan of these generally so i have a bit of a bias against this dish. clever take on the chutneys mimicking ketchup and mustard. paper masala dosa solid traditional dosa dish. ask for extra of the orange chutney. nom. basil dosa of us are indian and have grown up with all this goodness. this dosa made all of us take a step back and admire how they made this. it is like pesto meets masala . very good. channa batura seriously, the batura was bigger than my head. insane. the channa was excellent. the batura was definitely a little oily for my liking but that tends to happen when its deep fried. needless to say, i definitely had my mind changed and cannot wait to make this a neighborhood regular. cheers to your restaurant, anjan."

66,,Apoorva A.,1118,4.0,7/24/2018,"for my family, dosas comfort food. when you are hungry and just want something flavorful and filling, dosas are usually a goto. so, when we walked in to dosa on fillmore, we had very high expectations. walking in through the large heavy door, you are instantly greeted by the heavenly aromas of south indian cuisine in an open room, lit by elegant chandeliers. we came in at around pm on a saturday evening without a reservation and opted to sit at the communal table to avoid the wait. luckily, we got a spot at the end, so it was not too cramped for the four of us. our server was friendly and attentive, despite being quite busy, and patiently answered all of our questions. my family and i ordered the idli sambar, chile garlic dosa, rava masala dosa, masala dosa, and spicy mung masala dosa. the complimentary papadum was thin and crispy, although a couple of the pieces were slightly stale. the idli sambar was fantastic the idlis were perfectly soft and not too grainy as some restaurants tend to make them, and the sambar was so flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. all of our dosas were pretty great good texture, just the right amount of soft and crispy, and strong spices spread across the chile garlic and the spicy mung dosas. the only thing lacking was a little more flavor in the potato filling in each dosa it could have used a tad more salt and masala. otherwise, the dosas were filling and made for a great meal. we left around , and the place seemed to still be bustling. i wish we would tried the desserts they sounded decadent but we were already so full from the dosas. next time i would probably try more of the shared plates for greater variety. the prices are on the higher end, but food, service, and ambience all make it worth it."
67,,Ajay G.,1118,1.0,7/22/2018,"we ordered dosas and idli fries. the idlies were over fried and the chutney did not have any salt. the mushroom utthappam was undercooked. all in all, not really worth the price, except for great ambience and atmosphere."
68,,Bob K.,1118,4.0,6/17/2018,"great indian spot near japantown good dosas, fantastic pepper shrimp and some incredible chicken and pork curries. really loved the avocado appetizer as well. idli , samosas chicken were familiar and super yummy. would have appreciated a bit more help navigating the menu instead of us saying what do you recommend and the server asking well, what do you like "
69,,Pragyan P.,1118,4.0,6/15/2018,"just satisfy your appetite and make your day complete with the yummy south indian food, loved avocado chat and vada pav sliders, idli fry. amazing ambience and cool place to hang out with friends!!!!"
70,,Manojna K.,1118,3.0,5/1/2018,"south indian food with a twist. i am not a fan of paneer but their paneer matar dosa was sooo good it melts in your mouth. loved the avocado chaat, idli fries, mango lassi with a hint of cardamom, and the uthappam sampler. the sambar was pretty fantastic too. the only let down of this place we are the chutneys. all of them were bland for my liking."
71,,Nibha K.,1118,3.0,4/27/2018,"hmm.so stars for the ambience! but the food is just about average. it is really over priced south indian food which does not even taste like authentic south indian food. we ordered the vada sambar, idli fries and rava masala dosa. all of these were just okay, nothing great at all. have had amazing south indian food at other places in the bay area, so this is nothing in comparison to that. but yes the ambience is really good. so combining the ambience and the average food you will still have a good dining experience overall."
72,,Harsha P.,1118,5.0,3/30/2018,accommodated us as walk ins on a busy night. was with a work colleague and they were quick to take our orders and serve us. the fried idli appetizer and the beet dahi vadas were absolutely amazing. we ordered the paper masala dosa and the paneer dosa. tons of food as we had to take some of the dinner entrees back for the next day. nice ambience and friendly service.
73,,Sophie W.,1118,2.0,3/22/2018,"reserved a table for at pm on wednesday, and when i called to move up my reservation to on the same day, i was told that they were all booked. this place is super popular, and entering through the nondescript door which is automatic, by the wayyou only need to give it a tug brings you into this cavernous world of chandeliers and smelling of spices. i will say it is a bit of a tight squeeze if you are sitting in the booths against the side walls you will probably get more intimate with the tables next to you than you will with your partner. we ordered the mango lassi, idli fries, chutney sampler, and masala dosa. the complimentary pappad was so thin and delicious, especially dipped in the chutney sampler. the sauces do pack a decent amount of heat, and the idli fries are super crispy and gluten free !! . however, we did discover that the two sauces we were given with the fries were the same as the ones in the chutney sampler. poor planning on our part and lack of creativity on theirs. i was probably least impressed with the dosa. the sauces it came with were not flavorful enough, and there was only a small patch of potatoes in the very center. you cannot skimp on potatoes like that and think it is okay, especially if you are charging for what is essentially an oversize crepe. i think you can get better dosas elsewhere for lower prices, and the only justification dosa gets for charging what it does is the ambiance."
74,,Neil B.,1118,1.0,2/17/2018,"i brought my family who was visiting for philadelphia on a saturday night, and the ambiance looked promising. first off we were not even provided a drink menu. we ordered an assortment of shared plates including idli fries, vada pav, brussel sprouts, and avocado bhel. we spoke with the waitress letting her know that my wife was allergic to chickpeas, she confirmed with the chefs and informed us that she could have everything except the vada pav. turns out the avocado bhel had chickpeas, which we informed our waitress about and later spoke with the manager about. manager then confirmed that the rest of our dosas and uttapam order will have no chickpeas. ridiculously, everything contained it. the sambhar has chickpeas, the dosa potato filling had chickpeas. the manager confirmed with the chefs and they blatantly lied and denied that there was chickpeas. the manager had to show the actual split chickpeas in the filling before they accepted it. plain ridiculous and unacceptable. our waitress was also very slow and did not check up on us. we accidentally spilled water and despite staring right at us did nothing to help. which for a high end establishment is just plain wrong. apart from those major issues, the overall food was pretty average. shared plates were good, but the dosas were standard indian fare, could not taste any pear flavor in the pear masala dosa, the uttapams were not fully cooked, and the sauces chutneys were subpar. if you are looking for modern indian cuisine there are many better options in the city. dosa was very disappointing and i would not recommend it."
75,,Praveen K.,1118,5.0,1/19/2018,"lamb sliders, vada pav, idli fries, all dosas, pani poori and awesome cocktails. yummm . must visit"
76,,Shatakshi G.,1118,4.0,1/7/2018,"tried this restaurant for the first time during the new year week and everything for the table was super good both north indian and south indian food. we had already done reservation as we were a big party of people. when we arrived for dinner they had set aside the table for us. we ordered idli fries and vada pav as appetizers. the vada pav is a must try. it was one of the best you can have around bay area. for the main course we ordered a variety of dishes including extremely spicy mixed chille uttapam, idli sambar, moong daal dosa, south indian moons uttapam, spicy pear dosa and roasted chille and garlic dosa. all the dishes were delicious, a contemporary blend of authentic south indian flavors without being too overpowering on the spices. the sambar which came with all the dosa's and uttapam's was especially mind blowing. interiors are nicely done. it is clean and the service is quick. we had to circle around for a bit to find parking. price wise it is a bit on the expensive side . deducted one star for the server who was not very friendly and pleasant to talk to. apart from that a great experience. will recommend to try it out atleast once if you are in around the area."
77,,Ani J.,1118,4.0,1/2/2018,"since the first time i tried this place in , i have been a fan. this is easily one of the places i visit when i travel to san francisco. i had not been there in many years, so when my trip to san francisco finalized, i knew i was going back for sure. i actually ended up eating here twice during my recent trip. the food is still as good. i did end up trying a few new things. but the service has gone down for sure, hence, taking a point off. the service is slow, the servers not as attentive. one of the servers came to our table after we had been waiting for minutes. as soon as she arrived, she said are you ready to order no greeting, no nothing. kind of a turn off at a fancy restaurant as this one. now to the food idli fries unique idea for sure as i have never had idli fries before. its definitely on the spicy side, as they pour red chilli powder on it. so make sure you can handle spice before you order this. vada paav still as good as how i remember from . absolutely love it. rava masala dosa delicious.i always prefer the rava dosa crust over the other dosas. chana bhatura the channa chickpeas is a blend of fava beans and chickpeas, which is a bit of an interesting blend. i would personally prefer just the regular chana indian style . ras malai delicious dessert. madras coffee usually the madras coffee i have had is served in a steel glass, but this one comes in a regular cup. its really good and worth trying. after years, i am still a fan. i may not visit the golden gate bridge, but i will surely visit this place every time i go to san francisco "
78,,Kim B.,1118,1.0,12/18/2017,"honestly, this used to be my absolute favorite restaurant for years in san francisco. i moved away to co about two years ago, and came back recently to dine there, and it was the worst indian food i've ever had. i asked the waitress why everything was so different, and she said they recently had some menu changes. i could not be more depressed about this. i ordered the idli fries as an appetizer, which were unimpressive and the prawn masala as my entree. the curry to the prawn masala tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry. my mom ordered a chicken curry, which also had a watery consistency, and no flavor. this is one of the pricier indian restaurants, and i had always felt it was worth it perviously, but if you are thinking of going there now, i would advise you to save your money."
79,,Goutam M.,1118,3.0,12/8/2017,"not worth the hype. the fried idlies were good, the rest, dosas and chicken fry, were average."
80,,Cin-Yee S.,1116,5.0,11/5/2018,"if i had more money, i would be awash in coconut cream pies, lemon cream tarts, and morning buns with a hint of orange . a worthwhile treat, and easy to get if you show up a few minutes before it opens at am."
81,,Mary X.,1116,4.0,10/22/2018,"pretty long waits throughout the day, but you have to try the banana cream tart. it was the best i've had mission pie comes very close . the crust is phenomenal and there is a caramelized flavor to it that makes it that much better. the croissants are huge and the lamination on them are pretty spot on. i personally thought the croissant was too crunchy though, was looking for a bit of fluff in the middle. morning bun was also very flaky and firm. i do not really eat morning buns though so i do not know how they should taste. the chocolate chip walnut cookie is big but very flat and super crispy. i enjoyed it, despite know all that extra butter is probably the secret to the nice crunch it has. would come back to try their lemon meringue cake and other cream tarts!"
82,,Alex C.,1116,5.0,9/24/2018,"holy smokes. the morning buns . everything they make here is good. but the morning buns are on another level. i've had good croissants, scones, tea cakes. but i have not had a morning bun , cinnamon bun , breakfast roll that was as good as their morning buns . if anything, it is worth the wait for one of those. normally the wait is minutes, so do not be surprised if the line is just outside the door."
83,,Shelley P.,1116,5.0,9/22/2018,"mornings are for morning buns ! this was my second time visiting san francisco and tartine, and i was not disappointed. i went late monday morning and was pleased to find a short line. i was mesmerized by all the options but since morning buns are one of their most popular options, i decided to go with that having also had fond memories from last time . all the workers i interacted with were so incredibly friendly as well one of them even gave me recommendations for where to walk around in sf as i was wandering around that day. i decided to take a while to sit and journal at one of the tables inside here's some of my badgrammar ramblings about the pastry i take bites of my morning bun slowly because i want to savor every bite & because it was freaking expensive hah. but its worth it a delightful crispy flakiness on the outside it snaps into pieces as you bite, but it is held together by the caramelized sugar that covers it, slightly sticky on your teeth, tinted with orange like the grownup version of those orange slice gummies from your childhood. the sugar crystals fall in love with the corners of your mouth, as your tongue falls in love with the buttery softness of the bun , & as your mind starts to wonder if you could ever live in a world without baked goods. "
84,,Laura K.,1116,4.0,9/1/2018,loved the morning buns ! i agree with other reviews that orange flavored foods generally are a big no but this is an exception. very flaky with the right moisture content. bread was also yummy. i would skip the coffee though as there are better options in the mission district.
85,,Clare L.,1116,4.0,8/31/2018,"banana cream tart . tart is very light and creamy and the crust is buttery, flaky and crunchy. it is sweet but not overpowering! their banana cream tart was the only thing i got from tartine bakery so i cannot say much about other pastry. but it is definitely worth a try and wait! next time, i would like to try their morning buns ! if i am in the area, i would take banana cream tart and morning buns to go with my coffee and enjoy them at dolores park! the only reason i took one star off is price.it seems like everything there is bit pricey."
86,,Cameran L.,1116,5.0,8/20/2018,"do not be deterred by the long lines to get in. it is worth the wait. go here for the banana cream tart and the morning buns , then take them to go with your favorite coffee and a blanket and sit on the lawn at dolores park. these heavenly moments are what living in san francisco is all about."
87,,D D.,1116,5.0,7/12/2018,"tldr highly recommended! here's what to do to make the most of your visit time your trip properly. be patient since there is almost always a line. savor the delicious treats and breads that are obviously baked with love. repeat again and again! overall rating a+++ i'm from nyc so i know good bakeries. during my one week vacation in san francisco, this was the only place i had to come back to a second time. i loved it that much! yes, there was always a wait when i went around pm. but it was totally worth it! dessert is my favorite meal so this was heaven for me. i love they treat their coop employees well and they get to sleep at night. on the flip side that means you need to wait until staggered times throughout the day to get certain things, such as first thing in the morning to get their morning buns + breakfast goodies after am for made to order hot sandwiches minute wait after pm for breads longer if you want half loaves since they need to cool keep in mind they do run out of things as it gets later! so make sure to time your trip properly to get what you want! if you come before the breads are ready, they will write your name and bread order they do half loaves! on their bread list. they will call your name when your delicious carbs are ready and you pay for the breads upon pick up. here's what i tried across my visits latte . i'm not a huge coffee fan, but i sampled my friend's latte and it was amazing! not that bitter even without any sweetener. i was so enamored i got a small bag of the coffee beans to take home ! strawberry mousseline cake . hands down my favorite of everything i tried here! the whipped cream was nice and light. the strawberries were fresh though oddly whole so a bit awkward to eat share . the cake layer was moist. what is not to love tastes like a better version of strawberry shortcake. the slice is pretty small though. might be a seasonal cake so enjoy it while you can! a+++ chocolate souffle cake slice . valrhona chocolate mousse on a thin layer of chocolate cake topped with chocolate ganache if you like chocolate, you will love this! layers of decadent chocolate and it was not too sweet. a+ chocolate hazelnut tart . sweet pastry she will, guanaja, orange i was not a huge fan of this myself. i just did not like the orange flavor in this, but that is a personal preference. b+ eclair . vanilla cream, valhrona glaze not a fan of eclairs and this did not change my mind about them, but my mother liked it. b half olive bread . only available wed, fri, and sun holy moly! i want to eat this everyday! this was my favorite of the breads. i regret not getting a whole loaf of this, but i already had so much bread from the day before. i needed to wait until my next visit to try this since they are only available days a week! excellent texture, just wish there were more olives. the olives had a slight citrus flavor. try to eat the bread right away. i've never had such fresh bread in my life! it had literally just came out of the oven! a+++ sesame bread . great but not as good as the olive bread. a half ancient grain bread . nice and hearty. but not as good as the olive bread. a i really wanted to try the porridge bread but it did not bake properly that day. fyi all the bread i tried were very crusty and on the harder side. though the inside was light and soft! there is % surcharge on your bill to support employee benefits, which i think is great. the employees are super sweet! they patiently explained all the daily breads and bread ordering procedures to me. i think all their breads are sourdough based. love that they have self serve water on the side with compostable packaging utensils here. there is a bathroom between the register and coffee bar. you may even get to see them pulling out fresh breads from their giant oven if you come around pm on your way to the bathroom! if there is no where to sit at tartine, walk to the nearby gorgeous mission dolores park to enjoy your treats al fresco! the prices are a little higher here, but it is so worth it. i spent almost here over days. no regrets! i would definitely come here again the next time i'm in san francisco!"
88,,Florence A.,1116,4.0,7/9/2018," pm on a friday and the line is out the door for good reason! the baked goods are outstanding croissants, chocolate croissants and morning buns were on my purchase list. i was sorry to miss their kouign amann, which i hear is wonderful. i will definitely go back to try more!"
89,,Sarah R.,1116,5.0,7/8/2018,"the morning buns are to die for, they have cinnamon with a hint of orange zest and they the crust from baking it perfect to break open. the location is quaint and fun to find because there is not sign, which makes this bakery even more fantastic, they do not need a sign to make it known."
90,,Eric H.,1116,5.0,7/5/2018,"every single time i visit the bay area, i have to visit tartine. morning buns are the best."
91,,Kedar M.,1116,4.0,6/27/2018,dropped by this place at am on a weekend morning . there was a min wait line. nice cutesy interiors. they have a few seater tables outside too. tried multiple other things. our favourites were the morning buns and the savory bacon scone. yum!! could not try the banana cream tarts as supposedly they were not going to be ready till am. will be back for more!
92,,Cesar R.,1116,5.0,6/5/2018,"sf is all about standing in lines, but this bakery is actually worth it! from morning buns to almond croissants, no crumbs left on my plate!"
93,,Patrick S.,1116,5.0,6/3/2018,"tartine bakery is going to be the ruin of any diet plans! whenever i do want to splurge in the city, i make a stop by tartine. as one gets closer to the establishment, one can delightfully enjoy the smells of the bakery. unfortunately, everytime i drop by there is always a line to order something from their delicious bakery with the morning times understandably having the longest lines. i have ordered a variety of different things here but here are a list of things that i have particularly enjoyed banana creme tart the tart particularly nails the banana flavor with nicely sliced pieces of banana layered in the filling. but the nice surprise is the layers of milk chocolate along the pie crust which make for a beautiful match made in tastebud heaven. morning buns they would be a welcome pick me up for any day! not knowing what these were, they are basically a flaky croissant like pastry lightly flavored with a orange zest that could easily be laced with crack! croque monsieur enveloped with golden bread to indicate the buttery goodness that has soaked in each of the slices and then filled with hearty pieces of cheese and ham. surprisingly, it never feels awfully heavy where i am in an induced food coma. these come with pickled carrots that definitely provide a welcome acidity to cut through. the service is fast and friendly. the space inside the actual establishment is small so if you are planning to have a nice brunch with a bunch of your friends you are better off planning to take these goodies to go and walk off to the park. parking is limited and again may be better to walk over. overall, tartine bakery has a lot of great pastries that are worth picking up and enjoying in the city."
94,,Miya M.,1116,5.0,6/2/2018,the morning buns are the most delicious pastry ever! the line is long the it is worth it!
95,,Christina R.,1116,4.0,5/31/2018,"definitely a staple. there is a reason people will wait in long lines just to get a single treat or loaf of bread. there is a reason young cooks clamor their way into this kitchen and take pride in saying they have worked here. everything is delicious and worth your wait in line. i try to try a different item every time i come out because i just cannot eat it all at once. the portion sizes are actually quite large and the items are pretty rich. this time around i got a chocolate croissant and a lemon bar. sooooo gooooood!! i can say that the scones esp savory are incredible, as well as the morning buns . and the bread! i also have not noticed a dip in quality over the years. i mean the place has been open over years and it is super popular. a lot of places like that tend to dip quality wise and rely on their name alone. i really wanted to try their coffee. i feel like i should have but i was not in a coffee mood. for sure i will next time."
96,,Angela L.,1116,5.0,5/30/2018,"there has to be a reason why there is always a line out the door, why people are willing to wait up to minutes just to get inside, why there are thousands of raving reviews. and that reason is morning buns . and the lemon cream tart. and the savory scone. and the lemon bar. it was our first time here and we did not know what to expect. obviously parking in the city is tough, but we found a meter a few blocks away. we got there around am, so i was worried about the wait. the line wrapped around the corner, but it went by quickly. it was longer by the time we left. the employees were kicking ass with the never ending line. they got us in and out quickly and painlessly. we had to stop ourselves from ordering more than morning buns . i had read tons of yelp reviews raving about those delicious pastries, and i knew that i had to try one.or five. we also picked up a lemon cream tart and a lemon bar because my boyfriend absolutely loves all things lemony. man, that tart was just heavenly so smooth, so creamy, so decadent. the lemon bar was the perfect combination of tart and sweet, and the pine nut crust was so buttery and crumbly. with all this sweetness, we also picked up a savory scone for some salty counterbalance. my god, what a clutch decision to get that scone. it was probably the best scone i had ever had in my life. i was initially hesitant about trying it because scones are usually too dry for my liking, but this bad boy was buttery and moist from the cheese and it packed a helluva flavor punch from the bacon. i'm salivating just thinking about it. everything tasted amazing fresh out of the box, and they surprisingly held up well after a day or two, so we had a wonderful treat for our trip home. totally worth the wait, i'm looking forward to trying everything else!"
97,,Josh N.,1116,5.0,5/19/2018,"amazing holy grail of bakeries in sf. i live here and still make a quarterly if not more trip to the original tarting for morning buns , croissants, bread loaves and most importantly bread pudding. this place simply makes the best bp i have ever had in my life. go early morning when they open or mid afternoon before when they serve bread to reduce your wait in line. it can be large but it moves quickly and the pastries are delicious. i like darker roasts of coffee so, for me, the coffee here tastes too bright and acidic. other people seem to like it fine"
98,,Karissa A.,1116,5.0,4/27/2018,if i could give this place stars i would the lemon tarts are amazing i want to order like whenever i go. the morning buns are delicious they taste like a sugar bun with a hint of orange and they are a little bit sticky and they taste so amazing like heaven. the bread pudding is good too i would drive hours just for this place. if you want to get there before they sellout go before pm
99,,Al W.,1116,4.0,4/25/2018,"the line was minimal during late afternoon. however, the downside was they were out of morning buns and their famous lemon tart. i settled for their seasonal fruit tart, which was not very impressive. i ve had many tarts that were just as good, if not better. but i also bought a lemon tea cake and that blew my mind away. it was so dense and moist with a nice, sweet outer layer. i've never tasted any thing like it. i would rate the tea cake a five and the tart as a three star, hence, my four star rating. i would definitely come back to try all their other items based off the level of execution on their tea cake."
100,,John L.,1116,5.0,11/2/2018,"candied orange and cinnamon sugar they are not as common a combination as peanut butter and jelly, thunder and lightning, or russell westbrook and poor fg percentage, but tartine bakery and cafe surely did their homework to roll them up into the finest morning bun ever. dipped in even more sugar, it was surprisingly not as sweet as it looked. it is flaky, buttery, and cinnamony, much like a cross between a croissant and a cinnamon roll in full swing! the morning bun alone is reason enough to come back, but the croque monsieur with shiitake mushroom will make the decision even easier. simply put, a croque monsieur is a ham and cheese sandwich but a lot better. their offering came with a choice of ham, turkey, shiitake mushroom, or fromage blanc. our order came nicely baked with plenty of mushrooms and melted gruyere cheese. my younger daughter enjoyed it so much that she wanted a single slice to be her next birthday cake. we just need to buy some candles! we also tried the huge gougere savory choux pastry with gruyere cheese and the largerthanusual pain au chocolat chocolate croissant . they were also delicious, but not as impressive as the other two items we had. the quiche , scone, croissant, cookie, tart, and cake looked appetizing as well, but we would have gone home broke had we decided to try them all. the wait was long and the prices were steep, but the quality and taste of the food were superior. seating oneself could be a challenge, but mission dolores park is just a couple of blocks away. enjoy the stroll while slowly nibbling away at that delightful morning bun."
101,,Kevin N.,1116,5.0,10/24/2018,"do yourself a favor a take a day off work and treat yo self with some delicious food from tartine. the line is totally worth it, but if you want to avoid the hassle, try to come on a weekday. the place itself is pretty small. if you have a large party, do not expect to be seated. they have a few tables inside and then three tables outside. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant. must get. morning bun sweet and delicious. the orange really comes through the whole bun and not just the outside quiche i've never had a quiche this perfect before. the egg is the perfect soft consistency sourdough take a giant loaf home. so tasty and will last you a while"
102,,Christopher L.,1116,5.0,10/21/2018,"omg do not get me started on tartine. i've been here at least times so far and have been coming at least twice a month since i've moved here it is rare that i go anywhere more than once . it also does not help that i live a block away from this delightful, delicious bakery. the pastries they make here are probably the best i've ever had in the city. i would say my favorite are the almond croissant and the banana cream tart. i've also tried the regular croissant, chocolate croissant, ham and cheese croissant, morning bun, buttermilk scone, lemon meringue cake, ham and egg quiche and the croque monsieur with ham. so i will speak about the croissants in general. the croissants they create here are huge, you might think that is crazy for a croissant but i've paid for croissants that are half the size. here, they are super sized and can be a meal in itself! the croissants have a dry, crunchy surface that breaks super easily, but a warm, cozy, fluffy inside that almost melts in your mouth. their croissants here are so good and you would be fine choosing any croissant. the banana cream tart is even more filling, it really satisfies the craving for any sweet tooths out there. it comes with banana, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate flakes and a whole bunch of other goodness. one of the best tarts i've ever had. all the other things i've tried all of them are pretty solid. things that were pretty average were the morning bun and their scones, but still pretty decent. honestly, you cannot go wrong here! when in doubt, any of the things first listed in it is section is pretty solid. also prepare to wait here! unless you come really early. there is often a line that can take anywhere from minutes before when you line up and when you pay for your order. also do not come too late because they usually run out of the best things early on."
103,,Auriyon J.,1116,5.0,10/14/2018,"ive tried so many things from them and they are all so yummy! the bread pudding is sooooo good! they also have super good brownies, chocolate cake and quiche ! i love this bakery so much!!!!!"
104,,Jang N.,1116,5.0,10/10/2018,the best bakery i have ever been to! it is the closest thing to bakeries i've had in france. i'm a huge fan of eclairs and they have the best eclairs i have ever tasted. i'm also a huge fan of croissants and they also had the best croissants. their morning bun is as good as advertised! their pies are also really good and their quiches are decent i'm usually do not like quiches . make sure you try the banana cream tart. super sweet but super delish! do not let the long lines fool ya it goes by pretty quickly
105,,Katie Y.,1116,5.0,9/11/2018,"wow. easily the best croissant i've ever had. the line was a bit ridiculous and it moves incredibly slow it was a saturday morning, so i think everyone had the same idea we had . i think we got a little carried away in attempting to essentially purchase almost one of every pastry, but it was well worth it. the quiche was delicious, you could tell that the crust was homemade and was cooked to perfection. the pastries were unbelievable, i expected they would be good but the croissants literally tasted like butter, while maintaining such a beautiful, flaky texture as someone who is baked croissants before, i have a much greater respect for people who do this well . the coffee was made at a separate counter and also did not disappoint. the shop is rather small, and some of the tables get in the way of the line, and the line gets in the way of utensil water area. i imagine it was not designed to handle the massive crowds that it attracts. wish they would take some of their profits and expand the place a little, because it is just not meant to handle the amount of people who visit their shop everyday. i also love that you can look into the kitchen in the back and watch the pastry chefs, live, make all the delicious food at the counter. highly recommend for a pastry and a coffee."
106,,Justina L.,1116,3.0,8/10/2018,"got the almond croissant, morning bun, corn quiche , freshly squeezed oj and americano for ~ . food was good but not necessarily something i would go out of my way and line up for."
107,,Phil N.,1116,5.0,8/5/2018,"in the footprint of iconic carls bakery lies tartine. tartine is a icon unto itself. the bakery goods at artfully detailed. however, unlike some, these beauties run deep with flavor. i have had most everything in the case at this point. all i can say, is pick your poison and you will not be disappointed. caution you order at the counter. there will be lines. you can expect to wait minutes but it is worth the wait. tables turn pretty quickly and it is a good idea to have a person in your party grab one as you enter the building. another tip. it is easy to go right to the cake case. however, , the croque monsieur, quiches ,and buttermilk scones are worth a try"
108,,Mark W.,1116,4.0,7/5/2018,"truly great pastries, sandwiches, quiche , pie, deserts, and coffee. it is not cheap but the quality is exceptional. the only downside is the line. i understand that people in sf are willing to wait for great food but there is never a line."
109,,Molly M.,1116,3.0,7/5/2018,"yes, its good. the quiche of all things! is one of my faves. as its all so nice and tasty, i try to go when there is no line and see what is left. never been disappointed. there are a mountain of bakeries in sf. and you are in the mission. so choose your calories. and come back when you can!"
110,,Melody K.,1116,4.0,7/5/2018,"the scent of freshly baked goods that hits you as soon as you walk in the door of tartine is seriously heaven! it does not smell overly and sickly sweet, but instead you get that bready, baked, homey smell that anyone who enjoys bread, pastries, and carbs in general would appreciate. lemon cream tart definitely worth trying! if i'm eating something with the words lemon and tart in it, that is exactly what i expect and that is exactly what i got! the crust was a little hard for my liking so it was difficult to cut with a fork, but overall my mouth was experiencing lemon heaven. the cream on the top is very light and complements the tart and thick lemon filling super well! chocolate souffle cake if you are a chocolate lover, then you have to get this. it is super rich, dense, and chocolatey what more could you ask for in a chocolate cake the dark chocolate ganache layer is aaamazing the bitterness balances out the sweetness of the whole cake. not to mention, the gold paper on top makes you feel super fancy! but if you enjoy more of a cakey texture, then this may not be the cake for you since it represents more of a souffle than a cake. tip this cake goes super well with a cup of coffee! croissant a must get! this was probably the priciest croissant i've ever paid for . for one croissant , but it is huge!! plus the outer flakiness, layered buttery goodness and mouthwatering aroma words cannot even describe, you just have to get it yourself to see exactly what i mean is definitely worth every penny. i've been here twice and each time i had to get their croissant. when you bite into it, the sound alone is to die for and would make for great asmr sound effects! next time i'm in the area, i definitely have to stop in to try their quiches , banana cream tart, and fruit tart!"
111,,Falcon J.,1116,4.0,6/19/2018,nice little cafe with great food. quiche and croque monsieur were both delicious. indoor and outdoor seating.
112,,Amanda K.,1116,4.0,6/12/2018,my first time trying quiche ~~ soft and delicious. fresh bakeries and dessert! unfortunately you have to wait in line quite a while it was monday am to order and not much space inside.
113,,P. A.,1116,5.0,5/27/2018,"fantastic breakfast. arrived around . am to quite a line just come prepared. it moved relatively quickly though, so do not despair. we got a morning bun, mushroom croque monsieur, quiche , and a savory scone. no regrets. the quiche was exceptional, and i loved the pickled carrots with the croque. our friends got the ham and cheese croissant and loved it. a guy said that if we decided to get another item we could just go up to the register and tell them we already paid so that we would not have to wait in the line again. he recommended the tarts to go. we might have to try it."
114,,Nicole L.,1116,5.0,5/20/2018,"tucked in the heart of the mission, this neighborhood bakery is not to be missed. i enjoyed a slice of chard & green garlic quiche and a macchiato, both made with love. cozy seating area perfect for sharing with new found friends. i also ordered a savory bacon frommage blanc scone to go. i've heard there can be a line out the door, do not hesitate for a moment to get in that queue."
115,,J P.,1116,5.0,5/9/2018,"their bread pudding is fantastic, so is there quiche and cake. the only thing that is not amazing is their chocolate chip cookie."
116,,Arianna R.,1116,5.0,5/6/2018,"omg. i do not expect any other quiche to live up to the ham and cheese quiche at tartine. it was perfect. get the morning bun. tartine tastes like france. it is amazing. expect a line, even if you arrive early. a friend and i came here at am on a sunday morning and there was already a line of people, but at least we were able to get a table when it opened at ."
117,,Levi C.,1116,5.0,4/20/2018,there is a lot of hype about restaurants in san francisco but i have to admit the tartine bakery lives up to it. actually they superseded my expectations. they make some of the flakiest croissants i've ever tasted. as a matter of fact they are on a whole other level of perfection and i have not even spoke about the banana cream pie or the quiche . go early to beat the lines and if you go during winter time bring your coat. they keep the doors wide open and it can get pretty cold if you are not prepared. seating is limited and you will share a space so make some new friends.
118,,Tami N.,1116,5.0,3/29/2018,"wow. just. wow. thought this was just going to be one of those overhyped places people stand in long lines to go into and order some pretty overpriced pastries just for the 'gram, but it is worth it. our uber dropped us off at about ish in the morning and there was a line outside the place. luckily i spied an open table in the tiny, crowded bakery and snatched it up right away while my brother and husband waited to order. we can debate whether or not that was the right thing to do, but it was chilly outside and we wanted to order coffee and bunch of stuff. yeah. they waited in line for about ish minutes and our sweet pastries were brought out first, with the quiches and croque monsieur coming out about minutes later. the pastries stole the show for sure. the morning bun and coconut tarts were just orgasmic. yes, all three of us moaned with each bite we took, eyes rolled to the back of our heads. thank god you are not in mn."
119,,A P.,1116,4.0,3/23/2018,"we landed here at about am on a saturday to a nontrivial line out onto the sidewalk that only got longer with time. we ended up purchasing a great variety of pastry, including a slice of ham and leek quiche , frangipane croissant, morning bun, pain au jambon hamandcheese croissant , gougere onion and cheese pastry , lemon cream tart, and banana cream tart per the many, many recommendations here . may have gotten a few more pastries i cannot recall. this was definitely not a cheap excursion. these pastries ran us north of , tax included. that said, most everything was good, and several were great. the gougere was a surprise hit, flaky, pungent with onion but not overpowering, and probably a good bet for vegetarians sorry vegans, i think they contain cheese . the quiche and hamandcheese croissant were both very solid. as i expected from reading the many reviews here, the banana cream tart was far and away the star of the show. deliciously pudding custardy texture not too sweet or too bland, but exactly right. i noticed they have full piesized banana cream tarts as well something to explore later, i think. sadly, the lemon tart was the biggest miss. bland and did not really have much lemon flavor. give it a pass. i did not find all pastries to be uniformly amazing, the prices were steep, and nobody enjoys waiting in line. if it were not for those issues, this place would have gotten stars from me. also, since this is the mission, there is no parking to be had either. i will probably be back sometime in future, but unless you are a local with time to kill standing around in line without having to worry about parking, this is not an everyday visit kind of place."
120,,Sasha B.,1116,5.0,9/16/2018,"a mustgo stop in san francisco. delicious pastries and coffee that goes perfectly with them. when you order in the morning, the pastries will come out first. if you order coffee, expect another minutes for it to come out. if you order a sandwich, it will likely come out another minutes after the coffee. so this is a dessert first place if you are asking me! the line is never ending. from minutes prior to opening, to when they close. their loaves of bread are ready for purchase around pm. basically, just get in line so that you will be at the counter around . that is my best suggestion. also. be prepared that when you get to the counter, they may be sold out of something. for pastries, we went twice this week and we tried a frangipane croissant , morning bun, buttermilk scone, savory scone, lemon cream tart, chocolate hazelnut tart. for coffee, we tried the valhrona mocha and cappuccino. the coffee was delicious, truly a craft coffee, and served at a temperature that is actually drinkable no worries about burning your tongue on the first sips . my favorite pastries were the frangipane croissant and the savory scone. try everything if you can! we also tried the idiazabal & membrillo sandwich and different loaves of bread ancient grain, porridge and walnut. the sandwich is like a gourmet grilled cheese. the bread truly makes the sandwiches here. you cannot go wrong with your selection. we took the loaves of bread back home to florida, and they are perfect for sandwiches, toast, snacks at home!"
121,,Alex R.,1116,4.0,6/30/2018,"i've waited years to come here and it did not disappoint! they were out of frangipane croissants bummer! but the double chocolate one held us over. great new matcha lattes! if you go, please get a rocher only . . changed my mind on the potential of meringues. also highly recommend the gougere! there was a line go early!!!!"
122,,Winnie Y.,1116,4.0,5/15/2018,"tartine bakery is another one of those places in sf with the lines wrapped around the block. i commend tartine for moving the line along fairly quickly and having copies of the menu available for people to look at so that they are ready to order once they are at the front. no extra charge for the carryout paper bag. lemon cream tart '' bold lemon flavor but excessively sweet make sure to spread the whipped cream over the entire tart because it will help balance out the sugary filling. possibly meant to shared between people. frangipane croissant almond cream tartine is quite generous with the cream, and they do a great job of spreading the cream evenly throughout the pastry instead of just putting a little smear at the center. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant excellent breakfast choice that was actually pretty big and filled me up. the saltiness from the ham and cheese was a little overpowering after a while, but it was still yummy! pain au chocolat chocolate croissant fairly plain with a touch of bittersweet chocolate, which showed off the flakiness of the crisp, buttery croissant . great choice if you are looking for something on the lighter and simpler side."
123,,Kathryn T.,1116,4.0,3/27/2018,"i happened to be up early on a monday and found myself in the mission district of sf. i heard about tartine before, so i decided to stop by with my boyfriend. we were lucky, the line was super short when we arrived! i guess normally the line is way longer, and it did get longer after we already got our pastries. i would recommend looking at the menu or more at yelp before you get to the front of the line, it is hard to see everything because the line kind of gets in the way. we ended up ordering the pain au jambon, frangipane croissant , and morning bun. i loved the morning bun, it was soft, sweet & citrusy, and so tasty! my boyfriend enjoyed the pain au jambon, the ham was super delicious. the frangipane croissant was good too, not too sweet. the outer croissant was a little hard, but the inside was soft, creamy, and almondy! this was a really nice bakery, i would stop by here again for a morning bun next time i'm in the area! and have some time to kill in a line."

125,,Stephanie F.,1116,4.0,11/20/2017,"ambience a cute little europeaninspired bakery that is around the corner from dolores park and is clearly well known for its breads and pastries. the line is well out the door, but was only about minutes or so on the sunday evening that i went. depending on the day, street parking is around the area, but as most places in the mission, it can definitely get crowded. making it inside, there was a sweet aroma of pastries, and a cozy bustling of baked goods and happy people! there were about three twoperson tables on one end of the store, and then a few larger tables for larger parties, or toshare tables. service was quick, sometimes a bit too quick, and friendly. food i got the morning bun, pain au chocolat, frangipane croissant , and the eversotasty ham and cheese croissant . all for alittle under approx. per pastry , these were a delectable, carby, sugary predinner meal. the morning bun was probably one of my favorite, a manylayered inverted croissant roll laminated with a sugary glaze, topped with sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest it was a perfect balance of sugary, moist yet crunchy goodness! another top seller for me was the ham and cheese croissant . so good, and such a wonderful contrast to all the sweet. the croissant was moist on the inside, with crunchy outer layers a great balance of ham and cheese on the inside and also made you feel like there was some nutrition with the sliver of protein. then came the pain au chocolat and frangipane which were both flakey croissant goodness as well. the chocolate croissant had a % cocoa chocolate on the inside which would have tasted so much better if it was warmed up. the frangipane was a lighter croissant and a tad on the dry side but did have an amazing brandy soaked layer on the inside that was then topped with frangipane cream an aromatic mix of butter, sugar, pastry cream, slivered almonds, and brandy . i will definitely be coming back to try out the paninis though, they were made with amazing looking bread and smelled . indescribable haha! overall, a good experience, solid stars cannot go without that morning bun and ham & cheese croissant !"
126,,Sara L.,1116,5.0,9/22/2017,"i have not been to france, so i cannot say the croissants are better, but the frangipane croissant was damn fantastic. i'm not sure what the whiny people are so hung up about the 'wait' or the 'line', they probably go at mid day with.everyone else. i went about an hour after they opened, smiling friendly staff quickly filled my order and i was out in no time, probably not even minutes. was a perfect experience and i cannot wait to go back!"
127,,Alex S.,1116,5.0,8/14/2017,"had to try this place given the positive reviews. it totally holds up. it is a small spot that surprisingly held everyone eating, ordering and waiting in line which wound out the door on a monday morning . i waited for maybe min really not that bad. but it did not have a touristy feel. most people in line seemed to be locals. the service was quick and helpful. i had the frangipane croissant and a cafe au lait. easily the best croissant i've ever had. big and super filling. incredibly flaky, but not dry. filled with a delicious almond filling and and topped with more tasty almond slivers. the cafe au lait was so good too. no extra cream or sugar needed. served in a big soup bowl that requires both hands to drink. both super simple and refined yet packed with flavor. i wish i lived in the area i would come back so many more times to try everything else that also looked amazing. this is a must in sf."
128,,Aries X.,1116,5.0,8/13/2017,"jesus. i've never seen so many people lining and waiting for almost an hour for pastries. you smell the cream and sugar when you walk close to the bakery. their most popular pastry is frangipane croissant . its almond flakes and almond cream gives it a moist and crispy texture, very very unique. they do have bread most popular is country after am, although that is not what most people come for. tartine has sourdough books published and are seen as advanced baking bibles in the baking industry."
129,,Anthony P.,1116,5.0,7/28/2017,"a memorable moment in the disney cartoon film ratatouille was when colette tatou shows linguini how to tell if a loaf of bread is good without ever tasting it. it is not the smell, it is not the look, but the sound, she tells him, crushing a loaf between her fingers. this statement cemented my dogmatic belief in selecting if bread is good or not. whether it is pastries, loaves, or any other baked goods, i took this opinion as a matter for my own tasting pleasure. before arriving in san francisco, i was recommended to visit tartine by a fellow classmate in my summer philosophy class. you have to go to tartine! she kept reminding me. finally, after so much determination on her part, i decided to take on her suggestion when visiting the city after summer semester ended. apart from getting lost in the mission district due to my gps app making me walk in the wrong direction, eventually i was able to find my way to the bakery. upon entering the establishment, i was taken aback from the smells, the sounds, and the many people that were crammed into this small space. going up to the counter, i asked the person helping me what he would recommend to a firsttime customer. something sweet and something savory was what i asked of him. he kindly recommended for me their ham and cheese croissant for the savory option and their frangipane croissant with almond cream for the sweet. along with the two, i also picked out their bread pudding because it looked so enticing sitting among the many other treats in display. all three treats along with a small coffee totaled about , which i took with a grain of salt being san francisco, but i can tell you the quality and tastes of the ingredients are very much worth the prices that are set. sitting down with my savory croissant and coffee, i took colette tatou's tip of choosing bread to the test, delicately pressing my fingers on the treat as the pastry crunched to the pressure. my expectations were met and i ripped a piece off, exposing the salty ham and melted cheese that were inside. it was obvious that this was not any ordinary croissant , with each layer being flakier than the next. the middle was soft and spongy, having a airy texture on the palette. it was a great pairing with the hot coffee to wash it down. overall, this is an excellent bakery you would not want to miss whether you live in the city or a passerby on the way to dolores park. the staff is genuinely helpful and the product they make is worth every cent."
130,,Bryan H.,1116,5.0,7/15/2017,"arguably the best bakery in san francisco. usually a line out the door at any hour of the day, but do not let it put you off as the line moves along at a decent pace. everything is good, but the coconut cream pie is my favorite. they line the pastry she will with dark chocolate before filling so the crust does not get soggy. same with the banana cream pie. lemon tart, frangipane croissant and cookies are great too. croque monsieur if you want something savory. parking in the area sucks, so take muni if you can. you can always get it to go and go to dolores park just a few blocks away."
131,,Esther Y.,1116,4.0,4/23/2017,"decent pastries!! a little over priced, but they are worth trying if it is your first time. always a long line, so make sure to go early. i went around am and there was still a line. i got the . frangipane croissant almond croissant . . . tbh it just tasted like a normal croissant , but a little better. it was super hard to eat, i spilled crumbs all over. . savory scone . not bad. i expected it to be very savory, but it was more bready and the flavor was not strong. . ."
132,,Maria B.,1116,5.0,1/4/2017,"tartine is worth the wait minutes to be exact! . the french country loaf was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. it was warm and delicious when we ripped into it. the butter added on is nice, but certainly not necessary. great surprise. the pastries were as expected delicious. the almond frangipane croissant was stellar, and the pain au chocolat did not disappoint. we also bought four tarts for my birthday, to be consumed three days later. wow. we were amazed at how well they kept up considering the moisture in the tarts. the crusts were perfect in all four. i highly recommend the banana cream, frangipane , lemon, and hazelnut chocolate. all were shared between four of us. we all felt fulfilled. my favorites if the four are the lemon and banana cream. yum."
133,,Miko B.,1116,5.0,12/21/2016,"have you ever seen that meme from futurama where fry yells, shut up and take my money! while waving a handful of cash that is literally how i feel every time i step into tartine. because my apartment is only a few blocks away, this is actually very dangerous. almost as dangerous as cliff jumping or shark diving. except i go like once a week. so yeah. sometimes, i just feel like i deserve a pat on the back for being such a daredevil, you know morning bun . stars the perfect marriage of a classic croissant and a cinnamon roll, this pastry is what tartine is best known for. think of a flaky croissant dough that is been rolled up and topped with sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest. these will be sold out come afternoon though a blessing in disguise since they are best eaten fresh. banana cream tart . for for stars i've always been a sucker for banana flavored pastries, and this one is no different. the bananas are ripe, the cream is succulent, the tart is flaky. perfectly balanced out with thin slivers of bitter dark chocolate. croissant . stars the first thing you realize about a tartine croissant is its ginormous size. the second is the dark brown exterior, almost to the point of being burnt. do not worry though this means it is more flavorful. the moment you hear that crunch and crackle while digging your teeth into this treat, you know you are in for a good time. chocolate eclair . stars a standard eclair that is excellently done. packed with vanilla cream and glazed with luscious valhrona chocolate. pure decadence. frangipane croissant . stars tartine's rendition of the almond croissant is filled with frangipane cream, which is composed of brandy syrup, pastry cream, and almonds. to finish, it is topped with powdered sugar and more crunchy almonds. ham quiche . stars a solid savory option to balance out all the sugar. the body of this quiche is light and silky. i'm pretty sure they use the same crust here as the banana cream tart so good. bread pudding . small . large stars served piping hot, the bread pudding was my least favorite of the bunch. although i did enjoy the tartness of the fruits, i thought the pudding itself was too mushy. this offputting texture made it feel like i was eating scrambled eggs."
134,,E G.,1116,5.0,10/21/2016,"the gold standard. favorites are the ham and cheese and frangipane croissants , the morning bun, the eclair, the passionfruit coconut cake and the shortbread. and the bananacream tart! and the turkeybroccoli rabe sandwich. and the country bread. oof it is fantastic. worth the line and the occasional customerservice miss . if you are visiting for the first time there are laminated menus in a stack by the door as you edge your way in. if no tables are free as is most often the case take your pastries to nearby dolores park!"
135,,L L.,1116,2.0,6/26/2016,"for a bakery with thousands of reviews and an average of stars, i'm quite puzzled by the lack of consistency. as someone who does not live in sf, i had happily waited or minutes and happily paid for an almost croissant . the plan was to save the croissant to enjoy on my flight back home. when i was actually on the flight and the carb craving hit, i smiled slyly to myself, thinking that i would get to polish off a flakey, buttery frangipane croissant while everyone else ate tiny mass produced pretzels. well, the croissant was burnt. the croissant was in the oven too long or the heat was too high or something. the entire outer . cm circumference of the croissant was brown. and as i stared at it, i recalled the image of the stack of croissants at the tartine counter. the entire display had croissants as dark as the one i was picking apart, trying to salvage it and eating the middle layers only. that thought actually made me more than disappointed since it meant they were selling a tray full of burnt pastries to customers without caring about the quality of today's batch. were they thinking they would not need to care about being good every day they do have enough loyalty and branding built in that yelp review does not matter. but tartine, i made my friend wait with me in that line, with the sun shining at us the entire time. and the end result was just an overpriced, low quality item."
136,,Thiago F.,1116,3.0,4/20/2016,"i bought basically everything the bakery had. it is just that after waiting under the sun for a halfblock line and the place's price i expected more. i was looking for things to satiate my sweet tooth but in the end nothing but the morning bun was as sweet as i wanted them to be and was by far the best thing i tasted from there. other than that the frangipane croissant was good could have been really good if i used butter or anything else on it, like a jam, peanut butter or nutella and both the banana cream tart and the frangipane tart were ok. the bread pudding barely had any taste the double pain au chocolat was not good even on the chocolate parts which it barely had the hazelnut chocolate tart was very light in flavor, basically and weirdly not sweet was not satisfying, just felt like a placeholder the cookie was just meh , i have eaten better from supermarkets the chocolate rye bar barely had any sweetness in the chocolate and in the meringue not satisfying and not even a pleasant flavor and came with a crazy sweet and flavored jam that was basically all i could feel whenever i took a bite that had it. it honestly felt like i was drinking orange essence or orange perfume. i do not get the hype and i do not plan on waiting on that line again. i may go back earlier much earlier! for a morning bun if it is on my way and i want to show it to someone visiting me."
137,,Aaron C.,1116,3.0,3/23/2016,"perhaps i'm just not a big pastry person or i did not order the right things, but it did not seem significantly better than other bakeries. we got the frangipane croissant and the gougere. they were good but i was not blown away considering the wait."
138,,Jhonna R.,1116,4.0,3/9/2016,"be prepared to wait in line, but the payoff is delicious. staff is super nice and keeps up with the fast pace. you do not even notice the wait if you are in line with your friends, but just because it lines up out past the door, down the street.i taketh a star. the three of us shared frangipane croissants morning bun pain au chocolat currant buttermilk scone counter culture coffee will make you wake up wishing you had one every morning"
139,,Ana G.,1116,5.0,2/19/2016,"i love everything i've ever had hereits my dessert happy place . the passionfruit coconut cake is my absolute favorite. it has light layers of sponge cake with a passionfruitlime filling and large flakes of coconut on top which resemble feathers on top of the cake. my second favorite is the coconut cream tart that has a layer of chocolate lining the bottom of the crust. the morning buns, brownies, eclairs, bread pudding, openfaced sandwiches are all great. oftentimes when you purchase a coconut macaroon from a bakery its a bit stale, but tartine's are always fresh with a light lemon taste too. my friend and i adore the frangipane croissants they are so rich, even eating half of one can be too much. its my absolute favoritecannot say enough about it!"
140,,b t.,1116,2.0,10/20/2018,"i'm a big fan of the tartine book and have baked beautiful breads from that book. so i grabbed the opportunity to go to the bakery while in sf. waited mins in line on saturday at pm and another mins to get my spicy turkey sandwich with broccoli rabe. to my utter disappointment, the sandwich was like eating mush encased in hard pressed greasy bread. you could not taste the turkey , or any distinct flavors. as strangers who shared my table said, it was like broccoli soup on your sandwich without knowing its broccoli. they had sadly ordered the same sandwich. i guess making great bread does not automatically mean you make great sandwiches."
141,,Oliver S.,1116,4.0,4/27/2018,"tartine does all the things a bakery should do, offering pastries, bread, sandwiches, coffee and more in a corner spot in the mission. there will be a line out the door even if you go midday during the week, but it is worth waiting at least once to experience this institution. many people enjoy the breads, which can be purchased by the loaf. you may also enjoy such items as morning bun, muffin, croissant, cappuccino, or frangipane tart. that one has been my favorite. surely you will see something as you wait to order that will make you say, i will get one of the ] when it is your turn. i'm a fan of the pastrami and spicy turkey sandwiches, though they are not quick. in sum, you will wait half an hour for some of the best bakery items you have ever tried, and you will pay quite a premium for doing so. what would cost you . and maybe a minute at the town bakery in bottineau, nd will run . plus wait time here. your call."
142,,Allison J.,1116,5.0,1/11/2018,"when there is always a line out the door and around the corner, you know they are doing something right! while you wait, the aromas of delicious baked good are constantly being wafted to you, tempting you with every step you take. but i guarantee that when you take that final step and walk away with your bag i recommend bags of pastries & croissants & sandwiches, it will all be worth it! below, i have documented all of our food for my own personal referencing, but when you go, just order whatever speaks to you! you cannot be led astray, because everything is good. but definitely do not walk in and order one thing. you waited for this. you earned this. get like pastries and sandwiches and then take a nap. pastries pain au chocolat chocolate croissant crispy outer pastry and stuffed with delicious chocolate pain au jambon smoked ham & gruyere croissant the effing best thing there! cheese and ham are smokey, savory, salty & that yummy croissant does it again crispy, yet soft . gougere this delicious light, puffy bread thing with gruyere cheese, pepper & thyme is again amazing morning bun basically a cinnamon bun, but better! even this nonsweet tooth loved this hot pressed sandwiches they take about additional minutes, but once again was worth the wait. spicy turkey the second best thing there! perfect panini with turkey , provolone and the most scrumptious & spicy broccoli rabe pesto! jambon royale & gruyere still great, but seriously stick with the spicy turkey . this ham & cheese is amazing, but still just a ham & cheese."
143,,Lindsey C.,1116,5.0,12/22/2017,"so, my first visit a few years ago to tartine was a doozy. i got some bakery items i probably should not have and then a car rammed into my bike that was locked up a few steps down the street. not a good day. however, i've been back and now finally get the oooh and ahhh. maybe they ramped up morning bun production on the weekends or i just got lucky but i came around noon pm on a saturday and they still had plenty. of course i got one, they are a must get for a reason, and a spicy turkey sandwich. damn. both were incredible. the morning bun was still soft and fluffy on the inside, flaky on the outside touch of orange came through nicely. the turkey sandwich was a beast and a delicious one at that. i'm a huge fan of tartine bread , best in the sf bay area especially their oat porridge , but now i'm good with the bakery. just. steer clear of the dry chocolate chunk cookie and gougere."
144,,Danny C.,1116,4.0,8/23/2017,"tartine, you are definitely growing on me. yes, it is still hipster. yes, the lines are still long. yes, a sea salt chocolate chip cookie is . you know all that and more. what you should also know is that food quality has not decreased even though prices have. croissants are still buttery, flaky, and multilayered, the bread pudding is still decadent, and sandwiches are made with fresh country bread before being pressed to perfection get the spicy turkey with broccoli rabe pesto and provolone you will thank me later . you will definitely fight for a seat and wait in line for a while, but the baked goods still rock. are the baguettes as good as keller's definitely not, but a close second."
145,,Justin W.,1116,5.0,7/24/2017,"wow, so good! but a little out of price range for regular visits on an unemployed budget. my friend and i came in for an afternoon snack, drawn in by the captivating aroma, and ended up spending + tip on two cold brew coffees and a spicy turkey sandwich. window shopping here is no good either you will definitely be tempted by literally any of the beautiful pastries at the counter. we asked for our snack to go to enjoy in dolores park, and our sandwich was cheerfully brought out about minutes later. the cold brew was fine, but in my opinion, it is kind of hard to mess up cold brew. the hefty sandwich oozed out cheese and pesto and was the perfect amount of spicy . the bread was perfectly golden, crusty, and crispy. even the carrot that came with the sandwich was unique, with a spicy and vinegary taste. definitely coming back for another snack in the future!"
146,,Jon S.,1116,5.0,4/13/2017,"pesto spicy turkey sandwich is to die for. coffee and chocolate was literally cold but it is ok. my order was all messed up still ok coz food is fuc,. amazing"
147,,Dominique G.,1116,5.0,3/15/2017,"as tourists we followed the places that had lines out the door. so glad we did! the line went by fast so do not let it stop you! for lunch we shared a spicy turkey sandwich still filling and sooo good! the lady at the counter knew we were tourists so she suggested the banana cream tart, then accidentally dropped a lemon cream tart in its box and gave that to us for free! both were amazing! i cannot tell you which was better. we sat outside and people watched while we enjoyed it all and the weather was amazing."
148,,Michelle S.,1116,2.0,9/27/2016,"the place is ok for their bread. not so sure about their dessert options or sandwiches. the chocolate eclair was dry with not enough cream inside. the banana cream tart was too sweet for my palate. overall the desserts are americanized style desserts. i should have expected this, but i think i was led to believe it would be more french style based on the name and reputation. oh well. the sandwich lacked a bit of seasoning. i got the spicy turkey and it was not spicy at all. on the plus side, the portions were huge. i waited + minutes on a saturday. i do not think i would want to repeat that experience. the bread used in the sandwich was decent though, so maybe i will come back for their baguettes."
149,,Garrett A.,1116,3.0,11/14/2015,"decent paninis. i went on a weekend and there definitely was a long line. it moved fairly efficiently and it is definitely clear this place has a reputation. i got the spicy turkey which was great. the bread was fresh and i really enjoyed the spicy kick in the brocolli pesto. and the sandwich was a very big size and a great value for the price. it is nice they have some inside and outside seating, though do not expect you will be able to sit. if you want to check this place out, plan extra time for the wait."
150,,Amy M.,1116,5.0,9/20/2015,"your mouth first meets the calculated, crisp country bread and soon arrive at the soft chewy interior that envelopes peppered turkey and a unique broccoli pesto. that is the spicy turkey . just wait in the line. it will all be worth it."
151,,Amanda W.,1116,5.0,9/19/2015,"forever a fan. lover of the company ever since purchasing one of their cookbooks years ago. do not let the line deter you. it is gone in minutes, and you can drool over the kitchen through the window, and then have ample time to read the menu and pick your pastries we have ordered the spicy turkey , jambon royale & gruyere and the three cheese tasting. all wonderful, all pricey, but all huge servings. i always have half as leftovers for my next meal. sweets wise, i highly recommend the almond rochers and the lemon cream tart. the banana creme tart and eclair are also wonderful. the lemon meringue cake, tastes good, but i'm a textures person. steer clear if you do not like cakes that have soaked up syrups creams similar to a tres leches cake. opposite of a fluffy, airy cake, very dense ."
152,,Conor M.,1116,5.0,5/24/2015," in arguably the best bakery in san francisco proper. sandwiches are amazing i'm partial to the spicy turkey , the pastries are top notch croissant, pain au chocolat, banana cream tart etc. , and the coffee is very good not great or the best, but up there enough to make this place your onestopshop for breakfast snack coffee with a pastry or treat. long lines early morning when pastries are out and fresh, and on weekends. wait can be min plus."
153,,Teresa D.,1116,4.0,8/29/2014,"we had heard how great the food was,so we tried it out and it was definitely worth the waiting in line! the spicy turkey sandwich was incredible!! the bread,so buttery and crisp, almost steals the show from the yummy pesto and melted cheeses inside! yum! sadly,the girl at the point of checkout was cold rude not just to me,but to everyone. the guys were definitely the more pleasant people on staff. even though the wait is long,the food is well worth it. the coconut cream tart was amazing,too!"
154,,Jess Y.,1116,2.0,7/21/2014,"i dislike that i am giving only stars. my sister had been here before and loves their tres leches cake. the line was long so my sister waited in line while i found parking. things looked tasty. but the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie was completely burned. the coconut macaroons were completely burned. i did not taste these or look at them until i had already left the place. burnt chocolate does not taste well whatsoever. the gal at the register has a serious attitude problem. no smile on her face and super rude. i understand you are really busy but that does not mean you can be a bitch. we also ordered a spicy turkey sandwich and two slices of tres leches cake. the cake was okay but my sister said it had a funny taste to it. it did not taste as fresh as it should have. it just did not seem like they cared. i understand that they are one out of bakeries to visit and that they have stellar reviews, but my experience just was not there."
155,,Juliana K.,1116,5.0,4/26/2014,"i cannot believe it took me so long to finally try tartine. if . stars and over reviews does not convince you to wait in line for tartine, hopefully my review will. the line is always very long for this place, usually out the door and wrapping around the corner. however, it goes by pretty fast, and it is definitely worth the wait. we decided to use the yelp highlights to guide our decisionmaking at tartine trust me, with all those mouthwatering pastries in front of you, it can be quite hard to decide what you want . as far as savory foods, i tried the spicy turkey sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe pesto. it was one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. every single ingredient was perfect, the crispy bread, the melted provolone, the spicy turkey , and the flavorful pesto. now, on to the sweet stuff we tried the morning bun, the bread pudding, and the banana creme tart yes, all the yelp highlights . they were all beyond stars, however if i had to choose my favorite, it would probably be the banana creme tart, but that is just a personal preference. if you are up for it, i would just get all of them and then walk it off later! tartine is well worth the wait, and calories! d"
156,,Nikki G.,1116,4.0,2/23/2014,"i had a lemon tart, it was so good. creamy, perfect. line took about minutes on a sunday, and i got lucky and managed to snag a table. i also had the spicy turkey pesto sandwich. got to, say, it was not as incredible as i thought it would be. the turkey did not taste as fresh as i was expecting. however, the pastry was great, i cannot wait to go back for more."
157,,Sylvia N.,1116,4.0,2/18/2014,"do not be discouraged by the long line surprisingly, it moves fairly quickly. the staff is incredibly great with getting orders in & out as fast as they can. spicy turkey & broccoli pesto sandwich just okay. unfortunately, the sandwich is pretty oily & lacks a fresh ingredient to cut through the buttery oiliness. maybe fresh tomatoes would be a good addition it comes with a pickled carrot, but i do not think it is enough. ham & cheese quiche by far, the best quiche i've ever had! love the flaky crust they use instead of the usual pie crust. i do not know if i was just unlucky but the size of the slice was a little bit on the small side. banana cream tart the banana cream tart is delicious & you can tell the ingredients are pretty fresh. but i have to say, i was a little disappointed. maybe i expected too much, but for i expected something amazing. to be honest, you might get more bang for your buck at nation's both costwise & tastewise . almond frangipane this was a unique little pastry dessert but again, nothing amazing. the service is here is just mediocre. i love that they are fast, but i do not think friendliness & great hospitality should sacrifice at the cost of quick service. overall, the desserts are unique & are pretty tasty. i love the quiche. but will i come back i'm not too sure. maybe one day, when i do not care about money & do not mind dropping big chunks of cash on teeny tiny portions of dessert."
158,,Monica P.,1116,3.0,2/2/2014,so i came here because i watched that food network special on netflix recently showcasing at as the best place to get a croissant outside of france. the bakery's tres leches cake was divine. the spicy turkey sandwich was delicious but not star flavor. there was a really nice girl helping me when i placed my order for croissants and two desserts. then i met this blonde tall guy with a total attitude behind the register. i paid . for all my food and topped it off with a small tip. he looked at it and did not even say thank you. how rude. he asked if i was staying or going and i said i wanted sandwich for here and other stuff later. i asked him about seating and he says it is hard to get. i looked around and hoovered a few minutes but it was super packed. i went back and tried to change my whole order to go. he told me i would have to hold onto my heavy table number and stick it in my bag i'm sorry but what is this guy smoking the manager was there and was thankfully like no you do not have to carry the pound table number around for mins while waiting for your sandwich. thanks. so i return in mins my sandwich is plated. ok so i play dumb and just eat it there. it was so so. i finish up and ask where my other stuff is. they say i never paid for it. really how about asking me if i paid or not instead of telling me that they do not believe me. i had to pull up my bank statement for them to even look in the system i was pissed. then they scrolled for about mins finding nothing until that other snooty guy came up and insisted in a very unfriendly way i gave you your stuff. the girl behind him who had put it away was shaking her head like no he did not. i told him look i came from la to eat here and this is just a mess. he did not even apologize and was rude again saying he was trying to fix it the manager had skedaddled and was not paying attention. overall it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. on the food network show it portrays the owners as people who are salt of the earth with real passion. i do not think that attitude transfers to their staff
159,,Maki K.,1116,4.0,1/26/2014,"if you are reading this while waiting in line, do not leave out of frustration! this place is worth the wait! there is hope. we came on a sunny saturday afternoon around pm and waited about min to get through the line. our party of shared a bunch of things. we loved the spicy turkey hot pressed sandwich delicious pesto with yummy gooey melted cheese and the turkey actually has a kick that hits you at the end. morning bun deliciously covered with cinnamon sugar on the outside. it is flaky and crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. i like the subtle hint of lemon you taste with this too. lemon poppyseed tea cake the texture is wonderful and the flavor is delicate and delicious. the outer layer has a crust that is lightly crispy with moist cake in the center. banana cream tart yum! the flaky pastry bottom has a layer of chocolate! the pretty good stuff croque monsieur not bad, but i think the spicy turkey is better. i heard you can get a fried egg on this sandwich though if you ask for it. sopressata, fontina, broccoli rabe pesto hot pressed sandwich pretty yummy, but i personally liked the spicy turkey better. mexican wedding cookies crispy texture that was not too sweet. chocolate rye cookie interesting that this is made out of rye. it was not overly sweet, which i appreciated. you could really taste the dark chocolate in this cookie. and the meh bread pudding one of my friends liked it, but i thought it was too eggy and soggy. i've had better elsewhere. the hot pressed sandwiches are huge! there are pieces that come in one order. i could only finish out of the pieces b c i wanted to save room for dessert and coffee! it will make a yummy future leftover dinner i also got an iced latte which was pretty good and balanced well with the sweets! as for seating, if you see a seat, grab it! of us stayed in line while the other person in our party went to save a seat that had opened up. would love to come back to pick up a loaf of freshly baked bread or to try some other baked goodies. my mom would love this place!"
160,,Kevin N.,1116,5.0,10/24/2018,"do yourself a favor a take a day off work and treat yo self with some delicious food from tartine. the line is totally worth it, but if you want to avoid the hassle, try to come on a weekday. the place itself is pretty small. if you have a large party, do not expect to be seated. they have a few tables inside and then three tables outside. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant. must get. morning bun sweet and delicious. the orange really comes through the whole bun and not just the outside quiche i've never had a quiche this perfect before. the egg is the perfect soft consistency sourdough take a giant loaf home. so tasty and will last you a while"
161,,Ace C.,1116,5.0,8/22/2018,"hands down the most delicious pastries i've ever had! we got the pain au jambon , morning bun, lemon tart, banana cream tart. everything was absolutely delicious and i've never had a lemon tart so perfectly balanced before. tangy and sweet, balanced by the unsweetened cream dollop on top, sitting on a flaky yet dense tart crust. i'm in love and wish i lived in sf just for this bakery! only downside is that the place is very crowded and the line can easily wrap around the building. we ended up sitting outside which was alright given the weather."
162,,Wendy R.,1116,4.0,7/28/2018,"we finally made it to tartine. i had expected the experience to be more intimidating and the cafe to be larger wrong on both accounts. we got there a few minutes after opening on a saturday and waited about minutes in line. i've seen a lot of people complain about the long lines, so i'm not sure if we got lucky or if those people are just impatient. we both got a morning bun and a pain au jambon . both were delicious, and now i know what the description shatteringly crisp means. i also got a fresh grapefruit juice, which was probably the best i've ever had. i could not finish the croissant, but i powered through the bun. the cafe is tiny, and the prices are a bit steep, but i would say it is definitely worth a trip."
163,,Winnie Y.,1116,4.0,5/15/2018,"tartine bakery is another one of those places in sf with the lines wrapped around the block. i commend tartine for moving the line along fairly quickly and having copies of the menu available for people to look at so that they are ready to order once they are at the front. no extra charge for the carryout paper bag. lemon cream tart '' bold lemon flavor but excessively sweet make sure to spread the whipped cream over the entire tart because it will help balance out the sugary filling. possibly meant to shared between people. frangipane croissant almond cream tartine is quite generous with the cream, and they do a great job of spreading the cream evenly throughout the pastry instead of just putting a little smear at the center. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant excellent breakfast choice that was actually pretty big and filled me up. the saltiness from the ham and cheese was a little overpowering after a while, but it was still yummy! pain au chocolat chocolate croissant fairly plain with a touch of bittersweet chocolate, which showed off the flakiness of the crisp, buttery croissant. great choice if you are looking for something on the lighter and simpler side."
164,,Julia M.,1116,5.0,4/19/2018,this review is for the pain au jambon with jalapeno. i came here for a snack with a friend i would heard too much about this place to pass it by. the line was intimidating but it ended up only taking us about min to get to the front ~ pm on a saturday . the pastry was absolutely amazing. i highly recommend getting something to go and eating out at dolores park if the weather is nice.
165,,Kathryn T.,1116,4.0,3/27/2018,"i happened to be up early on a monday and found myself in the mission district of sf. i heard about tartine before, so i decided to stop by with my boyfriend. we were lucky, the line was super short when we arrived! i guess normally the line is way longer, and it did get longer after we already got our pastries. i would recommend looking at the menu or more at yelp before you get to the front of the line, it is hard to see everything because the line kind of gets in the way. we ended up ordering the pain au jambon , frangipane croissant, and morning bun. i loved the morning bun, it was soft, sweet & citrusy, and so tasty! my boyfriend enjoyed the pain au jambon , the ham was super delicious. the frangipane croissant was good too, not too sweet. the outer croissant was a little hard, but the inside was soft, creamy, and almondy! this was a really nice bakery, i would stop by here again for a morning bun next time i'm in the area! and have some time to kill in a line."
166,,A P.,1116,4.0,3/23/2018,"we landed here at about am on a saturday to a nontrivial line out onto the sidewalk that only got longer with time. we ended up purchasing a great variety of pastry, including a slice of ham and leek quiche, frangipane croissant, morning bun, pain au jambon hamandcheese croissant , gougere onion and cheese pastry , lemon cream tart, and banana cream tart per the many, many recommendations here . may have gotten a few more pastries i cannot recall. this was definitely not a cheap excursion. these pastries ran us north of , tax included. that said, most everything was good, and several were great. the gougere was a surprise hit, flaky, pungent with onion but not overpowering, and probably a good bet for vegetarians sorry vegans, i think they contain cheese . the quiche and hamandcheese croissant were both very solid. as i expected from reading the many reviews here, the banana cream tart was far and away the star of the show. deliciously pudding custardy texture not too sweet or too bland, but exactly right. i noticed they have full piesized banana cream tarts as well something to explore later, i think. sadly, the lemon tart was the biggest miss. bland and did not really have much lemon flavor. give it a pass. i did not find all pastries to be uniformly amazing, the prices were steep, and nobody enjoys waiting in line. if it were not for those issues, this place would have gotten stars from me. also, since this is the mission, there is no parking to be had either. i will probably be back sometime in future, but unless you are a local with time to kill standing around in line without having to worry about parking, this is not an everyday visit kind of place."
167,,Corinna T.,1116,4.0,2/16/2018," . stars the pastries are truly exceptional and above average here, and they know it! the line is always out the door, and i've never tried to stand in it until last weekend. i will definitely be back if i'm in the neighborhood. i tried pain au jambon a large, flakey croissant with applewood smoked ham and gruvere cheese croque monsieur turkey a warm and buttery sandwich with turkey and cheese both were delicious! and shareable i loved the warm texture of the croque monsieur, and the pain au jambon , the croissant was so unique and different than anything i've ever tried. i want to come back and try the banana cream tart and morning bun everyone talks about!"

169,,Mary P.,1116,3.0,1/3/2018,"i had wanted to visit this bakery in a previous visit to san francisco, but timing just never lined up. i'm a sucker for high end french pastries, and these made my mouth water looking at them online. unfortunately, because of the location, i could not get to the bakery until later in the day, so options were limited. what we did and could get was delicious, but i would definitely want to do this in the morning if i were to go again. i managed to get rochers which were these meringue clouds with cacao nibs yum. i also got a pain au jambon and pain au chocolate, one of the better croissants i've had in a long time. perfect, airy, buttery, just the way they should be a for those alone. there were quite a few sketchy characters in the bakery when we visited around pm, and having to almost climb over a homeless man who decided to camp out in the middle of the bakery was a bit of a buzz kill. we took our pastries to go, and had them back at the hotel. i was actually hoping to sit down and relax at the bakery and enjoy our pastries, oh well."
170,,Bradford L.,1116,3.0,12/23/2017,"for the price i'm paying and the minute wait, i expected a bit more. we ordered the pain au jambon , lemon cream tart, and chocolate hazelnut tart. pain au jambon pretty good, but expensive and not special lemon cream tart probably my favorite, but it could be considered pretty tart to others chocolate hazelnut tart rather disappointing, it was bland and surprisingly, did not have much chocolate flavor i might try this place again if there was not such a long wait, but most likely, i will be looking elsewhere to fill my pastry needs."
171,,Vanessa M.,1116,4.0,9/25/2017,"when i knew i was going to visit my gf in sf, i yelped around for bakeries, and remember there was a popular french bakery that was raved about in sf. i yelped around and right knew it had to be tartine since it had over , reviews. and yes the pictures were just the type of patisserie i was looking for. i was worried at first because i knew there would be a long crazy line but luckily when we went it was not that bad. i liked the atmosphere, small, but cozy and quaint. simple and clean. i was overwhelmed because everything looked so good and i wanted it all! i came here twice since first time they were out of a few things and i wanted to come earlier and really get the full experience. _frangipane tart . flaky pastry she will, almond cream with seasonal fruit. this was the first thing i got when i came here, even though my heart wanted the banana cream tart. it looked good, but taste wise was a let down. it tasted average, and a bit try. not as flaky or buttery and did not have much flavor besides just almond. the fruit was i believe some type of berry. maybe blueberry or boysenberry, which was not that sweet and the flavors did not really come through. for the price, this was not worth it at all. _banana cream tart . chocolate and caramel coated flaky pastry. because i was disappointed with the tart above, i decided to just follow my heart and go for the banana cream tart. it was huge so i originally was afraid to eat it all by myself, since my gf cannot have too much sweets, but i'm on vacay so f it! so glad i ended up getting this, because it was the best banana cream tart i've had. actually i never had a banana cream tart, just pie. the crust is more buttery, flaky and thickthe bananas were fresh, and they added a good amount. the cream was a good ration and not too sweet. the caramel inside was subtle and not too sweet but balanced the other flavors. the chocolate inside seemed dark and rich. now this is worth the price! the chocolate shavings were amazing as well. a must! _pain au chocolate chocolate croissant i came back second day for this but took this home with me back to la. i put it in the toaster oven and it was still good. this is a double chocolate croissant, so more chocolate. the chocolate seemed semi dark and a bit more rich and bold than milk chocolate. it was good, but chocolate croissant you can get anywhere, this is good if you just want that sweet pastry. _morning bun . cinnamon sugar, candied orange. a man in front of me said i had to get this, and i'm so glad i did. this was my other fave and a must! it tasted like a cinnamon roll, from the sugar and cinnamon, but definitely not as sweet. it had a candied orange flavor and paste, that was not too much but just enough to give that orange flavor. it brought out more of the cinnamon flavor. and the bread itself was so flaky, buttery and soft. i wish i got two of this because this is something i've never had before. _pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant . smoked ham, gruyere. had this as well back home, popped it in the toasted over. the ham was slightly salty and the cheese was not as gooey but i'm sure it would have tasted way better when i ate it fresh that day. again the croissant was butter and the layers were just crisp throughout. i also love how the croissants are very thick and huge. this pretty much touched the top toasted oven. _tea cake loaf . lemon almond. i had this back at home two days later, and it was still good! the loaf was still very moist, but it seemed more on the buttery side. the edges had a nice lemon flavor and more on the sweeter side. this would have been good with some tea. _quiche slice . ham, seasonal vegetable. this was pretty good! and i only like quiche at proof bakery back home, but this was pretty darn close. i find the crust important on quiche, and the one here was buttery and fresh. the ham and veggies were good, although i find it a saltier than what i prefer, but it was filling and perfect for a savory and quick brunch. overall everything was great, but i find the prices pretty high. i would definitely come back here again, and i would say it is worth the wait, but be prepared to spend some for a few pastries."
172,,Malek A.,1116,5.0,7/29/2017,"the food is amazing. we tried the croque monsieur, pain au jambon , pain au chocola and bread pudding and they were all perfect. drinks were good as well. the best part about the food is that it was all freshly baked. besides the food, there is a long waiting line, the design of the place is outdated and the art is very random but who cares as long as the food is great! oh, i almost forgot, the staff was very nice!!"
173,,Hayley B.,1116,4.0,3/11/2017,"do not let the line scare you this place is worth the wait! i ordered the pain au jambon ham and gruyere croissant , had a bite of my friend's ham and leek quiche, and the frangipane tart almond and seasonal fruit . we also ordered lattes that were delicious and came in some adorable glassware. all of the food was delicious, and there were so many wonderful treats to try it was very hard to choose, which means a return trip will be necessary. because it can be so crowded, it might be difficult to eat on site. we did, but it was a little bit cramped and not all patrons are good about following the instructions to clear their plates when they are done eating. you might consider getting your treats to go and walking over to dolores park to enjoy them in some wide open spaces. enjoy!"
174,,Tiffany C.,1116,5.0,2/19/2017,"i think i've tried almost everything at this bakery.but really lol. not the greatest place to meet a large group as you have to find seating which is pretty challenging as most people are also trying to catch up with friends family over delicious pastries as well. all of tartine's baked goods have this crust on them and for people who love crunchy food like me, this is your dream come true. items i've tried croissant pretty good but not the best i've ever had almost croissant the filling is amazing and not too overpowering pain au chocolat make sure to get this when it is warm!! pain au jambon really tasty the perfect afternoon snack these are really messy so have lots of napkins on standby morning bun this is one of their more popular items and it is delicious and a little different because of the orange zest but not my favorite item here brioche bread pudding super underrated. i would recommend getting this for anyone who hates bread pudding because this will change your mind tea cake lemon poppyseed really moist and gf too croque monsieur cheese and ham i mean common who would not love this banana cream tart really messy and flaky. i would not recommend but they do have this massive one that could be fun to take to parties lemon cream tart this this this always order this. the most delicate lemon flavor and smoothest cream just ugh so good chocolate hazelnut tart this is a little dry and i was not too happy with this treat in all, tartine is amazing. i will be coming back and visiting the upcoming la location as well d"
175,,Lorena S.,1116,4.0,12/20/2016,came here for a snack while we walked to see the local murals. there was a pretty long line but it moved rather quickly. i ordered a regular croissant and a pain au jambon . it is funny because i realized it was a ham and cheese croissant but ordered it as they had it labeled. when they ringed me up they said regular and ham and cheese croissant. i was concerned because the croissant looked burnt but i took a bite and it was the perfect combo of hard and soft. the outside had this great hard and flaky crust while the inside was super soft. it made it more of a sandwhich then bakery item which is what i was going for. the place was really small and packed. i would suggest that any non locals get their items to go and enjoy the rest of the mission district which is packed with beautiful and powerful murals.
176,,Kristina G.,1116,5.0,12/4/2016,"when we first passed by tartine we almost gave up because the line out front was so long, but good thing we decided to try it out anyway! their pastries are so good that it is unexplainable!! we had to go the next day again! so, we tried pain au jambon which is a savory croissant with ham and cheese, savory scone, croque monsieur and then coconut cream tart and banana cream tart which tasted like they are out of this world!!! i totaly recommend coming here, you will never forget it! waiting in line for minutes does not bother you at all when you know you will try the best food ever!"
177,,Sherry Y.,1116,5.0,11/13/2016," late review aug weekend afternoon] came into the mission district to soak up some sun and delores park, and we decided to check out tartine to grab some baked goodies. boy oh boy was the line long. it took us about minutes to reach the counter, but all the memories of waiting went out the window when we saw all the items displayed. the first items we saw were the desserts and cakes what a way to start the day! without much background information on the bakery i know, smart move to wait in line and not know what to expect i was open to almost everything that i saw, and i had to tell myself times that i could not afford to buy everything nor did i have the stomach capacity to eat everything. sad life. i ended up grabing a small coconut creme tart, and croissants a regular, chocolate, and i believe it was the pain au jambon smoked ham + gruyere . there was no way i could finish all of these, even as someone who can eat a lot. the croissants are pretty huge, and even after eating the coconut creme tart i could barely eat the other croissants to compare my friends each could only eat or . pastries . the tart was out of this world, i would get this a second, third, xth time! i believe the banana creme tart was the hype of the tarts at tartine, but i'm not much of a banana creme tart fan. if it is as magical as the coconut creme tart go for it! as other reviewers have mentioned, the croissants are a good size.maybe half the size of my face my face is not the smallest. i almost gave the place a because of the line which really could not be helped , and the service the staff members were informative but hard to catch as they tried to get the line going i can understand having worked in the food industry, but being skipped over a few times was not a fun expeience . the staff were overall very efficient and quick on their feet, and having to work in such a hectic situation of hangry people does not make things easier, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed for a better next experience here at a notsobusy time good luck to that ."
178,,Karen N.,1116,5.0,7/22/2016,"my friend told me that we have to stop by here. so, of course, we did! we stopped by around on a monday and we only waited in line for about minutes. we ordered the croissant, hazelnut biscotti, bavarian, and the pain au jambon . bavarian was delicious very light and not overly sweet. since we were traveling, we saved the others for the morning when we were traveling home. and honestly, they were not stale nor bad. they were all so great. this place definitely lives up to the hype. we took our order to go. the place is a bit small so if you have a large stroller is difficult to navigate around inside. it was all worth it and i cannot wait to come back to try more!"
179,,Trisha R.,1116,4.0,5/1/2016,"i think sometimes we get caught up in the heat of the moment and the hype of something. we stood in line for the expected long wait time. i think from beginning to the end when we ordered was a total of minutes. i thought since we were there we would live it up and order a couple different things. we both ordered their famous morning bun. it was pretty so that is nice. first bite was lite and airy and not so sickly sweet as you would expect from a typical cinnamon roll bakery item. but the second bite lent itself to a hint of citrus that became less hinting and more prominent after each bite. i'm not saying it was not good i just personally do not care for that so much. but it was fairly inexpensive . each which seems reasonable even if you do not care for it. my husband loves bread pudding so we ordered a small bowl of their brioche bread pudding that came with some fresh strawberries on top and kind of mixed in . . that also was light which is nice. i would have to say i definitely prefer strawberries in my bread pudding instead of raisins that is for sure. but brioche bread is sweet to begin with so it was more on the sweet side. if i did not have the morning bun as well i could probably have eaten more. i'm obsessed with having to have some kind of egg dish for something to be considered breakfast so i ordered a slice of the vegetable quiche. i really liked the filling, once again it was light and fluffy. the french have a way at keeping things light. i did not care for the crust. it was burnt in my opinion and did not leave a nice flavor in my mouth. my husband said my quiche were better love him forever and i kinda have to agree. the last thing we ordered was the pain au jambon w jalapeno which they say they only make it that way on the weekend . . it was by far the best of everything we ordered. they should make it on the weekday as well. the ham was a nice thickness and the gruyere cheese flavor was there but not over powering. they use a fresh jalapeno and do not remove the seeds so beware. my last bite was a bit spicy. but super yummy. our total for items came to . . kinda pricey considering it was just baked goods and we could have had eggs benedict and omelettes for the same price. overall, we can say we have been to this tartine place but i'm not going to rush back anytime soon. it was good, prices were reasonable, but not waiting in line + minutes for good. you have to at least go once to say you have been."
180,,Acilegna T.,1116,1.0,11/4/2018,"what a tourist trap. after living in san francisco for my entire life, everyone told me to try tartine bakery. wow was i disappointed. this place is not worth the minutes i stood in line. no one writes down what you want, so if you are ordering more than pastries, get ready to have your order wrong when you get to the front. i think the girl that rang me up was fighting with the girl taking the orders up at the line because i got most of the attitude directed at her. not worth the hype or the money. ordered butter croissants pain au chocolat eclairs lemon tart i said thank you after the order and the girl ringing me up just stared off into space and ignored me. maybe she was having a bad day, but that was enough for me never want to come back."
181,,John L.,1116,5.0,11/2/2018,"candied orange and cinnamon sugar they are not as common a combination as peanut butter and jelly, thunder and lightning, or russell westbrook and poor fg percentage, but tartine bakery and cafe surely did their homework to roll them up into the finest morning bun ever. dipped in even more sugar, it was surprisingly not as sweet as it looked. it is flaky, buttery, and cinnamony, much like a cross between a croissant and a cinnamon roll in full swing! the morning bun alone is reason enough to come back, but the croque monsieur with shiitake mushroom will make the decision even easier. simply put, a croque monsieur is a ham and cheese sandwich but a lot better. their offering came with a choice of ham, turkey, shiitake mushroom, or fromage blanc. our order came nicely baked with plenty of mushrooms and melted gruyere cheese. my younger daughter enjoyed it so much that she wanted a single slice to be her next birthday cake. we just need to buy some candles! we also tried the huge gougere savory choux pastry with gruyere cheese and the largerthanusual pain au chocolat chocolate croissant . they were also delicious, but not as impressive as the other two items we had. the quiche, scone, croissant , cookie, tart, and cake looked appetizing as well, but we would have gone home broke had we decided to try them all. the wait was long and the prices were steep, but the quality and taste of the food were superior. seating oneself could be a challenge, but mission dolores park is just a couple of blocks away. enjoy the stroll while slowly nibbling away at that delightful morning bun."
182,,Nari H.,1116,4.0,10/30/2018,"came on a saturday in october around pm and waited at most minutes, unlike those who went in the morning and waited over mins. the line moved pretty fast given it is a small space and the line went out the door. here's what i got country bread loaf solid bread loaf, especially when it is just out of the oven. you will find a thicker heartier crust, and a dense inside. flavor is good, but on the mineraly side for me. it lasted for a few days after too. morning bun ish this is like a kouignamann got married to a cinnamon role and had a gigantic baby with a little bit of almondflavor pastelike filling. overall, very good, although not as memorable as the kouignamann from dominique's in nyc. pain au chocolate also ish. this was huge. probably the biggest chocolate croissant i've ever had, and really good. worth it for me, but wished there was a little more chocolate on the inside. i would get this again. goat cheese sandwich came with apple slices, and overall good, but would probably try something different. did not get the other things recommended since i was on the road and on the go, but i would definitely try to come back next time to try other things they offer here that others have raved about. until next time!"
183,,Megan H.,1116,5.0,10/30/2018,"so i would just had dinner and was on my way to dessert, but i had to stop by tartine bakery because it is a san francsico staple and i am not in the mission district often. i could not get any of the more extravagant desserts, but next time i am getting that coconut cream tart! cookies, croissants , pies, i could not decide. the guy behind the counter suggested the morning bun because it is their most popular item, so i went with that. morning bun . this is like a cinnamon roll in the way the bread has layers, but like a croissant in the way the bread pulls apart. it is flavored with cinnamon sugar and candied orange and is on the sweeter side. it took me a couple days to eat it. i really liked the crunch of the sugar granules covering the bun. i think the orange flavor complemented the cinnamon well. there was a line, but it moved fast, and the service was friendly. it is pricey, but worth it."
184,,Harry X.,1116,3.0,10/28/2018,"good, but overhyped in my opinion. tried a regular croissant and the coconut cream tart. the croissant was massive but pretty bland. i could barely taste any butteriness which sort of defeats the point of a croissant in comparison, arsicault bakery seems to do them much better. the coconut cream tart was delicious but came in at over after tax, which is more expensive than a super suiza quesadilla at el farolito basically this dessert costs more than a hearty meal in the same neighborhood . may come back later to try some of their other offerings, but not quite sure about the hype after my first visit."
185,,Rebecca O.,1116,5.0,10/24/2018,"holy mother. tartine takes the prize for the best pastries and baked goods i have ever had. we went twice while in sf both at off hours early morning and afternoon and only had to wait minutes. we tried a whole host of pastries, but my favorite was the morning bun. the croissant was the most incredible croissant ever. if you have the chance, go!"
186,,Kevin N.,1116,5.0,10/24/2018,"do yourself a favor a take a day off work and treat yo self with some delicious food from tartine. the line is totally worth it, but if you want to avoid the hassle, try to come on a weekday. the place itself is pretty small. if you have a large party, do not expect to be seated. they have a few tables inside and then three tables outside. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant . must get. morning bun sweet and delicious. the orange really comes through the whole bun and not just the outside quiche i've never had a quiche this perfect before. the egg is the perfect soft consistency sourdough take a giant loaf home. so tasty and will last you a while"
187,,Mary X.,1116,4.0,10/22/2018,"pretty long waits throughout the day, but you have to try the banana cream tart. it was the best i've had mission pie comes very close . the crust is phenomenal and there is a caramelized flavor to it that makes it that much better. the croissants are huge and the lamination on them are pretty spot on. i personally thought the croissant was too crunchy though, was looking for a bit of fluff in the middle. morning bun was also very flaky and firm. i do not really eat morning buns though so i do not know how they should taste. the chocolate chip walnut cookie is big but very flat and super crispy. i enjoyed it, despite know all that extra butter is probably the secret to the nice crunch it has. would come back to try their lemon meringue cake and other cream tarts!"
188,,Mel L.,1116,5.0,10/21/2018,"tartine delivers the tastiest pastries and other baked goods so consistently. there is almost always a line but it tends to go quickly and it is always worth the wait. they are known for many things but the banana tart is one of the most well known. both the banana tart and the coconut cream are both very good, creamy with a flaky crust. the morning bun, almond croissant and the ham and cheese croissant are among my favorites and i have to get those every time. coffee is great too. the shop is small but i was fortunate enough to snag table seats the last two times i've visited. if you find yourself in the mission, stopping by tartine is a must."
189,,Christopher L.,1116,5.0,10/21/2018,"omg do not get me started on tartine. i've been here at least times so far and have been coming at least twice a month since i've moved here it is rare that i go anywhere more than once . it also does not help that i live a block away from this delightful, delicious bakery. the pastries they make here are probably the best i've ever had in the city. i would say my favorite are the almond croissant and the banana cream tart. i've also tried the regular croissant , chocolate croissant , ham and cheese croissant , morning bun, buttermilk scone, lemon meringue cake, ham and egg quiche and the croque monsieur with ham. so i will speak about the croissants in general. the croissants they create here are huge, you might think that is crazy for a croissant but i've paid for croissants that are half the size. here, they are super sized and can be a meal in itself! the croissants have a dry, crunchy surface that breaks super easily, but a warm, cozy, fluffy inside that almost melts in your mouth. their croissants here are so good and you would be fine choosing any croissant . the banana cream tart is even more filling, it really satisfies the craving for any sweet tooths out there. it comes with banana, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate flakes and a whole bunch of other goodness. one of the best tarts i've ever had. all the other things i've tried all of them are pretty solid. things that were pretty average were the morning bun and their scones, but still pretty decent. honestly, you cannot go wrong here! when in doubt, any of the things first listed in it is section is pretty solid. also prepare to wait here! unless you come really early. there is often a line that can take anywhere from minutes before when you line up and when you pay for your order. also do not come too late because they usually run out of the best things early on."
190,,Carmen N.,1116,5.0,10/16/2018,"the best croissant ever! nice and flaky, not to buttery. we also got the chocolate eclair. my son loved it so much we bought another one to take out. the match latte and coffee were on the weak side. would definitely come back for the pastry but would skip the drinks."
191,,Jennifer C.,1116,5.0,10/16/2018,we loved the morning bun! it was crispy and had a hint of citrus. the banana cream tart had real banana slices and was not too overwhelming in banana flavor. the crust had chocolate and caramel. the chocolate croissant was fluffy and so good!
192,,Molly M.,1116,5.0,10/12/2018,"tartine was one of our first stops on our trip to san francisco. after wandering the mission, we stopped by to grab some goodies before heading to enjoy them at dolores park. at , the line was out the door but still better than i expected! we waited for about minutes before getting to the front, where we ordered a croissant and a morning bun. both were enormous the croissant was deliciously buttery with a crisp flakey crust, and soft layers upon layers of delicate dough on the inside, with an appreciably nice chew. it was so good, i ruined my appetite for dinner! we ended up saving the morning bun and it was still good the next day sweet, with a hint of citrus zest. we saw loaves of sourdough coming out of the oven at this time, so if you want the freshest bread, get here around !"
193,,Maria U.,1116,5.0,10/10/2018,"i'm in love with this bakery, this place has my heart. everything about this place is great. the food, the customer service, and overall experience is amazing. this place does fill up quick so make sure you have a plan b if you cannot find seating inside. a lot of people do grab their treats and head out. when you first come in you see a large display counter on the left hand side, a register and drink bar towards the back and a seating area to the right. i would not recommend coming here with a large group of people unless it is during a less frequently visited time. when i went there with my coworker, we got a guyere & has croissant . a lemon tart and a frangipane tart with a couple of coffees. on my gosh, there is really no other way to say but this place is amazing!! the flaky croissant was out of this world. it had a delicious buttery taste to it with the right amount of crunch. the lemon tart was also absolutely genius. the lemon filling was perfectly made! the frangipane tart made me so happy, mary berry would be proud. the bottom was not crumbly or overly sweet. it was just right. im so sad in leaving san francisco next week because i want to come back here every single day. trust me you all, this is a bakery you want to visit if you are in town. you will not be disappointed!"
194,,Jang N.,1116,5.0,10/10/2018,the best bakery i have ever been to! it is the closest thing to bakeries i've had in france. i'm a huge fan of eclairs and they have the best eclairs i have ever tasted. i'm also a huge fan of croissants and they also had the best croissants . their morning bun is as good as advertised! their pies are also really good and their quiches are decent i'm usually do not like quiches . make sure you try the banana cream tart. super sweet but super delish! do not let the long lines fool ya it goes by pretty quickly
195,,LAIKA K.,1116,5.0,10/2/2018,"you literally cannot go wrong here. everything is delicious! the great, croissants , the cakes and the bread pudding!"
196,,Laura K.,1116,5.0,9/28/2018,"there is only one word needed to describe the first bite of their morning bun happiness. balancing the crisp exterior of a croissant with the doughy inside of a cinnamon bun, and just a hint of sunny citrus, it is a joy to eat. especially when you are lucky enough to get there as they are pulling a pan warm from the oven. it is a san francisco musteat. their country bread is equally top notch crackly crumb, sexy, large air pockets and just the right amount of hearty chewiness. take note that the loaves are huge, so if you manage not to eat the entire thing, they freeze well sliced."
197,,Angela L.,1116,4.0,9/27/2018,"this place has very, very good pastries, and def worth a visit, however, it did fall short of the hype for me. although the croissant and pain au chocolat were quite good although a bit burned on one side , they were not any better than several other pastry shops i have visited. that being said, they were very delicious, very buttery and flakey, and most importantly, not skimping on the chocolate. my big recommendation is the morning bun, which is outofthis world good. like really really good. most likely the best pastry i've ever had. and that is saying something considering that i took this one to go and ate it the next day. one day old and still the best, that is how good it was! this was the one thing i tried that did in fact live up to the hype! i would def come back here and encourage others to as well! but i would recommend skipping straight to the morning bun and def not get the savory scones really really dry. scones are naturally drier i know, but these made my mouth and throat feel like a desert, no joke! . do expect a long wait and a few extra minutes to find parking, but it is worth it if you order it right thing "
198,,Anina M.,1116,5.0,9/26/2018,came here before catching my flight. i heard a lot of good things about it so i had to go and try for myself. this place is definitely a sweets spot. had the almond croissant and it was almost as good as the ones i had in paris. also ordered a lemon tarte if you tart and lemon get it. if not i suggest getting something else. me and my friend also ordered a latte and a cappuccino.
199,,Melissa D.,1116,4.0,9/25/2018,great croissants and absolutely glorious bread!!! some of the pastries are subpar but i understand i may not have a sophisticated pallet. i do love hot cheetos and a wide array trashy food. i will always return here though for a loaf of country bread for home. jesus lord the bread is amazing! lovely staff. great spot even though at times there is a long line.
200,,Fanny W.,1120,5.0,11/7/2018,"found myself here again for another sponsored pharma dinner. in short, gary danko delivers perfection when it comes to service and execution. what i ordered + glazed oysters, + lemon pepper duck breast , + baked chocolate souffle, glazed oysters w caviar delicious duh! . wanted to try the risotto but i love me some oysters. love how it is slightly cooked but still maintains the texture of a raw oyster. duck breast phenomenal. tender and a perfect mediumrare. generous portions paired with a nice duck hash and puree. baked souffle fluffy. i've had several souffles in the past and was never really a fan. but wow! i loved my souffle, ate it all without the two sauces. not overly sweet, fluffy all around with a moist mushy center. i guess i do like souffles but only at gary danko."
201,,Faye M.,1120,5.0,10/24/2018,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast . although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
202,,Katy W.,1120,5.0,10/19/2018,"tl dr do not hesitate. book the reservation. it is the most bang for your buck michelin star experience you will get. the service is amazing and the food is even better. do it. and then read reviews to figure out what dishes you want. seriously, one of my favorite dining experiences ever. worth every penny you spend here and more!!! we came here for our joint th birthdays. after much thought, we decided that gd has been one of our top dining experiences and that there was no better place to spend our birthdays. we each ordered the course dinner. salt cured foie gras torchon with peach compote his the lesser of the two foie dishes, but still delicious. i wish there was more bread for the foie, but that is our only gripe with this dish. seared foie gras with caramelized onions & black mission figs mine oh my god. get this. the onions, foie, and figs pair perfectly for an explosion in your mouth. would get again. roasted sea scallops mine i got this dish last time, and got it again this time. it never disappoints and is always delicious. the cook on the scallop is perfect and it is tender and juicy. roast maine lobster his if i was not mildly allergic to lobster, this would have been my dish. the components of this dish really seal the deal. the lobster was cooked well and not gummy. seared filet his probably our least favorite dish of the evening, but even then, it is something we enjoyed. the cook medium rare was great and the basil butter excellent. pan seared bass mine i ordered this even though i'm not a fan of bell peppers or capers.but seriously, i am so impressed. i cleared my plate and finished it all. impressive especially if you know me and know that i will pick the tiniest piece of bell pepper out of any dish. lemon pepper duck breast mine i will admit that by this course, i was feeling fully stuffed and needed to save room for dessert. so i took a taste and asked them to box it up for me. even as my lunch the next day.it was delicious. best lunch ever. note gd's duck has been my favorite dish out of any duck dish i've had.even internationally. do not miss out. trio of creme brulee mine my favorite dessert is creme brulee. if it is on the menu, i will get it. three of them sold. the flavors this time were vanilla, bourbon, and ginger. the vanilla was wonderful cannot ever go wrong with the og. the bourbon was to die for. it tasted like caramel and flan it was just the right amount of gooey and melt in your mouth. it was super sweet though. the ginger one was the only one that was slightly disappointing. it had a little too much bite and was overpowering. i love the take home cake they send you with. they used to only give it to the women in the dining party, but this time they gave us two!!!! mmmm mmm mm pineapple cake for breakfast the next morning. not going to lie, the take home cake plays a huge role in my decision to come back to gd. service is impeccable but that is exactly what you should expect from somewhere as old school as gd. the last time we came, i was in a soft cast for my foot and they were super accommodating with my temporary handicap. this time, one of our entrees took a little longer than they expected. we did not mind since we understand that saturday nights are busy. but they comped a glass for wine for me and a glass of fancy merlot grape juice for my boyfriend. i cannot wait to come back here again it is still one of my our favorite dining experiences meals. goal try every menu item and every cheese on the cheese cart."
203,,Sophie W.,1120,4.0,10/3/2018,"back when i was a poor little college student, i remember always seeing gary danko pop up through a search of most reviewed restaurants in san francisco. now i'm still poor but have a much more hedonistic attitude towards the places i eat, which is what led me to make a reservation months in advance at gary danko for my friend's and my birthday dinner. gary danko is very classy old sf, from the suited up waiters to the candlelit booths. plus the windows are totally blacked out, so it feels like you are dining at midnight. the tables are pretty far apart so you have to really lean to have a conversation. our waiter had an incredibly calming voice and pulled out the table so we could squeeze into our seats tables are pretty close together . despite all this, the highlight of the service was the sourdough bread boy. he really kept  them coming with the refills of bread, and every time i finished my two slices, he would reappear like a genie and plunk two more pillowy slices of bread onto my plate with his tongs. we went for the choices from the menu and went crazy on the meat. we said screw it to the appetizers and ordered the stuffed quail, bison, lemon pepper duck , sea bass, lobster, and chocolate souffle. in order of favorites, mine were stuffed quail so much flavor crammed into this little bird lemon pepper duck super tender and came with a little potato cake of crispy potatoes and more duck bison this thing was huge. we were worried we would not be full, but along comes this plate of slabs of bison meat and some fat mushrooms. if you are worried you will not be full off courses, order the bison. lobster super buttery, but the showstopper was the mashed potatoes. they were so creamy and specked with corn sea bass undercooked. do not order. the chocolate souffle belongs in a whole other category. i'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but oh man with the vanilla and chocolate sauce soaked into a pillowy interior, this souffle was incredible. we also got a lemon mousse cake for our birthdays, and a plate of sweets that they always deliver at the end of the meal. the pineapple cake they give you as a going away gift is perfect with tea or coffee for breakfast the next day!"
204,,Astrid V.,1120,4.0,9/24/2018,"may have had too high of expectations for this place. sweet corn soup which was very flavorfulnice start to everything. seared ahi tuna dish would have been amazing if the tuna was up to par. the avocado and lemon dressing were very complimentary. they do not skimp on the avocado either sea scallops were small and not very exciting flavor wise. horseradish salmon was great! the cucumbers and mustard sauce were perfectly proportioned to enhance the salmon. i wish i would have ordered . lemon pepper duck was not anything to rave about and the filet was pretty standardbut appreciated the touch of swiss chard. peanut butter bar with dark chocolate was way more rich than i thought so have a pitcher of water ready. baked chocolate souffle was more savory than sweet but very very good. was sent home with the most adorable upside down pineapple cakes which were perfect with coffee the next morning. moist and flavorful but small enough you do not feel guilty. who am i kidding i never feel guilty about sweets. all in all, the service was outstanding!!!!"
205,,Diane L.,1120,3.0,8/21/2018,"i've had this restaurant on my bucketlist for the longest time. went this past sunday since my friend wanted to treat so i could not pass that up. our reservation was for pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. a little behind turned into being a minute wait. the manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. that was a nice gesture, but what would have been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. just my preference vs the free champagne small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons of soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing it was ok. i really wanted to fall in love with this place but it is overhyped for sure. my favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops, seared foie gras, dungeoness crab salad, and all the desserts flambeed cheeries with tres leches cake, lemon souflee cake, and the pineapple cake they give you to take home . the filet of beef was meh the sides on there tasted better and the lemon pepper duck was ok as well, what the heck gary danko maybe my expectations were too high. also, the seared ahi tuna had wayyy too much lemon soy dressing on there. i'm kinda glad i did not have to pay for this meal i did not think it was that worth it to me. such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner i was thinking that i would rather go to house of prime rib lol. overall, i did not come super hungry, but i thought the portions are a little small for my liking. nice presentation and service here, but i think this was just a one time thing for me. for example, it is like seeing someone hot. you just want to hit it and quit it. so basically aka being able to say you went to gary danko to eat just to say you did it."
206,,Sherry L.,1120,5.0,7/24/2018,"gary danko was definitely an experience and well worth your money! i love the fact that you can choose whatever you want on the menu based on how many courses you chose. my boyfriend chose a course and i chose a course and you can pick all entrees, all appetizers, all desserts if you choose, nobody will judge you . so what we did was order basically of whatever we wanted to try and shared it! we ordered foi gras risotto pan seared bass seared sea scallops herb crusted lamb lemon pepper duck pork tenderloin juniper crusted bison chocolate souffet if i were to rank my top favorite of the course it would be . seared sea scallops probably the best scallops i've ever had! i could not stop thinking about it even when we left foi gras very tasty a good idea would to put it on the bread that they provided for you we actually would have done that if we knew, we only know after we finished the foi gras but heard the table next to us do it! . lemon pepper duck the duck was tender and tasty, definitely recommended! if i were to rank my top that i did not like it would be . juniper crusted bison this was waaay too tough for me so i did not like it and tasted a bit bland. . pork tenderlion this was actually really tender but i thought it was too bland. . risotto i thought their risotto was just ok. after our meal, they gave us a mini plate of small assorted desserts and goodies to take home! this place left such a great impression that i would go again."
207,,Andrew C.,1120,4.0,5/24/2018,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "
208,,Rod M.,1120,5.0,4/5/2018,"what can i add to a place that has almost thousand reviews an essay that is what ! give my profile a follow if you like my reviews and or lists. . in the nickel n dime east bay i was born and raised on the san fran streets is now where i spend most of my days chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool rollin in my whip sometimes uber pool when a couple of yelpers who were up to no good started flaggin my reviews in ma neighborhood i got in one little fight and my wifey got scared i said  arelax honey i'm taking ya to gary danko to hobnob with da folks from bel air' . what to order at gary danko for a first timer i agonized over this and spent much more time than i should of thinking about this. i like lists rankings as those of you who follow me know .since they make decisions easier for me.so i turned this decision making process into the research project i dubbed gary danko number of times someone indicated this was their favorite dish game. i did a very very did i say very unscientific ranking based on going over a ton of yelp reviews of friends well written reviews. i did not do a spreadsheet but i tried to list them based on how frequent i felt they were mentioned. typically i do this rough calculcation analysis in my head but i wanted to get it down on paper because there were so many darn dishes to choose from. rank below is based on the # of instances i believed people mentioned the dish as their favorite dish. risotto seemed to be winner.on down. risotto pan seared scallops roasted quail lemon pepper duck breast roast maine lobster coconut thai curry foie gras cheese plate roasted pork tenderloin and belly loin of lamb sea bass so knowing that and knowing i had a hot date my wife . i went with the decision making process below. this would achieve my primary goal of getting to try as many dishes as possible. step create list ranking above step i then asked the wifey to let me know what she was ordering. key step .happy wife happy life. step she listed risotto, seared beef, dungeness crab salad step i requested that she bump up courses so we could taste more things. it helped that i was treating o p step so basically i eliminated risotto from my rankings. she also picked two dishes that were not on my list seared beef and dungeness crab salad darn! but hey see above.happy wife happy life. step we still had courses to play with so we went straight down the list . i added sea bass only b c i love seabass. so after that initial selection here is how i felt the dishes were reranked for your viewing pleasure from fave to least fave. i also put in parentheses what i perceived to be their rank before dinner. rod's gary danko dish rankings # favepan seared scallops so soft and tasty great sauce cannellini bean puree. best scallops i've had foie gras soft like butter carmelized onions and apples bring a great dynamic. pan seared sea bass the clam succotash , sweet potato puree and shallots the seabass sits on top of were also super tasty. coconut thai curry nice presentation. the waitress bring sauce in a mini pot and pours the sauce over the candied peanuts and shitake mushrooms. the curry sauce is a seafood medley of shrimp, calamari, lobster and scallops that taste delicious risotto everything goes well together and almost tastes like a fancier filipino dish arroz caldo. this where my must order for next time line is . roasted quail this is more about the things that are stuffed mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa and foie gras with fingerling potatoes and porcini cream than it is about the actual quail. i mean this was good but not amazing to me. dungeness crab salad nr another nice presentation and taste combo with melons, cucumbers, roasted eggplant and thai mango dressing. wifey insisted that she had a light salad so that is how this made it as a selection. once again see above.happy wife happy life. roast maine lobster good ,savory but clearly behind scallops n sea bass in my eyes in the seafood category lemon pepper duck breast bacon braised endive and cardamom poached pears were an interesting combo. i thought the dish was decent but not very flavorful as other dishes and would not order again. # least fave but still o.k. seared beef nr last gnocchi was tasty and the swiss char and stilton butter are nice touches but just was not a fan of this dish. would not order again . after dinner i requested a lyft and when it came near the license plate said 'fresh' and it had dice in the mirror after five courses you may have thought this night was done but i thought nah, forget it, yo holmes, to san tung!

209,,Andrew Z.,1120,5.0,2/20/2018,"celebrating valentines day just got a whole lot easier after discovering gary danko. dinner work like this you get to choose courses for , courses for , and for . you can mix and match any number of apps, main courses, and desserts that you want. course meal of main plates no problem. course meal of all the same app you can do that too. the menu comes with sections. apps, fish and seafood, meats and game birds, cheese , and dessert. we ordered apps . glazed oysters and caviar. . dungeness crab salad with avocado over a bed of quinoa. seafood. . branzini with fennel puree. . seared scallops and lentils. meats. . lemon pepper duck breast . . roasted stuffed quail with mushrooms and foie gras. . cheese board. . trio of creme brulee. we were more than stuffed at the end. . the glazed oyster dish comes with oysters over a bed of ossetra caviar. while the oysters were ok in this leek ceam sauce, the caviar tasted amazing. light, rich, and just melts in your mouth. i would order this dish again for the caviar in the leek sauce alone. . . dungeness crab salad. while i was not overly impressed by the oysters, this salad was the whole package. instead of fine chopping crab into small chunks that you might see in other salads, here you have large pieces of crab over pieces of grapefruit and avocado. what a combination that was. i think my new favorite way of eating crab now with grapefruit! the quinoa was ok as was the vinaigrette. they gave a bit too mich quinoa.but hey, when is too much a bad thing p . . branzini is our favorite white fish so this one was an easy selection for us. oh and the saffron orange emulsion mixed with fennel puree yea it was that good. she does not like olives and im not a huge fan either, but the ones in this dish were not as sour or sharp as other olives i had. . . scallops happen to be one of my favorite things to eat and gary danko does not disappoint. two large perfectly seared scallops with potatoes, roasted peppers and a light curry vinaigrette makes this an easy . everything just works in this dish. . the duck breast came with duck hash, poached pears, and a delicious garlic puree. while every individual compnent was excellent individually, i was not sure exactly how to tackle this dish. too many complex tastes here! still the generous portion size is tough to beat . . the roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and foie gras really hit the spot. the resturant keeps you filled with sourdough bread and what better way to eat the soft bread than with a spread of foie gras oh yea, the pumpkin orzo, truffle corn bread, and glazed apple were nice, too lol. what a dish. + . . here i have to apologize. im not a cheese person and good cheese is wasted on me. . . so the trio of creme brulee ended up being quite filling. vanilla, ginger, and burbon. highly recommend! overall, . cheers!"
210,,Sydney C.,1120,4.0,2/19/2018,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster, seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast , and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast . both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
211,,Katherine C.,1120,5.0,1/24/2018,"alright, this is going to be a long review, but mainly because i have to discuss every aspect. me and my bf did the course meal, because we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we do not get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. most people would probably do fine with the courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. before i forget valet parking is but you can definitely find street parking nearby although it may be a limit of hours in terms of menu items seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples !!!! omg this was the tastiest thing i have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. it was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things i picked risotto with rock shrimp . i'm not sure if i'm a fan of risotto, i may not be as i thought this was a little salty. my bf however thought it was really really good! seared scallops !! these scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. i felt like i was eating a meal from hells kitchen lol. there was also this thing in the middle that i could not tell what it was, some sort of potato cake it was super good too. i could not exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you are going here. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce the salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good because it was not dry like other salmons you would have at other restaurants. i like dill so i automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. i enjoyed the scallops more though. roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo !!! this was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! i thought the quail would be too much work but it was not and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!! lemon pepper duck breast with pears the duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf because it felt like it did not go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway lol. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. i think if the crabcake did not throw me off i would have given this a though. herb crusted loin of lamb with dates this was a lot better than i was thinking! i do not like lamb much but this dish did not taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here. seared filet of beef with gnocci both me and my bf did not really enjoy this too much, but i think its because we realized we do not like filet. it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that is about it. flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it is an extra but definitely worth it. grand marnier souffle this did not impress me and i guess it just felt like too much egg white or maybe i just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much lol so i would recommend the other desserts. espresso martini this was definitely a unique drink that i recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini. besides the food, even though i did not think every dish was , service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and that was enough for me to give on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around but that was mainly bc we got drinks and got the course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job! overall get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"
212,,Amy C.,1120,4.0,1/21/2018,"this was my second time to gary danko. it still remains my favorite michelin star restaurant, but i thought that this time was a little less of an incredible amazing outofthisworld experience than when i was here last november. there were no missteps that i can point to, but for some reason i did not feel like the service was quite as on point as previously although it was still very, very attentive , and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. our group of ordered courses each courses is and courses is you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts . we got the following appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples . the foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. my only disappointment is that it was about of the size of the foie gras that we had here in november. maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche . probably my least favorite dish of the night. it was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, i did not think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out. seafood roast maine lobster with potato puree, blood orange, edamame and basil the lobster was very tender and went well with the puree. beautifully presented. seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers , potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette . the scallops were so tender and full of flavor. one of my favorite dishes. meat seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter . a word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. the filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender. roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms, truffled corn bread and foie gras with pumpkin orzo and glazed apples . one of my favorite dishes. the skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, celeriacgarlic puree, belgian endive and cardamom poached pears . one of my other favorite dishes. i just love duck , and the duck hash was excellent as well! herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula . the meat had an interesting flavor. it had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much. dessert chilled peanut butter bar with dark chocolate ganache, feuilletine and pretzel ice cream . excellent! very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate. they also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted minidesserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"
213,,Carolina H.,1120,5.0,11/29/2017,"my husband brought me here for our anniversary dinner, please be aware that you need to make reservations months in advance. we had the risotto for the appetizer, the herb crusted loin and lamb, lemmon pepper duck , and seared filet of beef for our main course, and baked chocolate souffle for dessert. the food was absolutely amazing! and the service was great as expected for a high scale restaurant. they made our night extra special by giving us a complimentary anniversary chocolate cake. and we got a couple of pumpkin muffins to go for breakfast! this was an amazing place for an amazing night! the atmosphere is very romantic too, we were really happy with this restaurant and we are planning on coming back every time we visit san francisco. a romantic place for a romantic night!"

215,,Evelynn C.,1120,5.0,9/12/2017,"man oh man, where do i even begin. o upon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table sidebyside. it was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. it was totally fine though because i love dining next to my boyfriend just as much as across from him p a wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the rules which is that there are not really any you can pick and choose from any section for your , , or course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. we opted to get a course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. after everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that i had ordered and allowed me to try some first before i got stuck with it. in general, i knew that i liked cabs and red blends so i knew the blend that i picked would not do me any injustice one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine. the wait staff rotated constantly so we were not able to bond with one, but that is ok too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected. appetizers risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, summer squash this was so yummy, i love seafood and so shrimp dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. my boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. funnily, even though he is extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day. seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries actually my first time that i tried foie gras this was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, meltinyourmouth deliciousness. definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. musttry if you have never tried foie gras!! fish and seafood roast maine lobster more seafood, my nd course pick. the lobster was so fresh, so tender. this set the new standard for all things seafood for me. the texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. until next time. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce hm, i generally really enjoy salmon, unfortunately or fortunately everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and i do not recall it being super outofthis world. perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here. meat and game birds juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms mmm bison. another first for me. actually i may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something heh.heh this was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. this was also a win for me. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries i do not usually go for duck . i'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this. was pretty much lifechanging. they sliced the mound of duck breast thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. i was honestly pretty surprised how much i liked this! good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork! desserts trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies who does not love creme brulee and it comes with different types. sold! lemon souffle cake with creme fraiche panna cotta and raspberry sorbet the tartness of the lemon helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than i would have preferred. ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds. dessertwise. my complimentary birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and i'm not even normally a chocolateloving person too sweet % of the time . however, their rendition of a chocolate cake mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that i became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. as if the complimentary birthday cake was not enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies petit fleurs , and gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! from service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was a+++."
216,,Alex T.,1120,5.0,9/4/2017,"finally, after hearing so much about gary danko i had the chance to come dine in this elegant restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday. we made reservations weeks in advance where the staff informed us what available dates and times they had and they even called us a day before our reservation as a friendly reminder. if you are worried about parking, do not be. there are plenty of options around the area with their own valet parking for , a parking garage up the block, or metered street parking good for up to hours until pm. we were lucky to have found metered parking down the block in a heavy traffic area. upon arrival we were greeted by the host and seated promptly. our waiter asked if we have dine at gary danko before and we replied that we have not and he kindly went through all of our options and answered every questions we had. you basically choose your preferred amount of courses and pick any item on the menu. if you chose a course you can grab desserts or entrees etc you are not limited to getting appetizer, entree and dessert you can choose whatever you like. our waiter also stated that they do not recommend all meat poultry dishes for your courses but, if we wanted to, they will not decline to give it to you. food review i went with the course meal and my partner with courses. we were also given a lot of free stuff along with every diner in the restaurant compliments from the chef. we were given a pea soup appetizer, for dessert we were given assortment of chocolate and sweets, and a parting cake gift. my selection consisted of glazed oyster with osetra caviar with zucchini pearls, leeks and lettuce cream, roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon, and herb crusted loin of lamb with summer vegetable tian and polenta. they were all done very well and i would recommend any of these dishes all the meats were cooked perfctly medium rare and just melted in my mouth like butter. they were pretty small in portions and wondered if i would be full and if i made the right choice with a course meal but, luckily the loin of lamb did the job! my partner ordered the ahi tuna, seared foie gras, with caramelized onions, and cherry, lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries, and the trio of creme brulee. all were done amazingly and much heartier than my choices. the only dish that was underwhelming for me was the ahi tuna, where the cumin was really present and the lime juice made the dish really acidic as well. the old fashion i ordered was perfectly mad and one of the best i've had and the moscow mule was plenty strong. end food review the staff were all exquisite and attentive and could be the best service i've had in a restaurant. there will be two main impressions people will have about gary danko the restaurant either you will love it or you will think it is just okay. i loved my experienced here but, i know many friends who thought it was okay. our waiter gave us a little tip after bringing us the bill, if they are full, you can always come by and sit at the bar without reservations. you will be able to order food a la carte and dessert which was great to know for the future. after picking up the bill our waiter also asked us if we need validation, if we used their valet or if he could call a cab for us which was great for them to offer!"
217,,Sam L.,1120,5.0,9/3/2017,"the ultimate complete american finedining experience, bar none! being lucky enough to have experienced jean georges in nyc's trump tower, oringer's clio in the elliot boston closed forever , lee's susur in kings west toronto closed forever one realizes how precious an establishment like gary danko really is. excellent food aside, the incredible ambience of the venue together with the to hours of vip prince princesses treatment by the entire crew down to the very minute details of the evening makes every gary danko visit a total pleasure. we definitely do not belong to the bookahead, and dresswellfordinner genre and despite the last minute booking and being subpar underdressed gary's crew made sure we felt superbly comfortable and valued throughout the evening right from the moment we entered the door, the impeccably dressed maitre d steven welcomed us, waiter andrew was tending to our every need during the evening, up until we left walking past the valet to hail our uber. being from a first generation immigrant family, dining value is important and still very much in our blood. it is amazing that danko's menu together with some of the other bestinbusiness operations like jean georges' and oringer's had been design to cater to even this slient niche foodie minority. making us feel great! being able to feast on finely plated and gourmet prepped assembled seared foie gras, roasted lobster, seared sea bass, and lemon pepper duck breast for around each sooths the frugal soul beats slumming in chinatown for the same stuff by distant miles. the wellpaced delivery, presentation of each dish, together with various 'complements of the chef' offerings throughout the evening, justifies the smaller tasting sized portions, ensuring our palate is never numbed enough from being full not to taste the fine ingredient and preparation of each dish. the  wouldesert after desert' and the 'take home cake' were some of the final touches that sealed this gary danko experience as among the finest dining experiences in our lives. thanks to the dedication of gary and his crew for keeping this class dining act inplay, for almost two decades. it is not an easy task anywhere, not to mention operating smack center in the tourist zone in one of the most expensive cities in the world to run a restaurant. danko is a gift to san francisco. treasure it while it lasts."
218,,Ada H.,1120,3.0,8/13/2017,"i really do not want to give this place three stars. i feel like on any other given night, i would have given stars. my boyfriend and i were seated promptly as soon as we got into gary danko. while my water was being filled, i got a slight splash of water on my dress. i brushed it off thinking eh one small thing like this does not mean this place has bad service. we ordered our drinks before we ordered our food. my boyfriend got a blanton and i was not sure if i wanted a sweeter wine but i did say one of the sweeter wines sounded good. the wait staff told me i could try it and if i liked it i could get it by the glass. the blanton was served first since they had to get the wine from the cellar. it was served in a chipped glass. i cannot fathom how someone can serve anything in a chipped glass in this type of establishment. we told the wait staff and they told us they would get us a new glass. we waited through our appetizers and entrees before my boyfriend finally flagged someone down to check up on his drink. when my wine arrived, he had my try a sip. i was not impressed by it so i asked for a pinot noir suggestion on the more fruit forward side. this guy had the audacity to make a snide comment of well you should have just stuck with pinot . well what if i wanted to try something different what a repulsive attitude this guy had all night. must have been a bad day but i still tried to be polite with this guy. anyways, the food is the most important part. this is the sole reason i am here. the seafood risotto was extremely creamy and light. delicate pieces of seafood just complimented the risotto. this is a must get here! the glazed oysters with osetra caviar is also a must get. the oysters were plump and was sweet while the caviar was light and salty which gave a good pop to the overall texture and taste. for this dish, it is an acquired taste. my boyfriend does not like the taste of the sea. thai coconut with seafood. those plump chunks of scallops were tender and not sandy which is the downfall of most places. thai coconut curry is light so it does not over power the flavors of the seafood. lemon pepper duck breast was not my forte. i usually like duck but i felt as if the duck was very bland. biggest disappointment of the night. strawberry souffle was light and fluffy. delicious as expected. like i said, maybe on another night i would have given this place stars, but the service was repulsive and unprofessional."
219,,Angela H.,1120,5.0,6/28/2017,"gary danko is an amazing restaurant! i celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here while we were visiting san francisco, and we were fortunate enough to be seated in a private booth for just us two! each table has red roses on it too, which made it quite romantic! service was beyond impeccable. there were multiple individuals servicing our table, which made the dinner go very smoothly. they cleared our tables quickly, checked in on us multiple times, served us without any lag time, and refilled our waters without having to ask. i got the course menu , and my boyfriend got the course menu . they served us each our plates, but we just shared our meals family style. thai soup amuse bouche with lobster it was very hearty, light, and flavorful. i wish they would have listed this as part of their menu because it was amazing, even better than some of their menu items. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, spring vegetables, and beech mushrooms most risottos are unbearably heavy and rich, but this was not. it actually reminded me of a thicker congee, so it was comforting to eat. they were also very generous with the shrimp and crab, which i really appreciated. glazed oysters with osetra caviar, white asparagus, leeks, and lettuce cream this was the perfect appetizer! the oysters were like little clouds in my mouth because it was just so fluffy and light. but if you are generally not a fan of oysters, i would not recommend it though because it does have a slight seafoody taste. roast maine lobster with potato puree, morel mushrooms, edamame, and tarragon the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the potato puree was a very flavorful mashed potato. i loved the broth that came with the plate! portion wise, this is a quite small plate, so just be aware if you are choosing this as an entree. coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, candied peanuts, and shiitake mushrooms omg. this is a must order plate. it was the best dish of the night! you are initially served a plate of white rice, and one of the servers then places the seafood around the rice and then pours the coconut thai curry over the rice and seafood. the flavor is so amazing that i honestly wanted another plate or even two! it is just so light and comforting. all the seafood was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. pan seared scallops with english peamint puree, asparagus, fava beans, and beech mushrooms scallops were so perfectly cooked! the description also says fava beans, but i think i had lentils with mine. overall, really solid dish. soft she will crab with pancetta, roasted eggplant, cucumber and thai lime dressing this was more like two separate dishes placed onto one plate. the soft she will crab was extremely flavorful, and the herb salad on the side was very refreshing. it reminded me of the inside of a vietnamese spring roll. portion wise, this is also a small plate, so just be aware. roasted quail stuffed with mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa, and foie gras with baby artichokes and green garlic it does not say in the description, but it is served with a mini corn bread cake, which i loved! the quail was super adorable and petite. i thought it was pretty great but nothing too special. the quail drumsticks were probably the highlight of this dish. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive, and port glazed cherries that duck breast was the definition of perfection. it was so well cooked and delicious. if you are not used to gamey meats, then beware that it is a tad more chewy than beef. as for the duck hash and all the sides, i could care less for them. those were just okay. trio creme brulee with assorted cookies there are creme brulee vanilla bean, brandy, and blueberry lemongrass. the vanilla is the classic one, and i just thought it was so yummy. the brandy one is a bit too rich and heavy, so i did not really enjoy it. the blueberry lemongrass one was a beautiful dark purple color, and it was tart in flavor. the assorted cookies were just okay. extra complimentary assorted dessert plate we received bitesized desserts that were all different in flavor. there was only one that i did not enjoy, which was the red jelly one. otherwise, i would recommend trying all of them because they were delicious. extra complimentary birthday chocolate mousse cake this was very sweet of them to bring out for my boyfriend's birthday. if you truly love the flavor of chocolate, then this is the dessert for you. it is not like the grocery market chocolate. it has a more rich, bitter chocolate flavor to it that is amazing on the palate. extra complimentary pineapple cheesecake muffin breakfast bread i love that they gave us something to bring home, especially since it was so convenient to eat the next morning before a flight. loved it! plus the wrapping was super cute!"
220,,Faye M.,1120,5.0,10/24/2018,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster , juniper crusted bison, filet of beef, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
221,,Katy W.,1120,5.0,10/19/2018,"tl dr do not hesitate. book the reservation. it is the most bang for your buck michelin star experience you will get. the service is amazing and the food is even better. do it. and then read reviews to figure out what dishes you want. seriously, one of my favorite dining experiences ever. worth every penny you spend here and more!!! we came here for our joint th birthdays. after much thought, we decided that gd has been one of our top dining experiences and that there was no better place to spend our birthdays. we each ordered the course dinner. salt cured foie gras torchon with peach compote his the lesser of the two foie dishes, but still delicious. i wish there was more bread for the foie, but that is our only gripe with this dish. seared foie gras with caramelized onions & black mission figs mine oh my god. get this. the onions, foie, and figs pair perfectly for an explosion in your mouth. would get again. roasted sea scallops mine i got this dish last time, and got it again this time. it never disappoints and is always delicious. the cook on the scallop is perfect and it is tender and juicy. roast maine lobster his if i was not mildly allergic to lobster , this would have been my dish. the components of this dish really seal the deal. the lobster was cooked well and not gummy. seared filet his probably our least favorite dish of the evening, but even then, it is something we enjoyed. the cook medium rare was great and the basil butter excellent. pan seared bass mine i ordered this even though i'm not a fan of bell peppers or capers.but seriously, i am so impressed. i cleared my plate and finished it all. impressive especially if you know me and know that i will pick the tiniest piece of bell pepper out of any dish. lemon pepper duck breast mine i will admit that by this course, i was feeling fully stuffed and needed to save room for dessert. so i took a taste and asked them to box it up for me. even as my lunch the next day.it was delicious. best lunch ever. note gd's duck has been my favorite dish out of any duck dish i've had.even internationally. do not miss out. trio of creme brulee mine my favorite dessert is creme brulee. if it is on the menu, i will get it. three of them sold. the flavors this time were vanilla, bourbon, and ginger. the vanilla was wonderful cannot ever go wrong with the og. the bourbon was to die for. it tasted like caramel and flan it was just the right amount of gooey and melt in your mouth. it was super sweet though. the ginger one was the only one that was slightly disappointing. it had a little too much bite and was overpowering. i love the take home cake they send you with. they used to only give it to the women in the dining party, but this time they gave us two!!!! mmmm mmm mm pineapple cake for breakfast the next morning. not going to lie, the take home cake plays a huge role in my decision to come back to gd. service is impeccable but that is exactly what you should expect from somewhere as old school as gd. the last time we came, i was in a soft cast for my foot and they were super accommodating with my temporary handicap. this time, one of our entrees took a little longer than they expected. we did not mind since we understand that saturday nights are busy. but they comped a glass for wine for me and a glass of fancy merlot grape juice for my boyfriend. i cannot wait to come back here again it is still one of my our favorite dining experiences meals. goal try every menu item and every cheese on the cheese cart."
222,,Bailey Z.,1120,4.0,5/30/2018,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains , the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef, which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake. as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."
223,,Andrew C.,1120,4.0,5/24/2018,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "

226,,Trish P.,1120,4.0,3/6/2018,"i wanted to jump on the bandwagon of giving gary danko a star, but i would betray myself if i do so. maybe i was expecting too much out of gary danko i wanted to love my experience at gd, but let me put it this way if you have never been to gd and you think that perhaps you are missing outwell hun, you are not. but a once in a while visit would be luxurious enough. ok let us talk food for starters, they provided us with yellow beets for amuse bouche, and i would say, i will order this by itself as an appetizer if only it was on the menu! it was so good! i had the course menu consisting of the following cured foie gras torchon with roasted grapes, candied peanuts, & honey tuille this is below the best foie gras i've ever tasted! the perfect foie gras torchon is supposed to kinda melt on your tongue like a creamy butter. ths one was served cold as it should be. yes, foie gras torchon is the kind of thing that is got to be served as cold as possible, but then when you do serve it, you got to provide a warm knife. that way the foie gras kinda melts in the mouth. you know what i mean well, they did the former but not the latter. again, like i said, perhaps i was expecting too much. seared ahi tuna with avocado, nori, enoki mushrooms and lemon soy dressing came with slices aesthetically placed to look like a tuna butterfly cute! , the two bigger portions had a rich bright red color, which was the most desirable. the two smaller ones patched with the nori had a brownish color when i flipped it. the taste was not the freshest. i traded this one with my friend's plate and i ate his panseared bass plate instead. pan seared bass with israeli couscous, broccoli, glazed turnips, and radish oh, my goodness, thank you for this saving grace! the pan seared bass was cooked to perfection, and the couscous is probably the best version i've ever tasted of it. mixed together, they were exploding with tastiness and flavor, i was wowed. roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon small lobster portion enough to fill my tiny body. the lobster was tender cooked saturated with tasty potato puree. it was good. grand marnier souffle with creamsicle ice cream and two sauces raspberry and something else a really pale version of souffle that spent time in the oven just the right amount of time. it was not too airy, nice texture, deftly sweetened. i ate it all by myself! heh. now let us talk service they offer coat checkins and valet service. they did not ask for my id when i ordered winei'm impressed. other restaurants are fooled by my asian genes. gd staff did not bother. they serve complimentary bread, which was quite boring frankly, it was a waste of time _ they give you a little cake if you made your reservation and told them it was for a celebration. it was my best friend's birthday, so i got to blow the cake candle for him. haha. their bathroom looks elegant, like, why is there a chair beside the toilet seat there are reasons to this of course. our server s were not really personable, they were like in allbusiness mode and that was not very friendly or welcoming. they give you little takeaway desserts pastries wrapped in a golden package so that you will remember them even when you get home. kind of like, to reinforce the unforgettable dining experience you had last night."
227,,Sydney C.,1120,4.0,2/19/2018,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster , seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster , coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
228,,Amy C.,1120,4.0,1/21/2018,"this was my second time to gary danko. it still remains my favorite michelin star restaurant, but i thought that this time was a little less of an incredible amazing outofthisworld experience than when i was here last november. there were no missteps that i can point to, but for some reason i did not feel like the service was quite as on point as previously although it was still very, very attentive , and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. our group of ordered courses each courses is and courses is you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts . we got the following appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples . the foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. my only disappointment is that it was about of the size of the foie gras that we had here in november. maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche . probably my least favorite dish of the night. it was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, i did not think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out. seafood roast maine lobster with potato puree, blood orange, edamame and basil the lobster was very tender and went well with the puree. beautifully presented. seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers, potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette . the scallops were so tender and full of flavor. one of my favorite dishes. meat seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter . a word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. the filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender. roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms, truffled corn bread and foie gras with pumpkin orzo and glazed apples . one of my favorite dishes. the skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, celeriacgarlic puree, belgian endive and cardamom poached pears . one of my other favorite dishes. i just love duck, and the duck hash was excellent as well! herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula . the meat had an interesting flavor. it had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much. dessert chilled peanut butter bar with dark chocolate ganache, feuilletine and pretzel ice cream . excellent! very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate. they also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted minidesserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"
229,,Tina C.,1120,5.0,11/22/2017,"my all time favorite restaurant in sf!! i booked my reservation two months in advance just to get the desirable date n time that i wanted. the host called three days early just to confirm it with me. i also requested to sit in the main dining room because i thought the second room was a lil too crowded and the decoration is not as nice as the main dining room. we reserved it for two people at pm. lots of street meter parking but it is free after . we were greeted and seated right away from the host. my boyfriend and i decided to get the five course meal. there is also complimentary bread n butter in the beginning. i ordered seared ahi tuna, roast maine lobster , lamb, duck breast, and lastly cheesecake for dessert. everything was spectacular and delicious. i really do not have any complaints at all. they were that amazing from the food to the service. bill was for two people excluding tips. if you want to celebrate and go to somewhere special gary danko is the place to be!"
230,,Jenny C.,1120,5.0,10/21/2017,"i absolutely loved my time at gary danko. the menu was super flexible and let you choose courses depending on how many dishes you wanted to try. you could even choose entrees if you wanted though of course not recommended . the service was impeccable and the waiters are all very knowledgeable about all the dishes. they aimed to make sure you left very wellfed and satisfied. when i was unsure of whether or not to get a certain drink, they even let me sample it before deciding i did not even ask to sample it, but very much appreciated that they allowed me to do so. they even threw in a free amuse bouche in the beginning, a parcel of pineapple cake to take home, and a tray of assorted desserts at the end. i came with a friend and we each chose to do a course meal totaling different dishes to try . i loved each and every one of them, but of those, i highly recommend the following seared foie gras my friend thought this was even better than the foie gras we had in paris , glazed oysters, roast maine lobster , and if you love cheese the cheeseboard harbison and chimay . definitely plan to come back at some point in the future."
231,,Susan L.,1120,5.0,9/15/2017,my favorite fine dining experience of all times. the food is all so well prepared with perfect service. . rissoto dung crab . seared filet of beef . roast maine lobster . glazed oyster . quail versus squab . duck . bison . foie gra . melon with creme fresh soup complimentary . dessert petit fours plate complimentary . bread to go! complimentary paired with prosecco. we ordered a bit too much and was overly stuffed. will go back for sure but maybe go for less dish. we picked dishes each. my fav part of this you can pick and choose any dish. word of advice if you are not a huge dessert person see above . they will provide a plate so go for the entree dishes! just writing this review a year later and i'm realizing that we have to come back now!
232,,Jimmy I.,1120,2.0,9/13/2017,"tldr place is only good for the ambiance and plating maybe seafood . nothing special. there is no bang for the buck in the food. do not eat the birthday cake. i think minny the help made it with her special ingredient. i did some research for our vacation and people recommended to reserve restaurants only a week in advance. bad idea. all the top choices were completely booked and this was the only place still taking reservations. no surprise i had requested we get a table where we can sit next to each other during the confirmation call. instead they still seated us at a table where we were sitting across from each other, and i had to talk to different people before they changed our table of which never came back and of those people actually ignored me when i tried to get their attention i made eye contact and i signaled] . bread the first round of bread was so stale it actually clanked when dropped not placed on my plate. second round of bread was ok, but my appetite was already completely destroyed by the horrible bread before. appetizers poached farm egg honestly this was pretty good. it is one of the few reasons it is getting a stars. i recommend the poached egg if you decide to come here against my recommendation. perfectly cooked. simple yet rich taste. seared foie gras with caramelized onions i usually like foie gras, but this was horrible. the best part of this dish was the caramelized onions. foie gras was not seared, but burned where one side was actually crispy. i was told it should be like that. no. no. no! i know what a forced fed duck liver's texture and taste is suppose to be like. seafood roast maine lobster the lobster was better than what i was expecting after having tasted all the other courses before it. the lobster was fresh and well seasoned. the flavors worked together harmoniously. i would recommend it. taking into consideration the lobsters were from maine , it was quite good. seared scallops the peamint puree complimented the scallops exceptionally well. well made. do i think it could have been better yes. was it satisfactory yes. it was good but not great. i would say that a nd or rd year culinary student with a bright future made this. any place with on yelp, i expect nothing short of greatness not something that is a work in progress. meat lamb bison they were both pretty bad. the quality of meat was just terrible. you can tell the chef did the best he could with the ingredients he has, but boy was the meat bad. they gave a plentiful amount of sauce to cover up the bad meat, but you cannot hide a bad foundation. cheese raisin bread with cheese really the cheese on the cart was bad. we got a recommendation of the most popular cheese and they were all terrible. there was obvious signs that the cheese has been aerated for quiet some time before they were served. the discoloration was bad. with low lighting and wine, it feels like they think you will not notice the difference. are those grapes from safeway taste like it. desserts do not eat the birthday cake. tastes horrible. does not even taste like chocolate. it reminds me of the day when i get a case of the runs and the smell of your own fecal matter makes you want to vomit. that smell is what the taste is like. i actually vomited a little into the napkin. i took it to go and threw it out once i got out of the door. i would not even give it to a homeless person. strawberry souffle the best part was the strawberry sorbet. rich strawberry sorbet. everything else was trash. i normally like anything strawberry but this was so bad i felt sorry for the strawberries. it looks good when they pour the sauces in. it tastes completely and utterly disappointing. it tasted like trash and went directly in the trash. flambe it was decent. the guy making it did not seem to know what he was doing and was actually shaking quite a bit. the pieces of pineapple were extremely sour. at least use ripe fruits. the sauce was good, but it was only made up of ingredients sugar, butter, and alcohol. also other servers were constantly brushing past him, it was somewhat annoying. let the man make my dessert undisturbed! p.s. also most servers are wearing oversized suits. if i wanted to see people with baggy shirts and pants, i would just go back to high school. at least look presentable."
233,,Evelynn C.,1120,5.0,9/12/2017,"man oh man, where do i even begin. o upon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table sidebyside. it was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. it was totally fine though because i love dining next to my boyfriend just as much as across from him p a wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the rules which is that there are not really any you can pick and choose from any section for your , , or course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. we opted to get a course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. after everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that i had ordered and allowed me to try some first before i got stuck with it. in general, i knew that i liked cabs and red blends so i knew the blend that i picked would not do me any injustice one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine. the wait staff rotated constantly so we were not able to bond with one, but that is ok too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected. appetizers risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, summer squash this was so yummy, i love seafood and so shrimp dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. my boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. funnily, even though he is extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day. seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries actually my first time that i tried foie gras this was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, meltinyourmouth deliciousness. definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. musttry if you have never tried foie gras!! fish and seafood roast maine lobster more seafood, my nd course pick. the lobster was so fresh, so tender. this set the new standard for all things seafood for me. the texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. until next time. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce hm, i generally really enjoy salmon, unfortunately or fortunately everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and i do not recall it being super outofthis world. perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here. meat and game birds juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms mmm bison. another first for me. actually i may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something heh.heh this was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. this was also a win for me. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries i do not usually go for duck. i'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this. was pretty much lifechanging. they sliced the mound of duck breast thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. i was honestly pretty surprised how much i liked this! good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork! desserts trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies who does not love creme brulee and it comes with different types. sold! lemon souffle cake with creme fraiche panna cotta and raspberry sorbet the tartness of the lemon helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than i would have preferred. ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds. dessertwise. my complimentary birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and i'm not even normally a chocolateloving person too sweet % of the time . however, their rendition of a chocolate cake mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that i became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. as if the complimentary birthday cake was not enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies petit fleurs , and gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! from service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was a+++."
234,,Alex T.,1120,5.0,9/4/2017,"finally, after hearing so much about gary danko i had the chance to come dine in this elegant restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday. we made reservations weeks in advance where the staff informed us what available dates and times they had and they even called us a day before our reservation as a friendly reminder. if you are worried about parking, do not be. there are plenty of options around the area with their own valet parking for , a parking garage up the block, or metered street parking good for up to hours until pm. we were lucky to have found metered parking down the block in a heavy traffic area. upon arrival we were greeted by the host and seated promptly. our waiter asked if we have dine at gary danko before and we replied that we have not and he kindly went through all of our options and answered every questions we had. you basically choose your preferred amount of courses and pick any item on the menu. if you chose a course you can grab desserts or entrees etc you are not limited to getting appetizer, entree and dessert you can choose whatever you like. our waiter also stated that they do not recommend all meat poultry dishes for your courses but, if we wanted to, they will not decline to give it to you. food review i went with the course meal and my partner with courses. we were also given a lot of free stuff along with every diner in the restaurant compliments from the chef. we were given a pea soup appetizer, for dessert we were given assortment of chocolate and sweets, and a parting cake gift. my selection consisted of glazed oyster with osetra caviar with zucchini pearls, leeks and lettuce cream, roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon, and herb crusted loin of lamb with summer vegetable tian and polenta. they were all done very well and i would recommend any of these dishes all the meats were cooked perfctly medium rare and just melted in my mouth like butter. they were pretty small in portions and wondered if i would be full and if i made the right choice with a course meal but, luckily the loin of lamb did the job! my partner ordered the ahi tuna, seared foie gras, with caramelized onions, and cherry, lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries, and the trio of creme brulee. all were done amazingly and much heartier than my choices. the only dish that was underwhelming for me was the ahi tuna, where the cumin was really present and the lime juice made the dish really acidic as well. the old fashion i ordered was perfectly mad and one of the best i've had and the moscow mule was plenty strong. end food review the staff were all exquisite and attentive and could be the best service i've had in a restaurant. there will be two main impressions people will have about gary danko the restaurant either you will love it or you will think it is just okay. i loved my experienced here but, i know many friends who thought it was okay. our waiter gave us a little tip after bringing us the bill, if they are full, you can always come by and sit at the bar without reservations. you will be able to order food a la carte and dessert which was great to know for the future. after picking up the bill our waiter also asked us if we need validation, if we used their valet or if he could call a cab for us which was great for them to offer!"
235,,Hailey P.,1120,4.0,8/14/2017,"i have to admit, i've been avoiding this review for a few weeks now because there is so much to write about!! i came here for a fun team dinner because we are all foodies and have had gary danko on our bucket lists for a long time now. we showed up right on time for our reservation and were seated immediately. a total plus at such a popular spot! we ordered drinks from the very friendly som and i got an extra dirty martini because duh, this is the place to get one. they did take a long time to come out! but other than that, it was dirty {blue cheese olives and all} and delightful. they have a super cool menu setup where you choose the amount of courses that you would like to taste and can pick anything that you want from their very extensive menu. heck, if you wanted to choose courses of dessert, you could! there are definitely items on there for everyone! or you can choose to go with their chef's tasting menu and not have to worry about a thing because let me tell you, narrowing down your options to only , , or dishes is no easy task at gd! you will be fighting 'your eyes are bigger than your stomach' the entire time because you are sure to want to try one of everything. while i debated courses for a long time, i'm really happy that i stuck with , it ended up being the right amount of food and a good variety of items. the portions are pretty small though, so without the endless amounts of bread they were serving while waiting for the food to come out, i may have still been a tad hungry with only the . now here were the courses that i chose! first course dungeness crab salad with avocado, citrus, bulgar and mustardtarragon vinaigrette delicious!!! the tarragon flavor really made it unique and tasty. second course poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche i was super bummed about this dish. when i think carbonara, i think pasta dish, but this is literally just a poached egg over a very tiny cracker. not a fan! third course roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon i really enjoyed this course. it was very small in size, i.e. not much lobster but flavorful and you do get the claws. sweet meat and yummy! fourth course seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter my favorite! i'm a meat and potatoes girl and this was amazing. thank goodness for this course because i may have still been hungry if it was as tiny as the others. i opted out of my own dessert but tried some of the others at the table. the strawberry souffle was pretty dang incredible! they also bring complimentary mini sweets to your table at the end of the meal so if you only need a little sweet bite to cap off your meal, i would use your course choices on the main dishes! all in all, the portions were small, service was on the slower side, and to be completely honest, it was not the best meal that i've ever had in my life. when spending {just for one person} i guess i was expecting a tad bit more 'awe factor'. they definitely have a ton of hype which is great for business but maybe do some research before choosing to dine here! if you are not worried about money, come here you are sure to have a good meal."
236,,Kim T.,1120,5.0,8/8/2017,"i've only been to one other tasting menu before and gary danko takes the cake in my opinion. the service was exceptional and the food was out of this world. reservations were not that hard to get but we booked it a few weeks in advanced. so let us break it down we got the courses for person you can pick whatever you want from each section appetizer main dessert etc appetizer poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche this one was okay, it tasted just like it would sound. the plating was beautiful! nothing that special about this one. salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon compote, toasted pistachios and country bread holy moly this was the best thing i have ever tasted, my taste buds were on fire. i have never had gras before so this being my first time it set the bar very high. it was so melt in your mouth delicious and you get a little bit of sweet with the compote ugh this is a must must must try if you get the chance to come here. fish & seafood roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon who does not like lobster and creamy dreamy potatoes. this was also a winner in my book, but i think the bass was better if i had to pick one. pan seared bass with eggplantfennel marmalade, broccoli rabe, shiitake mushrooms and soymustard glaze must try there is so much umami in this dish. the fresh fish, chewy shiitake mushrooms, and the soy glaze mixed all together is like an explosion in your mouth. salty and sweet, with earthy tones. i loveeeeeed this dish! game & meat seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter the steak cut like buttttaaaaaa, it was so good! the only thing i did not like was there was something that tasted like blue cheese and that totally threw me off guard. juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms, cipollini onions and wild nettle spatzle this one was ok in my opinion. it was kinda dry. overall i love this place you need to try this place out because you do not want to die not knowing how good this place is. totally worth the hype!!!"
237,,Kara D.,1120,5.0,8/7/2017,"dinner at gary danko was literally perfect and i loved everything i ordered. i could eat a tick off the table and be like, oh, daaaaanko you have done it again! .this is kinda an inside joke and you will % never find a tick there . dining with the coolest crew ever certainly did not hurt the situation shoutout to trish s, kris you, damien s, nikki w, jando s, and hailey p! the atmosphere was not as stuffy as we thought it would be we loved that the employees yucked it up with us. with an extensive and impressive menu, we were able to mix and match which items and courses we wanted. i ordered seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter strawberry souffle with strawberry sauce and strawberry sorbet. result everything was absolutely superb. a couple things that blew my mind, though, was the incredibly tender lobster , fluffy gnocchi, and the most beautiful and exquisite souffle i've ever seen. it was seriously dreamy and everything i hoped it would be i squealed. i cannot say it was the most innovative meal i've had, but it was all executed perfectly and there was not one tiny thing i did not enjoy. except maybe that one random sequined pillow. pro tip call months ahead of time to make a group reservation."
238,,Angela H.,1120,5.0,6/28/2017,"gary danko is an amazing restaurant! i celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here while we were visiting san francisco, and we were fortunate enough to be seated in a private booth for just us two! each table has red roses on it too, which made it quite romantic! service was beyond impeccable. there were multiple individuals servicing our table, which made the dinner go very smoothly. they cleared our tables quickly, checked in on us multiple times, served us without any lag time, and refilled our waters without having to ask. i got the course menu , and my boyfriend got the course menu . they served us each our plates, but we just shared our meals family style. thai soup amuse bouche with lobster it was very hearty, light, and flavorful. i wish they would have listed this as part of their menu because it was amazing, even better than some of their menu items. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, spring vegetables, and beech mushrooms most risottos are unbearably heavy and rich, but this was not. it actually reminded me of a thicker congee, so it was comforting to eat. they were also very generous with the shrimp and crab, which i really appreciated. glazed oysters with osetra caviar, white asparagus, leeks, and lettuce cream this was the perfect appetizer! the oysters were like little clouds in my mouth because it was just so fluffy and light. but if you are generally not a fan of oysters, i would not recommend it though because it does have a slight seafoody taste. roast maine lobster with potato puree, morel mushrooms, edamame, and tarragon the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the potato puree was a very flavorful mashed potato. i loved the broth that came with the plate! portion wise, this is a quite small plate, so just be aware if you are choosing this as an entree. coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster , scallops, candied peanuts, and shiitake mushrooms omg. this is a must order plate. it was the best dish of the night! you are initially served a plate of white rice, and one of the servers then places the seafood around the rice and then pours the coconut thai curry over the rice and seafood. the flavor is so amazing that i honestly wanted another plate or even two! it is just so light and comforting. all the seafood was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. pan seared scallops with english peamint puree, asparagus, fava beans, and beech mushrooms scallops were so perfectly cooked! the description also says fava beans, but i think i had lentils with mine. overall, really solid dish. soft she will crab with pancetta, roasted eggplant, cucumber and thai lime dressing this was more like two separate dishes placed onto one plate. the soft she will crab was extremely flavorful, and the herb salad on the side was very refreshing. it reminded me of the inside of a vietnamese spring roll. portion wise, this is also a small plate, so just be aware. roasted quail stuffed with mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa, and foie gras with baby artichokes and green garlic it does not say in the description, but it is served with a mini corn bread cake, which i loved! the quail was super adorable and petite. i thought it was pretty great but nothing too special. the quail drumsticks were probably the highlight of this dish. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive, and port glazed cherries that duck breast was the definition of perfection. it was so well cooked and delicious. if you are not used to gamey meats, then beware that it is a tad more chewy than beef. as for the duck hash and all the sides, i could care less for them. those were just okay. trio creme brulee with assorted cookies there are creme brulee vanilla bean, brandy, and blueberry lemongrass. the vanilla is the classic one, and i just thought it was so yummy. the brandy one is a bit too rich and heavy, so i did not really enjoy it. the blueberry lemongrass one was a beautiful dark purple color, and it was tart in flavor. the assorted cookies were just okay. extra complimentary assorted dessert plate we received bitesized desserts that were all different in flavor. there was only one that i did not enjoy, which was the red jelly one. otherwise, i would recommend trying all of them because they were delicious. extra complimentary birthday chocolate mousse cake this was very sweet of them to bring out for my boyfriend's birthday. if you truly love the flavor of chocolate, then this is the dessert for you. it is not like the grocery market chocolate. it has a more rich, bitter chocolate flavor to it that is amazing on the palate. extra complimentary pineapple cheesecake muffin breakfast bread i love that they gave us something to bring home, especially since it was so convenient to eat the next morning before a flight. loved it! plus the wrapping was super cute!"
239,,Julie L.,1120,3.0,6/26/2017,"this place is three stars, at most. my boyfriend and i made our reservation two months in advance for our anniversary and although service was nice, the food was mediocre, at best. it is possible i came on a bad day.or i just do not have the palate for the food. this place has been on my foodie wish list for a long ass time. i've heard so many good things about it! so for two months, i looked forward to dining here and even planned out what i was going to order, lol. we ordered two cocktails and fourcourse meals, consisting of risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, spring vegetables and beech mushrooms this was creamy and rich as expected, filled with seafood, but i'm simply not a risotto person this was bf's choice seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries this was better than many of the things we ordered, but nothing to rave about roast maine lobster with potato puree, morel mushrooms, edamame and tarragon the lobster was cooked to perfection. a good portion, but missing something. coriander, black pepper and rosemary crusted tuna with piperade, spinach and anchovygarlic essence eh this was ok pan seared scallops with english peamint puree, asparagus, fava beans and beech mushrooms probably my favorite dish _ the scallops were huge and flavorful. herb crusted loin of lamb with spring vegetable tian and polenta was not memorable seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter this was probably the worst thing we ordered.there was literally no seasoning on the beef. it tasted so bland. juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms, cipollini onions and wild nettle spatzle meat was tender and flavorful, but eh. after finishing our food, we were given a small plate of assorted baked goods, which we appreciated, but we did not receive the complementary celebration cake mousse with a candle that everyone else has mentioned note that i included in our reservation that this was to celebrate our anniversary . that left a sour taste in my mouth because i saw other tables receive it. aside from all of the above, the only thing that deserves stars is their service they were very attentive and refilled our waters most of the time and gave us bread. i appreciated that while i was in the restroom, they brought our food and they put an old dutch lid on our dishes until i came out. we also got two baked goods to take home for the next day, which was nice. but again, mediocre at best. none of the items we ordered stood out. so it makes me wonder do you come here for the food or for the service not to mention, my boyfriend felt sick all night after eating gary danko.so we are definitely not coming back. terribly disappointed with our experience."
240,,Faye M.,1120,5.0,10/24/2018,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef , stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
241,,Lindsey S.,1120,5.0,9/6/2018,"gary danko is hands down my favorite restaurant in san francisco. i have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. if you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you. the first time we came, we did courses each. we left and we are absolutely stuffed like barely breathing , so ever since we have opted for four. i will start with the service first off, i'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it is empty. secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm. if that is not great service then i do not know what is. lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. when i dine there i truly feel like i am treated like royalty, which is nice when you are dropping a lot of money. then there is the food. i could go on and on but instead i will share my dishes from my most recent visit appetizer the risotto. i'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because i typically go in july every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful. fish roast main lobster with potato puree. hands down my favorite dish with the exception of dessert, which we will get to soon. meat seared filet of beef . good steak. probably my least favorite of the bunch but not because it is not good, the other dishes are just spectacular. cheese they roll out a cart and let you select a few. dessert warm louisiana butter cake. this is no joke. my boyfriend and i literally talk about this more often than people should. hands down the best dessert i've ever had in my life. i would pay for this alone. when you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. overall, you will spend a lot of money but it is so worth it."
242,,Dan L.,1120,5.0,9/3/2018,"the two of us came here for a big anniversary on a weeknight. i had heard about it when it opened long ago and have been wanting to try it. interesting location a couple of blocks off of fisherman's wharf. i liked the option of choosing either a , or course meal , , or . she went with a glutenfree courses, and i went for . the menu had a lot of good choices creative appetizers, fish seafood, meat and game birds. i had glazed oysters topped with caviar, roasted scallops, horseradish crusted salmon, and filet of beef . everything was excellent and the flavors were outstanding. she had risotto with shrimp and seared bass, and she was equally happy, too. i had the lemon souffle cake for dessert and we finished with americanos. the interior is nice, but the seating is a bit cramped. the service was excellent. good wine list, and we ordered a couple of glasses, and they let you even taste them first! i would definitely come back, i do not give very many stars."
243,,Diane L.,1120,3.0,8/21/2018,"i've had this restaurant on my bucketlist for the longest time. went this past sunday since my friend wanted to treat so i could not pass that up. our reservation was for pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. a little behind turned into being a minute wait. the manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. that was a nice gesture, but what would have been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. just my preference vs the free champagne small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons of soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing it was ok. i really wanted to fall in love with this place but it is overhyped for sure. my favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops, seared foie gras, dungeoness crab salad, and all the desserts flambeed cheeries with tres leches cake, lemon souflee cake, and the pineapple cake they give you to take home . the filet of beef was meh the sides on there tasted better and the lemon pepper duck was ok as well, what the heck gary danko maybe my expectations were too high. also, the seared ahi tuna had wayyy too much lemon soy dressing on there. i'm kinda glad i did not have to pay for this meal i did not think it was that worth it to me. such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner i was thinking that i would rather go to house of prime rib lol. overall, i did not come super hungry, but i thought the portions are a little small for my liking. nice presentation and service here, but i think this was just a one time thing for me. for example, it is like seeing someone hot. you just want to hit it and quit it. so basically aka being able to say you went to gary danko to eat just to say you did it."
244,,Cartman P.,1120,5.0,8/4/2018,"gary danko never fails to deliver nothing but perfection, from the food, the presentation, the service, and the atmosphere. where can i begin. food this was our rd or th time we came to gary danko. i am amazed that the quality of food and execution has not changed a bit compared to years ago, which i find it rare in this city. they offer fabulous selection of menu and the only hard part is that you do not know what to order without getting your brains tangled up. this time and i think every time in the past. i had . seared ahi tuna melts like butter and perfectly and lightly flavored with lemon soy dressing. very light and pleasant appetizer to start your meal. . roast main lobster the lobster is perfectly cooked and very plumped, and nicely balanced with smooth potato puree and chanterelle mushrooms. . seared filet of beef the filet was cooked perfect medium rare, tender, buttery, juicy. just everything you ask for in a perfect stake. . last but certainly not least, the one and only, baked chocolate souffle. at this point i am pretty full with plates and a cocktail, but this is the finale what i always look forward to! i love the little presentation from a waiter pouring the two separate sauces in front of you, first with vanilla bean cream and second with dark belgian chocolate sauce. the souffle is incredibly fluffy and soft, never too rich or too sweet, but the sophisticated chocolate flavor will just take you to another world. service the best, top notch, attentive service you can ever ask for. all staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly. last time what i was impressed the most was how attentive they are. they must be a hybrid with hawk, and these eyes are watching you at all time. i spilled the chocolate souffle on my jacket hanging on my legs, and one second later before i even finished saying oh nooooo, someone already flew out to me with cleaning wipes to help me clean. this time, when i arrived at the restaurant i asked for the restroom, and this nice gentleman went out of his way to escort me to the restroom. what a nice gesture to make your visit just even better than perfect. we have tried quince, la folie, alexander. but i think gary danko is my favorite of all time. i absolutely cannot wait to go back again!"
245,,Helen Y.,1120,5.0,7/31/2018,"our friend from the bay area wanted to take us somewhere unique with good food. gary danko did not disappoint from entering the restaurant to drinks at the bar to our meal and dessert. the staff was awesome, always professional and friendly. the ambiance is warm and inviting. the decor is settle and tastefully done. our waiter offered a purse hanger so that i had somewhere to put my handbag while we enjoyed our experience. i started with the rose champagne, a little pricey buy delicious and refreshing. we all ordered the option meal. they have a tasting menu with their most popular items and an option to add wine to each dish. they also have options where you can chose , , or course meal. what you would do is pick a dish from their menu, it can be any combination you would like. my starter was asparagus cold soup to cleanse the palate. then i ordered the risotto with rock shrimp, lobster, and crab meat. delicious!!! the dish was prepared with a wonderful combination of taste and the presentation was beautiful. next i had the thai coconut curry and seafood dish. the curry was super light and tasty as well. then i had the seared filet of beef made medium. this dish was a little disappointing, the meat was over cooked and a little tough. the waiter was very attentive and offered to make me another dish, but i declined because i did not want to waste food. the bread man was always at our table filling out bread plate. upon seeing it, did not look as good as it taste! the bread was warm, soft, and oh so yummy! lastly for dessert i had the butter cake. by now i was quite full and could not finish my dessert, but it was moist and not too sweet. my overall experience at gary danko was a+. i would love to come again next time we are in the bay area."
246,,Eric W.,1120,5.0,6/19/2018,"first time for us at this well known establishment and they did not disappoint. came here for wife's birthday. choose , , or courses from a bevy of options. or, choose the chef's taster option. food was great and staff, from servers to host, was great too. really enjoyed the shrimp crab risotto and sea bass. filet of beef was also delicious. our server prepared a perfect cherry flambe. would definitely recommend and return."
247,,Bailey Z.,1120,4.0,5/30/2018,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains, the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef , which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake. as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."
248,,Andrew C.,1120,4.0,5/24/2018,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "
249,,C Y.,1120,5.0,5/22/2018,"loved it! i came to celebrate a friend's birthday and everything i ordered was solid. the ambiance, service and food were perfection. our party of enjoyed the private dining room that night. courses foie gras since i ordered a dish from each section appetizer, meat, dessert , my foie gras was generously sized. i enjoyed every bite of this! seared filet of beef it was cooked nicely but did not blow my mind. wish i had gone with the duck or lamb. cheesecake delicious! i probably would not have ordered this though had i known about the complimentary assorted minidesserts. conclusion highly recommend! i loved my experience here and cannot wait to try the rest of the menu."
250,,Lala B.,1120,5.0,5/19/2018,"superb. went here on a date, good place to impress a gal. i had the best hostess, my napkin was placed over my lap wink wink lol, and the most tender & juicy seared filet of beef . but definitely try the roast lobster and potato puree, not to big, punches with flavor. for dessert we had an assortment of small tasty delights!"
251,,Annie L.,1120,4.0,5/12/2018,"gary at gary danko! took my boyfriend gary out for his th birthday dinner here as we have been saving this spot for a special occasion. food courses pan seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, garlic confit, tomato and basil roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream we also had the following complimentary dishes special soup from the chef, assorted dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. take home complimentary pineapple cream cheesecake. service great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care of the whole night. however, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members of the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. many times, i had a member of the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. i felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort of taken away. would i come back again i'm willing to give them another try. was i full off of the main courses noi had small scallops and small lobster tails. boyfriend had the beef and we shared the cake. i was filled up off of the butter cake, dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. alot of sweets as fillers but was not full off of the actual courses. would recommend for special occasions, for the ambiance and delicious food."
252,,Holly E.,1120,5.0,4/10/2018,"restaurant gary danko was delicious and you will not leave hungry. we got the three course meal for . i had the risotto with rock shrimp, crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms, roast main lobster, and filet of beef with potato gnocchi. my boyfriend had the coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, and mushrooms, filet of beef , and creme fraiche cheesecake. we had two drinks each and the bill with tip, taxes, and whatever else ca and sf add ended up around . so know what you are getting into before you go so that you do not have a horrible surprise when you leave! i like that you can customize your , , or courses choosing from any section of the menu. meaning, you could get options from the dessert section or filets of beef if you so choose. i'm not a dessert person and was thrilled to not be forced to have that as a course as so many other places do. they will modify the portion sizing depending on what you are ordering. so if you get two appetizers and a filet , the filet will be larger in size than if you were to get two other meat options with the filet . in my opinion, the gnocchi was the best thing i tasted. i would have preferred all gnocchi and no filet ! the steak was okay. my boyfriend who is not as into food as i am raved about the cheesecake and actually called his meal out of this world. a phrase i do not believe i've ever heard him utter. we were happy with the portion sizes its not like the commercial of the couple who go to the fancy restaurant and have to stop at the convenience store on the way home to get more food. but, considering you are paying for each course, you should be full! nice touch to send everyone home with a wonderful pineapple sponge cake for the next day. delicious!! no jacket required for men, but dress up anyways and have a great night out!"
253,,Andrew S.,1120,5.0,4/1/2018,"finally came for an overdue visit to gary danko's. it seems almost impossible to get an opentable reservation at a decent time here so i decided to show up at pm on a sunday as a walkin. i immediately got seated at the bar where they also served the full , or item prix fixe or tasting menu. the food here is solid and french great ingredients transformed into dishes that are perfectly executed. i chose items surf oysters with caviar, branzini , turf seared foie, filet of beef and the perfect dessert lemon souffle cake with mignardises. at the end of the meal, they gave me a small cake to take home. i really appreciate the variety and number of items in their menu i'm a little tired of set tasting menus at the moment . i also like that this restaurant gives you a lot of bread yes i used it to soak up lots of the sauces . tom, the bartender, was the perfect host for my meal. he did a fantastic and fun job making nonalcoholic pairings for me. hospitality was excellent. as for the ambiance, it is very old san francisco probably time for a remodel and the place is a bit dark and feels very dated when compared to the other michelinstarred restaurants in sf. i would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining who is visiting fisherman's wharf. the attire is business casual dark jeans ok but i saw a really good range of clothing when i visited, particularly from tourists who look like they just finished a whole day of sightseeing in sf. i look forward to my next visit to try the other items on the enormous menu."
254,,Janice L.,1120,5.0,3/25/2018,"i want to start off by saying that every single thing i tasted was delicious and well worth what i paid. my boyfriend and i made a last minute attempt to get reservations for our anniversary and were lucky enough to snag a table around pm on a weekday night only days in advance. we arrived a little early and were invited to wait at the bar in the meantime, though we opted not to as the bar area was quite packed that night. speaking of packed, the restaurant is not all that large from what i could tell and so the volume is pretty high, just a fair warning. i honestly do not pay too much attention to service and so i'm just going to skip that and go right into the menu and the food. i really loved the structure of the menu as it allowed my boyfriend and i to try a great variety. you do not have to choose one appetizer, one main, one dessert, etc. if you want to choose all meats go ahead! if you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth and want to order just desserts by all means go for it!! my boyfriend and i each chose a course meal and our selections were oysters, seared foie gras, lobster, duck, quail, & filet of beef we went the meat, meat, and more meat route . the oysters were wonderfully sweet with a beautiful pop of flavor from the caviar. the foie gras was by far my favorite and was not only wonderfully rich, but quite largely portioned as well though not large enough to share with a ravenous boyfriend, i would probably order two of these next time!! . the lobster was flavorful and had an almost buttery texture to it that we really enjoyed this plate would end up being my least favorite though, because i just felt like the other things on the plate did not really complement the lobster . all the meats were incredibly tender and paired well with their accompaniments, especially the quail, and all three were fairly large portions. at the end of the meal, we were treated with an extremely rich chocolate dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary and were also given a small plate of sweets as well as a parting gift a delicious pumpkin and cream cheese muffin . all in all, we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come again!!"
255,,Matt L.,1120,4.0,3/23/2018,"of course, this place is pretty good. but frankly, i think it is a bit overhyped and amazed how hard it was to get a reservation. i went here with a good friend, and we both really enjoyed the seared ahi tuna with avocada as well as the filet of beef . the presentation and service were also top notch."
256,,Diana A.,1120,5.0,2/26/2018,"i always tell my kids you know you are at a fancy restaurant when they sweep the crumbs off the table. well kids they definitely sweep them off here! gary danko happened to be at the top of my list on my recent foodie trip to sf. i have heard of people making reservations months in advance with some only getting a pm time slot. however, luck was on my side when the concierge at the ritz carlton scored me a reservation same day with a pm time slot!!! i wanted my kids to experience their first michelin star restaurant so i could not be more thrilled! we arrived much earlier than our reservation but they took us anyway. we had a nice table at the main dining area where the bar is. i would say the tables are close but not so close you can hear the conversations nearby. the ordering system is pretty simple. you can pick any items from the menu. you have the freedom to choose anything you want.if you want desserts or even steaks you can order just that! my two cents order mainly fish meats and skip the desserts. they will give you a free sampler of mini desserts at the end and a complimentary one you are celebrating a special occasion. they also give everyone a free small soup. just things to keep in mind before ordering. here are the items i ordered seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples i have never tried duck liver before. to me it just tasted like a super buttery piece of fat. it was not exciting. pan seared bass with israeli couscous, broccoli, glazed turnips and radish if bass is on the menu i will always order it. however this one was a bit more stiff to my liking. i prefer the bass that is delicate and melts in your mouth. nonetheless it was still good. seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter i ordered this for my kids as they love steak. they enjoyed it but it is not something i would have ordered. herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula my favorite dish of the evening! the lamb was deliciously tender and moist. the dates added a bit of sweetness. with over items on the menu it was tough picking just ! i am looking forward to coming back to try different items on the menu. this is one of the more reasonably priced michelin star restaurants i have dined at. if you do not order alcohol you can easily have an affordable nice dining experience here. service is perfect as expected. you have about people waiting on your every move. when you leave to use the restroom your napkin has magically been folded and hanging on your chair when you return. they even provide purse holders for the ladies. do not forget to take home the muffins they give you at end. seriously the best you will ever have! tasted perfect with my morning coffee! thank you gary danko! this was definitely the highlight on our trip to sf!"
257,,Sydney C.,1120,4.0,2/19/2018,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster, seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
258,,Elise F.,1120,5.0,2/3/2018,"our experience here was excellent from beginning to the end! loved it! i've been wanting to come here for awhile now and i finally went. my boyfriend and i had a reservation on a friday night at pm. luckily, we were able to find a parking spot right across ghirardelli square which is about a minute walk to the restaurant. if you are not able to find parking, this restaurant does valet for . we arrived minutes early for our reservation but got seated right away. service is on point here! they do not rush you to order, they constantly refill your water without having to ask, refill bread on your plate once you run out, and change your utensils each time a new course comes out even if you did not use the utensils . the meals are set from courses , courses or courses . the food is set by appetizers , fish and seafood , meat and game birds , cheese , and dessert . you can choose the food you want from any section. they start you off with a soup before your courses. my boyfriend and i went with the courses. the food we got were appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, root vegetables, sage and beech mushrooms fish and seafood seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers, potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette meats and game birds seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula dessert baked chocolate souffle with two sauces we enjoyed every bite of our food! the food was cooked perfectly and had nice presentations to them. after we finished our food, they gave us a plate of little yummy treats. since it was my birthday, they also gave a complimentary dessert. i think it was lemon cake, not too sure but it was good! after that, we got another complimentary thing which was banana cream cheese bread to eat for breakfast. everything was great, we will definitely be back! try this place out if you have not yet. definitely worth it! do not forget to make a reservation in advance!"
259,,Katherine C.,1120,5.0,1/24/2018,"alright, this is going to be a long review, but mainly because i have to discuss every aspect. me and my bf did the course meal, because we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we do not get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. most people would probably do fine with the courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. before i forget valet parking is but you can definitely find street parking nearby although it may be a limit of hours in terms of menu items seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples !!!! omg this was the tastiest thing i have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. it was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things i picked risotto with rock shrimp . i'm not sure if i'm a fan of risotto, i may not be as i thought this was a little salty. my bf however thought it was really really good! seared scallops !! these scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. i felt like i was eating a meal from hells kitchen lol. there was also this thing in the middle that i could not tell what it was, some sort of potato cake it was super good too. i could not exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you are going here. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce the salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good because it was not dry like other salmons you would have at other restaurants. i like dill so i automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. i enjoyed the scallops more though. roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo !!! this was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! i thought the quail would be too much work but it was not and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!! lemon pepper duck breast with pears the duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf because it felt like it did not go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway lol. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. i think if the crabcake did not throw me off i would have given this a though. herb crusted loin of lamb with dates this was a lot better than i was thinking! i do not like lamb much but this dish did not taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here. seared filet of beef with gnocci both me and my bf did not really enjoy this too much, but i think its because we realized we do not like filet . it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that is about it. flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it is an extra but definitely worth it. grand marnier souffle this did not impress me and i guess it just felt like too much egg white or maybe i just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much lol so i would recommend the other desserts. espresso martini this was definitely a unique drink that i recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini. besides the food, even though i did not think every dish was , service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and that was enough for me to give on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around but that was mainly bc we got drinks and got the course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job! overall get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"
260,,Faye M.,1120,5.0,10/24/2018,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef , stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
261,,Lindsey S.,1120,5.0,9/6/2018,"gary danko is hands down my favorite restaurant in san francisco. i have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. if you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you. the first time we came, we did courses each. we left and we are absolutely stuffed like barely breathing , so ever since we have opted for four. i will start with the service first off, i'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it is empty. secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm. if that is not great service then i do not know what is. lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. when i dine there i truly feel like i am treated like royalty, which is nice when you are dropping a lot of money. then there is the food. i could go on and on but instead i will share my dishes from my most recent visit appetizer the risotto. i'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because i typically go in july every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful. fish roast main lobster with potato puree. hands down my favorite dish with the exception of dessert, which we will get to soon. meat seared filet of beef . good steak. probably my least favorite of the bunch but not because it is not good, the other dishes are just spectacular. cheese they roll out a cart and let you select a few. dessert warm louisiana butter cake. this is no joke. my boyfriend and i literally talk about this more often than people should. hands down the best dessert i've ever had in my life. i would pay for this alone. when you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. overall, you will spend a lot of money but it is so worth it."
262,,Dan L.,1120,5.0,9/3/2018,"the two of us came here for a big anniversary on a weeknight. i had heard about it when it opened long ago and have been wanting to try it. interesting location a couple of blocks off of fisherman's wharf. i liked the option of choosing either a , or course meal , , or . she went with a glutenfree courses, and i went for . the menu had a lot of good choices creative appetizers, fish seafood, meat and game birds. i had glazed oysters topped with caviar, roasted scallops, horseradish crusted salmon, and filet of beef . everything was excellent and the flavors were outstanding. she had risotto with shrimp and seared bass, and she was equally happy, too. i had the lemon souffle cake for dessert and we finished with americanos. the interior is nice, but the seating is a bit cramped. the service was excellent. good wine list, and we ordered a couple of glasses, and they let you even taste them first! i would definitely come back, i do not give very many stars."
263,,Diane L.,1120,3.0,8/21/2018,"i've had this restaurant on my bucketlist for the longest time. went this past sunday since my friend wanted to treat so i could not pass that up. our reservation was for pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. a little behind turned into being a minute wait. the manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. that was a nice gesture, but what would have been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. just my preference vs the free champagne small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons of soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing it was ok. i really wanted to fall in love with this place but it is overhyped for sure. my favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops, seared foie gras, dungeoness crab salad, and all the desserts flambeed cheeries with tres leches cake, lemon souflee cake, and the pineapple cake they give you to take home . the filet of beef was meh the sides on there tasted better and the lemon pepper duck was ok as well, what the heck gary danko maybe my expectations were too high. also, the seared ahi tuna had wayyy too much lemon soy dressing on there. i'm kinda glad i did not have to pay for this meal i did not think it was that worth it to me. such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner i was thinking that i would rather go to house of prime rib lol. overall, i did not come super hungry, but i thought the portions are a little small for my liking. nice presentation and service here, but i think this was just a one time thing for me. for example, it is like seeing someone hot. you just want to hit it and quit it. so basically aka being able to say you went to gary danko to eat just to say you did it."
264,,Cartman P.,1120,5.0,8/4/2018,"gary danko never fails to deliver nothing but perfection, from the food, the presentation, the service, and the atmosphere. where can i begin. food this was our rd or th time we came to gary danko. i am amazed that the quality of food and execution has not changed a bit compared to years ago, which i find it rare in this city. they offer fabulous selection of menu and the only hard part is that you do not know what to order without getting your brains tangled up. this time and i think every time in the past. i had . seared ahi tuna melts like butter and perfectly and lightly flavored with lemon soy dressing. very light and pleasant appetizer to start your meal. . roast main lobster the lobster is perfectly cooked and very plumped, and nicely balanced with smooth potato puree and chanterelle mushrooms. . seared filet of beef the filet was cooked perfect medium rare, tender, buttery, juicy. just everything you ask for in a perfect stake. . last but certainly not least, the one and only, baked chocolate souffle. at this point i am pretty full with plates and a cocktail, but this is the finale what i always look forward to! i love the little presentation from a waiter pouring the two separate sauces in front of you, first with vanilla bean cream and second with dark belgian chocolate sauce. the souffle is incredibly fluffy and soft, never too rich or too sweet, but the sophisticated chocolate flavor will just take you to another world. service the best, top notch, attentive service you can ever ask for. all staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly. last time what i was impressed the most was how attentive they are. they must be a hybrid with hawk, and these eyes are watching you at all time. i spilled the chocolate souffle on my jacket hanging on my legs, and one second later before i even finished saying oh nooooo, someone already flew out to me with cleaning wipes to help me clean. this time, when i arrived at the restaurant i asked for the restroom, and this nice gentleman went out of his way to escort me to the restroom. what a nice gesture to make your visit just even better than perfect. we have tried quince, la folie, alexander. but i think gary danko is my favorite of all time. i absolutely cannot wait to go back again!"
265,,Helen Y.,1120,5.0,7/31/2018,"our friend from the bay area wanted to take us somewhere unique with good food. gary danko did not disappoint from entering the restaurant to drinks at the bar to our meal and dessert. the staff was awesome, always professional and friendly. the ambiance is warm and inviting. the decor is settle and tastefully done. our waiter offered a purse hanger so that i had somewhere to put my handbag while we enjoyed our experience. i started with the rose champagne, a little pricey buy delicious and refreshing. we all ordered the option meal. they have a tasting menu with their most popular items and an option to add wine to each dish. they also have options where you can chose , , or course meal. what you would do is pick a dish from their menu, it can be any combination you would like. my starter was asparagus cold soup to cleanse the palate. then i ordered the risotto with rock shrimp, lobster, and crab meat. delicious!!! the dish was prepared with a wonderful combination of taste and the presentation was beautiful. next i had the thai coconut curry and seafood dish. the curry was super light and tasty as well. then i had the seared filet of beef made medium. this dish was a little disappointing, the meat was over cooked and a little tough. the waiter was very attentive and offered to make me another dish, but i declined because i did not want to waste food. the bread man was always at our table filling out bread plate. upon seeing it, did not look as good as it taste! the bread was warm, soft, and oh so yummy! lastly for dessert i had the butter cake. by now i was quite full and could not finish my dessert, but it was moist and not too sweet. my overall experience at gary danko was a+. i would love to come again next time we are in the bay area."
266,,Eric W.,1120,5.0,6/19/2018,"first time for us at this well known establishment and they did not disappoint. came here for wife's birthday. choose , , or courses from a bevy of options. or, choose the chef's taster option. food was great and staff, from servers to host, was great too. really enjoyed the shrimp crab risotto and sea bass. filet of beef was also delicious. our server prepared a perfect cherry flambe. would definitely recommend and return."
267,,Bailey Z.,1120,4.0,5/30/2018,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains, the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef , which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake. as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."
268,,Andrew C.,1120,4.0,5/24/2018,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "

272,,Holly E.,1120,5.0,4/10/2018,"restaurant gary danko was delicious and you will not leave hungry. we got the three course meal for . i had the risotto with rock shrimp, crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms, roast main lobster, and filet of beef with potato gnocchi. my boyfriend had the coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, and mushrooms, filet of beef , and creme fraiche cheesecake. we had two drinks each and the bill with tip, taxes, and whatever else ca and sf add ended up around . so know what you are getting into before you go so that you do not have a horrible surprise when you leave! i like that you can customize your , , or courses choosing from any section of the menu. meaning, you could get options from the dessert section or filets of beef if you so choose. i'm not a dessert person and was thrilled to not be forced to have that as a course as so many other places do. they will modify the portion sizing depending on what you are ordering. so if you get two appetizers and a filet , the filet will be larger in size than if you were to get two other meat options with the filet . in my opinion, the gnocchi was the best thing i tasted. i would have preferred all gnocchi and no filet ! the steak was okay. my boyfriend who is not as into food as i am raved about the cheesecake and actually called his meal out of this world. a phrase i do not believe i've ever heard him utter. we were happy with the portion sizes its not like the commercial of the couple who go to the fancy restaurant and have to stop at the convenience store on the way home to get more food. but, considering you are paying for each course, you should be full! nice touch to send everyone home with a wonderful pineapple sponge cake for the next day. delicious!! no jacket required for men, but dress up anyways and have a great night out!"
273,,Andrew S.,1120,5.0,4/1/2018,"finally came for an overdue visit to gary danko's. it seems almost impossible to get an opentable reservation at a decent time here so i decided to show up at pm on a sunday as a walkin. i immediately got seated at the bar where they also served the full , or item prix fixe or tasting menu. the food here is solid and french great ingredients transformed into dishes that are perfectly executed. i chose items surf oysters with caviar, branzini , turf seared foie, filet of beef and the perfect dessert lemon souffle cake with mignardises. at the end of the meal, they gave me a small cake to take home. i really appreciate the variety and number of items in their menu i'm a little tired of set tasting menus at the moment . i also like that this restaurant gives you a lot of bread yes i used it to soak up lots of the sauces . tom, the bartender, was the perfect host for my meal. he did a fantastic and fun job making nonalcoholic pairings for me. hospitality was excellent. as for the ambiance, it is very old san francisco probably time for a remodel and the place is a bit dark and feels very dated when compared to the other michelinstarred restaurants in sf. i would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining who is visiting fisherman's wharf. the attire is business casual dark jeans ok but i saw a really good range of clothing when i visited, particularly from tourists who look like they just finished a whole day of sightseeing in sf. i look forward to my next visit to try the other items on the enormous menu."
274,,Janice L.,1120,5.0,3/25/2018,"i want to start off by saying that every single thing i tasted was delicious and well worth what i paid. my boyfriend and i made a last minute attempt to get reservations for our anniversary and were lucky enough to snag a table around pm on a weekday night only days in advance. we arrived a little early and were invited to wait at the bar in the meantime, though we opted not to as the bar area was quite packed that night. speaking of packed, the restaurant is not all that large from what i could tell and so the volume is pretty high, just a fair warning. i honestly do not pay too much attention to service and so i'm just going to skip that and go right into the menu and the food. i really loved the structure of the menu as it allowed my boyfriend and i to try a great variety. you do not have to choose one appetizer, one main, one dessert, etc. if you want to choose all meats go ahead! if you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth and want to order just desserts by all means go for it!! my boyfriend and i each chose a course meal and our selections were oysters, seared foie gras, lobster, duck, quail, & filet of beef we went the meat, meat, and more meat route . the oysters were wonderfully sweet with a beautiful pop of flavor from the caviar. the foie gras was by far my favorite and was not only wonderfully rich, but quite largely portioned as well though not large enough to share with a ravenous boyfriend, i would probably order two of these next time!! . the lobster was flavorful and had an almost buttery texture to it that we really enjoyed this plate would end up being my least favorite though, because i just felt like the other things on the plate did not really complement the lobster . all the meats were incredibly tender and paired well with their accompaniments, especially the quail, and all three were fairly large portions. at the end of the meal, we were treated with an extremely rich chocolate dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary and were also given a small plate of sweets as well as a parting gift a delicious pumpkin and cream cheese muffin . all in all, we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come again!!"
275,,Matt L.,1120,4.0,3/23/2018,"of course, this place is pretty good. but frankly, i think it is a bit overhyped and amazed how hard it was to get a reservation. i went here with a good friend, and we both really enjoyed the seared ahi tuna with avocada as well as the filet of beef . the presentation and service were also top notch."
276,,Diana A.,1120,5.0,2/26/2018,"i always tell my kids you know you are at a fancy restaurant when they sweep the crumbs off the table. well kids they definitely sweep them off here! gary danko happened to be at the top of my list on my recent foodie trip to sf. i have heard of people making reservations months in advance with some only getting a pm time slot. however, luck was on my side when the concierge at the ritz carlton scored me a reservation same day with a pm time slot!!! i wanted my kids to experience their first michelin star restaurant so i could not be more thrilled! we arrived much earlier than our reservation but they took us anyway. we had a nice table at the main dining area where the bar is. i would say the tables are close but not so close you can hear the conversations nearby. the ordering system is pretty simple. you can pick any items from the menu. you have the freedom to choose anything you want.if you want desserts or even steaks you can order just that! my two cents order mainly fish meats and skip the desserts. they will give you a free sampler of mini desserts at the end and a complimentary one you are celebrating a special occasion. they also give everyone a free small soup. just things to keep in mind before ordering. here are the items i ordered seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples i have never tried duck liver before. to me it just tasted like a super buttery piece of fat. it was not exciting. pan seared bass with israeli couscous, broccoli, glazed turnips and radish if bass is on the menu i will always order it. however this one was a bit more stiff to my liking. i prefer the bass that is delicate and melts in your mouth. nonetheless it was still good. seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter i ordered this for my kids as they love steak. they enjoyed it but it is not something i would have ordered. herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula my favorite dish of the evening! the lamb was deliciously tender and moist. the dates added a bit of sweetness. with over items on the menu it was tough picking just ! i am looking forward to coming back to try different items on the menu. this is one of the more reasonably priced michelin star restaurants i have dined at. if you do not order alcohol you can easily have an affordable nice dining experience here. service is perfect as expected. you have about people waiting on your every move. when you leave to use the restroom your napkin has magically been folded and hanging on your chair when you return. they even provide purse holders for the ladies. do not forget to take home the muffins they give you at end. seriously the best you will ever have! tasted perfect with my morning coffee! thank you gary danko! this was definitely the highlight on our trip to sf!"
277,,Sydney C.,1120,4.0,2/19/2018,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster, seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
278,,Elise F.,1120,5.0,2/3/2018,"our experience here was excellent from beginning to the end! loved it! i've been wanting to come here for awhile now and i finally went. my boyfriend and i had a reservation on a friday night at pm. luckily, we were able to find a parking spot right across ghirardelli square which is about a minute walk to the restaurant. if you are not able to find parking, this restaurant does valet for . we arrived minutes early for our reservation but got seated right away. service is on point here! they do not rush you to order, they constantly refill your water without having to ask, refill bread on your plate once you run out, and change your utensils each time a new course comes out even if you did not use the utensils . the meals are set from courses , courses or courses . the food is set by appetizers , fish and seafood , meat and game birds , cheese , and dessert . you can choose the food you want from any section. they start you off with a soup before your courses. my boyfriend and i went with the courses. the food we got were appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, root vegetables, sage and beech mushrooms fish and seafood seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers, potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette meats and game birds seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula dessert baked chocolate souffle with two sauces we enjoyed every bite of our food! the food was cooked perfectly and had nice presentations to them. after we finished our food, they gave us a plate of little yummy treats. since it was my birthday, they also gave a complimentary dessert. i think it was lemon cake, not too sure but it was good! after that, we got another complimentary thing which was banana cream cheese bread to eat for breakfast. everything was great, we will definitely be back! try this place out if you have not yet. definitely worth it! do not forget to make a reservation in advance!"
279,,Katherine C.,1120,5.0,1/24/2018,"alright, this is going to be a long review, but mainly because i have to discuss every aspect. me and my bf did the course meal, because we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we do not get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. most people would probably do fine with the courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. before i forget valet parking is but you can definitely find street parking nearby although it may be a limit of hours in terms of menu items seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples !!!! omg this was the tastiest thing i have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. it was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things i picked risotto with rock shrimp . i'm not sure if i'm a fan of risotto, i may not be as i thought this was a little salty. my bf however thought it was really really good! seared scallops !! these scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. i felt like i was eating a meal from hells kitchen lol. there was also this thing in the middle that i could not tell what it was, some sort of potato cake it was super good too. i could not exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you are going here. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce the salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good because it was not dry like other salmons you would have at other restaurants. i like dill so i automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. i enjoyed the scallops more though. roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo !!! this was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! i thought the quail would be too much work but it was not and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!! lemon pepper duck breast with pears the duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf because it felt like it did not go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway lol. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. i think if the crabcake did not throw me off i would have given this a though. herb crusted loin of lamb with dates this was a lot better than i was thinking! i do not like lamb much but this dish did not taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here. seared filet of beef with gnocci both me and my bf did not really enjoy this too much, but i think its because we realized we do not like filet . it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that is about it. flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it is an extra but definitely worth it. grand marnier souffle this did not impress me and i guess it just felt like too much egg white or maybe i just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much lol so i would recommend the other desserts. espresso martini this was definitely a unique drink that i recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini. besides the food, even though i did not think every dish was , service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and that was enough for me to give on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around but that was mainly bc we got drinks and got the course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job! overall get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"
280,,Lindsey S.,1120,5.0,9/6/2018,"gary danko is hands down my favorite restaurant in san francisco. i have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. if you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you. the first time we came, we did courses each. we left and we are absolutely stuffed like barely breathing , so ever since we have opted for four. i will start with the service first off, i'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it is empty. secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm . if that is not great service then i do not know what is. lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. when i dine there i truly feel like i am treated like royalty, which is nice when you are dropping a lot of money. then there is the food. i could go on and on but instead i will share my dishes from my most recent visit appetizer the risotto. i'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because i typically go in july every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful. fish roast main lobster with potato puree. hands down my favorite dish with the exception of dessert, which we will get to soon. meat seared filet of beef. good steak. probably my least favorite of the bunch but not because it is not good, the other dishes are just spectacular. cheese they roll out a cart and let you select a few. dessert warm louisiana butter cake . this is no joke. my boyfriend and i literally talk about this more often than people should. hands down the best dessert i've ever had in my life. i would pay for this alone. when you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. overall, you will spend a lot of money but it is so worth it."
281,,Marjolein v.,1120,5.0,8/19/2018,"what an incredible experience, start to finish. the service, the food, the ambiance, everything was nothing short of amazing. even if i wanted to i could not think of one negative thing to say. from the second we walked in we were treated like royalty. i could not imagine a better place to celebrate my birthday. my husband ordered the seared ahi tuna, the pork tenderloin, a selection of cheeses and the louisiana butter cake . all delicious according to him, i would not know because he ate it all before i could steal a bite! good sign. i myself had the corn soup, beef filet, and treated myself to two desserts hey, i'm pregnant what else is a girl to do . the trio of creme brulee was great. the proverbial cherry on top however were the flambeed cherries on tres leches cake , pun intended. the whole restaurant stopped eating to enjoy the show, when our waiter brought over a special grill cart to flambe the cherries right at our table. yes, this place is definitely pricy. is it worth it however every last penny if you ask me."
282,,Jeremy R.,1120,5.0,6/18/2018,"so firstly, why no pictures of the food, you might ask , and i would say that i really had nothing material to add to all that already exists on yelp. what really made the evening memorable, as much as the food, was the care and attention given to our service. yes the food was amazing, but you already knew that. we had oysters with caviar, lobster, duck, bison, quail, scallops, softshell crab, risotto, bronzini, thai seafood curry, lemon semifreddo and louisiana butter cake . each dish was spectacular, unique, perfectly prepared and presented. the only disappointment was the signature chocolate souffle with two sauces which was a little soupy. we had called a few days before or reservation and let the restaurant know that we were celebrating our daughter's college graduation. not only did they write a congratulatory message on the semifreddo plate and put a candle in it, they went so far as to print a personalized menu with a the occasion on it. so sweet and amazing. the whole experience was a . our server jared was amazingly attentive, friendly and informative as was every person who provided service to our table. in a town of hipster restaurants, some quite excellent, it is refreshing to dine at a restaurant where the dining experience is as important as the food. thank you gary danko for making our special evening truly special!"
283,,Bailey Z.,1120,4.0,5/30/2018,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains, the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef, which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake . as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."

285,,Lindsay H.,1120,4.0,4/20/2018,the service was good and the food is good but not as good as i expected. i had better souffle at other places.the warm louisiana butter cake is pretty good. the duck is not juicy enough for median rare and the i do not like the fried branzini. the price is fair.
286,,Sharon Q.,1120,4.0,1/30/2017,"came here for our th year wedding anniversary! my only disappointment was the valet guy. he was on his phone and we had to walk over to him and be the first one to say something before he looked up and took our keys. slightly disappointing first impression and not sure if they outsource their valet service. but when we actually walked in.everything went uphill from there. the host took my coat and seated us promptly. we met our waitress, suzanne, right away and was given a good explanation of their menu and items. my husband and i both opted for the course dinner and we chose the following for winfred seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples roast maine lobster with potato puree, white beech mushrooms, edamame and tarragon roasted pork tenderloin and belly with butternut squash puree, apples, chestnuts and bacon flambeed pineapple upside down cake with almonds and vanilla ice cream. for me dungeness crab salad with mango, hearts of palm, lolla rossa, and madras curry vinaigrette risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, squash and shimeji mushrooms roasted quail stuffed with mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa and foie gras with fingerling potatoes and porcini cream warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream. every dish was delicious and exquisite but my top favorites are the foie gras, the risotto, and the warm louisiana butter cake . another thing i wanted to point out its a great place to celebrate and they have such wonderful service from start entering the door to end."

288,,Grace L.,1120,5.0,11/28/2016,"gary danko. what more is there to say with more than reviews and it being stars my husband and i came here to celebrate our year wedding anniversary and it was absolute perfection. we ordered the four course meal and it was the right amount for each of us. as an appetizer we tried the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, pumpkin, shimeji mushrooms and sage and the dungeness crab salad with melons, cucumbers, roasted eggplant and thai mango dressing. both were great starters to our meal. for our fish and seafood selection we went with the pan seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, garlic confit, tomato and basil and roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, edamame and tarragon. so good! with our meat and game selection lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and cardamom poached pears and the seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter . i highly recommend the lemon pepper duck breast i've never tasted anything like it and it was delicious! and finally for our dessert, we shared the lemon souffle cake with creme fraiche panna cotta and raspberry sorbet and the warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream. both were excellent ways to end our fantastic meal. gary danko. you deserve a million gold stars!"
289,,Pierre B.,1120,5.0,9/16/2016,"absolutely amazing. this is definitely a top food experience of my life. my wife and i each ordered the five course meal. even though we were totally stuffed afterwards, we simply would not have been able to forego any of the courses, they were each so unforgettable. each of my courses seared ahi seared scallops bison steak cheese plate and louisiana butter cake and my wife's courses poached farm egg with sweetbreads lobster duck breast cheese plate and peanut butter bar were each completely different but completely excellent in their own way. every ingredient in each perfectly complemented the other. we have never had better cheeses we each asked the waiter to surprise us from their selection of cheeses , even at a michelin starred restaurant in paris. the only very minor negative was the decor. it is oldfashioned, dark and and little foreboding."
290,,Jesse P.,1120,5.0,6/7/2016,"took my wife here for our anniversary and we had a nice experience. the staff was all very friendly though one kid who was pouring water looked like he was scared to death of making a mistake. i kind of felt bad for him. the only issue with the staff i had was at times they would reach over me in an awkward way. the food was really good but what blew me away was the portion size. i'm used to tasting menus being small items, just a few bites. for instance i ordered the horseradish encrusted salmon medallion. seeing medallion i was expecting a very small bite or two. when it arrived it was a significant piece of meat. we also had the filet, risotto, cheese selection, and warm louisiana cake . the risotto was hands down the highlight of the night. so creamy and the flavors were fantastic. i would love to go back for more bowls of that. the filet was good but it is not my favorite cut of beef. still very good. my wife absolutely loved the louisiana cake recommended by the staff. i opted to have our waitress choose the cheeses for me and she brought everything i love, it was fantastic. my only regret was i ate too much and was so full i could not finish the cheese. the portion sizes are huge and i must say for what you are paying for everything i felt like it was a great deal, so worth the money."
291,,Monica W.,1120,5.0,3/27/2016,"my boyfriend and i made reservations months ahead and yet the only available time that was available for our anniversary was at pm. let me first off by saying you real need to make reservations ahead of time right when the times rolls around otherwise you will not be able to get reservations the week of. it was packed when we arrived. parking was not too bad for us luckily. we found meter parking by ghirardelli. we got here around pm, the doorman opened the door for us and here we were at gary danko. the hostess took my coat and told us to wait by the bar since our table was not ready yet. my boyfriend and i ordered non alcoholic drink and they were tasty. i cannot remember what they were but my boyfriend's drink had some sparkling orange drink and i had some lemon daiquiri. it was around and the host came to get us and told us the table was ready. we were seated and gave us the menu. the waiter was super attentive, nice, funny and handsome! my bf and i had the course meal. it was around per person and it was worth it. my bf ordered the ahi tuna appetizer , seabass, seared filet beef, and the louisiana butter cake . for me, i had the risotto with shrimp, roast main lobster, pork belly and then the creme brulee! all of our dishes were just fabulous. my risotto was just perfect and tasty. lobster was on point and juicy. the meat just came right off the she will. pork belly was chewy and tasty. the trio creme brulee was perfect and it came with different cookies. service was great. the waiter came by to check on us every so often. cannot forget about the water guy. he came around refilling our water plenty of times lol which was nice. everyone who works here was super nice and caring. at the end, when our desserts came out, the waiter came back again and gave us a chocolate cake with some small sweets. it was such a lovely gesture and they even wrote happy anniversary on the plate. i did not think they would actually treat us by doing all this even though i wrote on the note section when making the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary but did not expect this!! you guys are awesome! finally after receiving our check, they gave us each banana cheesecake to bring home. i have not ate it yet but i will tomorrow but i'm sure it would be good. i cannot wait to come back here again!!!!"
292,,Joy W.,1120,5.0,2/17/2016,"i came here a few years ago and still have fond memories of the meal. dinner was excellent & service was exquisite. though some ingredients have changed, the classic menu remains fundamentally unchanged. it can be difficult getting a reservation. you cannot make a reservation on opentable. you must call or email, & get a confirmation number. reservations cannot be made more than two months in advance. needless to say, plan ahead. we had reservations, but somehow the hostess had us down for a different time. mistakes happen, but it seemed like she thought we were at fault. i guess it is always best to confirm reservations a day prior to showing up to the restaurant. no matter, we were seated not too long afterwards. the restaurant is rather dark & cozy. a little too cozy as we audibly heard a neighboring diner who made chide remarks about our allblack attire. it was actually really funny overhearing this. what can i say we did not plan our outfits very well. for the rest of the evening, service was amazing. the servers really make you feel taken care of here. overall, i give gary danko a , w the exception of the reservation discrepancy. you can choose courses from the appetizer, seafood, meat, cheese & dessert menus. the serving sizes are each a very goodsized portion. pricing currently course course course for the most bang for your buck, i encourage you to get steaks for . appetizers seared foie gras w caramelized onions & apples seared to a golden brown & melts in your mouth like butter . it is like eating straight up fat, but ohsogood anyway. the caramelized onions & apples add sweet & tart flavors to cut through the heavy richness of the foie gras. crispy farm egg w grits, royal trumpet mushrooms, frisee who does not love a poached egg got the image in your head now take that poached egg, bread it, fry it, & serve it over some greens. i always find it so satisfying to break into runny egg yolk. a little egg yolk over frisee actually makes a pretty nice dressing. risotto w lobster, gulf shrimp, shimeji mushrooms & butternut squash creamy w big chunks of lobster & shrimp spread throughout. the consistency of the rice was a little more broken up than i am used to for risotto. seafood roast maine lobster w potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, corn & tarragon chunks of claw meat resting in the she will, adorned w a sprig of tarragon that looks like it is growing out of the lobster. seared tuna w peppers & onions mildly flavored strips of tuna over a light sauce. it was an interesting combination, but not the most memorable tuna i've had. meat seared filet of beef w cremini mushrooms, braised shallots & potato cake beautifully petite filet cooked to a pinkinthecenter medium rare over a sweet & savory sauce, accompanied w a breaded & fried potato cake . the current beef filet comes with a rich & creamy square of potato gratin. roast quail stuffed w mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa, foie gras, on ham hocks & maitake w corn cake one of the better quail dishes i've had. quail tends to be dry, but the stuffing enhances the flavors & juices of the bird. the corn cake was topped w corn salsa. dessert baked chocolate souffle w sauces it was beautifully presented. the server poured the the chocolate & custard sauces into the center of the souffle w ease. i wish i had captured a photo prior to the sauces being applied to the souffle. the texture was light, yet creamy, but the tasted so rich. warm louisiana butter cake w apples, huckleberry compote &vanilla bean ice cream i did not think butter cake sounded too interesting, but it was still delicious w baked apple slices on top for fruity sweetness. the huckleberry compote added some acidity to the overall rich & buttery dessert. complimentary dessert assortment little tea cookies, brownies, fruit jellies & things as if we did not already consume enough dessert, we were also presented w a little cheesecake topped w raspberry & a single elongated candle to celebrate our special occasion. last but not least, we were given their signature complimentary takeout dessert, which i believe is a souffle, but i'm not sure i never got to open it. had i known we were going to be consuming so many sweet desserts, i might have gone w the artisanal cheeses presented tableside. the dishes that really stood out to me were the crispy farm egg, lobster risotto, & chocolate souffle. if i came back, i would definitely like to try the oysters w caviar. though pricey, i would say gary danko's prices pale in comparison to many other fine dining establishments. it is a wonderful restaurant to dip your toes into the fine dining pool."
293,,Tammy N.,1120,5.0,2/14/2016,"make sure to make reservations months in advance! we came here at for our pm reservation & did valet parking for +tip. upon entering, we were greeted by the host, checked in, and waited about minutes until someone else came and took us to our table. we were asked if we wanted a wine or cocktail list & served our choice of water. one of the waiters came by and served us some bread we got unlimited bread without having to ask until our plates were taken away . we ordered moscow mules which were delicious!! it was probably one of the best i've ever had and i order them everywhere i go. so, how it works here is you are given the choice to order a , , or course meal. we originally were going to do the course meal which was an appetizer, a meat course, seafood course, cheese plate, and dessert, but we got too stuffed mid meal so our server took the cheese course off our meal! to start, i ordered the seared foie gras which was amazing. it was perfectly buttery and the sauce that went along with it was perfect and did not overpower the dish. next, i had the coconut thai curry which came with scallops, shrimp, lobster, and calamari over a bed of rice. all of the seafood were cooked to perfection and i liked how they gave you less rice and more seafood. thumbs up to that! and! the scallops were big and not those little skimpy ones. moving forward, i had the filet of beef which came with some potatoes. the filet came cooked to perfectionmedium rare. most times when i ask for medium rare, my steak is still mooing. hello. i do not want to eat a live cow on my plate! lastly, we finished off with our dessert. i had the louisiana butter cake & my boyfriend had the cheesecake and they were both amazing! not too sweet and the ice cream that came with it paired very well. i will definitely be back. awesome food, awesome service."
294,,Aub B.,1120,5.0,12/2/2015,"first time diner at gary danko. was welcomed by an extremely professional and friendly staff. they were all knowledgable and prompt with their service which was very refreshing to experience. i chose the three course menu risotto, seared scallops and louisiana butter cake , all delicious in their own way. might i add, the cheese plate was amazing, you are able to choose four cheeses from about different types. my guest and i were very satisfied and would absolutely return for another dining experience."
295,,Christina S.,1120,5.0,11/22/2015,"what can i say about gary danko that has not been said before i've started to write this review a million times and i have recommended gary danko to friends in text messages longer than any yelp review ever would be. and while i could fill pages with how wonderful the service, atmosphere, and drinks are, i think i will just stick with my favorites from the food. seared foie gras if you are into foie gras, you cannot go wrong with this. you are given way more foie gras then you would get anywhere else. seared sea scallops these may be the best scallops i've ever had. yes, you only get a few, but you will savor every last bite with your eyes closed. lemon pepper duck breast you get a large portion of duck, and it is served with this incredible duck hash as well. for true duck lovers, this is a must have. herb crusted loin of lamb this is a ridiculous, decadent dream. the lamb is so tender and flavorful. warm louisiana butter cake this is my favorite cake that i've ever had, period. it is all crust and warm butter and i would eat this every single day of my life if i would not become enormous. i would celebrate anything at gary danko. i would celebrate the sun rising and setting every day at gary danko. i'm already plotting my next visit."
296,,Ghizal A.,1120,5.0,10/26/2015,"gary danko is an experience, and that is why you should go here. be prepared to spend a pretty penny though. it is a great #treatyoself restaurant, so we celebrated an anniversary here. reservations were made about five weeks in advance for a saturday night. we each opted for the four course meal. together we had the following dishes seared ahi tuna pan seared bass horseradish salmon lamb seared filet of beef cheese plate creme brulee warm louisiana buttercake they were all delicious. the winners were by far the salmon, the lamb, and the buttercake for dessert. everything was good, but these three were outstanding. if i were to visit again i would probably scrap the cheese. it was not bad, but i would opt for an appetizer instead. on top of that because it was an anniversary celebration, they brought out an additional dessert and tray of cookies. everything was so very good! initially with the small portion size i was worried we would not be full, but by the end of it, were were overly stuffed. they sent us home with pumpkin cheesecake for breakfast. the only critique i have is the awkwardness of everybody celebrating something and getting the same dessert. seemed a bit impersonal and staged, particularly if you are the third group in your section to get the congratulations and here you go. not complaining about the free dessert though d."

298,,Carina R.,1120,4.0,9/3/2015,"gary danko. this place has been on my list of places to eat at for forever. so, on my birthday, we had no plans, and i decided that it was time to make reservations. i did call about months before my birthday for reservations and at the time, they had only two spots available or . it is! when we arrived, we were immediately seated at a little table for two that was small, but a good size for me and my hubby. the restaurant is dimly lit which leads to a more quiet, somewhat romantic, and very calm atmosphere. it was really quite lovely. the waiter told us a little about the menu and took our drink order. the wait staff there are all very professional and courteous. definitely a plus for a nice restaurant such as this. my husband and i decided to do courses. for my appetizer, i did the dungeness crab and melon salad. my husband had the corn soup with biscuit. the salad was delicious. the crab tasted fresh and was complimented so well by the melon. my husband's soup was definitely very good. i tried some and it was light but flavorful, and the biscuit floating in the soup soaking up the flavors was perfect to bite into while eating the soup. next was our fish plate. i had the sea scallops and my husband had the soft she will crab. both were, also, very good. however, the sea scallops are literally two scallops with some sauce. while the soft she will crab is a full soft she will crab, with pureed potatoes, and an assortment of vegetables. so, the soft she will crab is more bang for your buck. i love scallops, but that soft she will crab was a better plate in my opinion. then, came our meat plate. i had the pork tenderloin with braised cheek, and my husband had the lamb. we both agreed that our entrees were decent, but not amazing. after our appetizer and fish plate, we were enthusiastically awaiting our entrees. and instead of our overall meal being elevated, it just plateaued, which was a disappointment. do not misunderstand, the meal was good, but the flavors were not as awesome as our first two plates. for my husband's fourth course, he chose the cheese platter. we chose four cheeses a gruyere, a brie, and two goat cheeses that names escape me right now. some of the cheeses were rich and creamy, some were hard and crumbly, but all were full of flavor and wonderful. we enjoyed choosing our cheeses as well as eating them! my last course was dessert and i chose the warm louisiana butter bread with peaches and vanilla ice cream. very good. the only thing about dessert is that after dessert they bring you some small dessert bites, that you possibly do not have any room for, but somehow end up sampling anyways! so, my suggestion would be to go for a lighter dessert, so you can enjoy the small bites, as well. and of course, they sent us home with some pineapple cream cheese cake which we ate the next day with our kid and she loved it! . overall, stars. could have been stars, but the entrees did not quite meet our expectations."
299,,Gail J.,1120,5.0,10/13/2013,"we surprised my motherinlaw by celebrating her birthday gary danko's last night. she has very high standards, but our waiter wowed her just seconds after she opened her menu. the light level was too low for her to read, so presto! he whipped out a lighted magnifier. highlights of our dinner were the pan roasted quail stuffed with cornbread and pancetta, the seared sea scallops, and the pork tenderloin. the preparation was meticulous, but on the salty side for our tastes. in retrospect, i think that if we had mentioned to our attentive waiters that we preferred lower sodium in our meals, that request would have been honored. our strawberry souffle and louisiana butter cake were outstanding! for mom there was a special birthday dessert which pleased her tremendously. her smile as we left with our little packages of pumpkin cream cheese bread told me we made the right choice for her birthday dinner."
300,,Katie L.,1117,4.0,10/22/2018,"this place is always busy and take out takes forever. but their food is so good that i still come back. their chicken wings is a must get. we also ordered the hot and sour soup, shrimp and leek dumplings , beef fried rice, sauteed string beans and the black bean noodles. there was only of eating and had plenty of leftovers but it was just as good the next day for lunch!"
301,,Mike M.,1117,5.0,10/18/2018,"best chinese food in norcal, maybe anywhere. the home made kim chee is the best, then have shrimp and leek dumplings , pork dumplings , or pot stickers. you have never had better. they are home made fillings and noodles. be careful, you have them once and you will have to have them at least once a week! every dish is so flavorful and distinctly different. the yellow curries are awesome. kung pao is amazing. try the black bean homemade noodles or any noodles. chicken wings, garlic chicken, mao pao, dry fried string beans, mu shu, and everything is so special. very crowded for obvious reasons. sometimes the line is down the street. dress warm and bring a beverage to drink while waiting for a table on a friday or saturday night. you will never eat chinese food in san francisco anywhere else again. it is that good!!!! try san tung next door also. that is how good this food is, that they are able to have a second one next door. are you getting it! thank you to the chu family for making eating a heavenly experience! did i mention the sauces are the best in the world! mike mcnair"

307,,Nette T.,1117,4.0,7/4/2018,"i cannot believe i have not written a review of san tung in all my years on yelp! i went here when i was at university.that is how long this place has been around. they are still packed to the gills with people and the wait is still long. my neighbor and i came here on a saturday night and when the uber driver dropped us off she asked it is the restaurant with people waiting on the sidewalk, right !!! you put your name on the whiteboard and make sure you stand near the door because the guy calling out the names can have fatigue so you barely hear your name being called. we finally got seated after a minute wait. their menu is extensive but all you need to remember from all the people raving on yelp is the dry fry chicken wet . we ordered dry fry chicken wet diced this came with a spicy and sweet sauce that was a nice contrast to the perfectly fried chicken. crunchy, spicy and sweet and oh so good. shrimp and leek dumpling little dumplings with ginger, garlic, ground shrimp and chinese chives love these boiled dumplings ! i felt healthy for eating these after the fried chicken. so flavorful and soft and even better when dipped in white vinegar. black bean sauce noodles sliced beef, shrimp and calamari in a dark soybean sauce served over a bowl of fresh homemade noodles this came with sliced cucumbers on top and was nice with the savory and chewy noodles. it is a lot of carbs so we did not eat as much as we wanted. service was efficient and my neighbor enjoyed our dinner here. i'm glad that i'm going back to my old stomping grounds from university and find that they are just as good now as they were back then."
308,,Jasmine B.,1117,5.0,6/11/2018,"i've been dining at san tung probably a decade. the dry fried chicken wings are a dream come true. worth writing your name on the dry erase board and waiting in the wind. i also enjoy the green beans and shrimp and leek dumplings . service is efficient and quick. prices are reasonable. highly recommend if you like chicken wings, so good!"
309,,Hana L.,1117,5.0,6/8/2018,so freaking good. get the dry fried chicken pieces and the green beans! do not waste any money or space in your stomach on anything else the shrimp and leek dumplings were a waste imo . there will be a line but seriously if you are in sf this is a must so go and thank me later.
310,,Shannon H.,1117,4.0,3/5/2018,"yummy yummy fried chicken magic. . do not miss out on the fried chicken. . the potstickers are also super bomb. . absolutely do not miss out on the fried chicken wet or dry but the sauce they put on it is really magic. so this place gets ridiculously crowded for dinner time i've driven past the crowds on the way home but at lunch actually it was not too bad. there was about a min wait while they cleared out a table for our party of two. the place is fairly spacious with lots of room for big parties but they also have some four tops for those that are traveling lighter. we ordered the fried chicken, potstickers on the recommendation of a coworker and fellow yelpers , honey walnut shrimp , and the shrimp and leek dumplings . all really tasty. the honey walnut shrimp is probably pretty standard and i've had better dumplings at other places but these were still pretty good. i would recommend the fried chicken did i say that enough yet and the potstickers if you are at a loss. they have lunch specials and the lunch special fried chicken was pcs as opposed to . they are served wet or dry and i thought we ordered ours dry but they came with a sauce on it. which i would think would be the wet ones either way they were still super good. parking sucks here. it is irving and no matter when you go, it will be pretty tough. meters and some free street parking on the side streets if you are extra lucky."
311,,Cui Cui Z.,1117,3.0,2/11/2018,"wanted to check out the hype here. ordered what seemed to be the most popular items dry fried chicken wings, shrimp and leek dumplings , and black bean sauce noodles. we ordered everything to go, minutes for a to go order so make sure you call ahead. we had to try calling several times as the first two times the answering machine picked up. the dry fried chicken wings were good, tasted like the korean wings. the shrimp and leek dumplings were tasty even without any dipping sauce. the black bean sauce noodles were okay, a little bland. all in all, decent place. would not go out of my way to eat here but if your in the area, it is worth a try."
312,,Steph L.,1117,4.0,2/10/2018,"san tung is my go to place for chicken wings! i went yesterday on a friday night for dinner and the wait was surprisingly short. at around pm, there were only people in front of me on the list. this translated to only a minute wait. oftentimes when i would pass by the restaurant, i would notice a crowd so large that it would have had to be at least an hour wait. i've been coming here for the last years with my family before san tung became very well known to the bay area community. still to this day, i order the same things chicken wings, string beans, shrimp and leek dumplings , deluxe noodle. although everything about my meal was delicious, i noticed compared to before, portions are smaller and everything is a lot sweeter especially the string beans and chicken wings. the string beans and the chicken wings used to actually have a mild spiciness level, but you do not get that anymore."
313,,Tori G.,1117,4.0,1/27/2018,"i'm not sure if it was because i gave into the massive amount of hype san tungs had, but after finishing my meal i was a bit disappointed in the quality and taste of food they offered at dinner. despite there being people ahead of us when we arrived, the wait went by very fast which was a plus. but take note you only get one chance to be seated once if your name gets called off the wait list, they do not mess around with seating you quickly. so if you do not hear your name called, you are out of luck. we ordered their famous chicken, but we asked for it diced instead of on the bone disappointing. to me the chicken tasted like a less syrupy version of panda express orange chicken , we also ordered a peanut sauce noodle which was amazing, the sauce was rich and well seasoned and the noodles were perfectly cooked in my opinion , we also ordered their green beans which was also decent. it was not as seasoned or oily as other chinese green beans i've eaten, which was a good thing we also got shrimp and leek dumplings the cooks forgot about our dumplings and we did not receive them until after they gave us our bill to leave we had to remind them we ordered it and when we finally did get them, they were tough, over done, and i feel they had too much leek which over powered the rest of the flavor of the dumplings overall san tungs was an okay dining experience. i would not go out of my way to eat here again."
314,,Sarah C.,1117,4.0,1/21/2018,"i do not really like chinese food, which makes this harder. it is a real struggle between three and four. all around they are very much as one would expect a chinese restaurant to be nothing special, but solid american style chinese food except those chicken wings are above par. their dry fried chicken wings are quite good. very nicely fried, and the sauces is pretty tasty although i could have gone spicier maybe if i were not white they would have made them spicier who knows. the other things eh. tasted like chinese food. we got the green beans another chinese dish i can sometimes handle and they were ok but i've definitely had better. we also got fried rice which was fine but did not stand out in anyway. last we got shrimp and leek dumplings , which i did not try, but my husband stays they were standard. they do get busy but they also seat people at their large family tables that do not know each other so that helps."

316,,Ann N.,1117,2.0,11/5/2017,"my friend and i arrived at san tung on july about minutes before it opened. we opted to pay for meter parking since parking is scarce in sf. waiting in line in the cold, i was stoked to ry the famous wings and a few other recommended dishes thanks fellow yelpers. right at am, the doors opened and a full house was seated within minutes. protip come within that first wave of customers to avoid the wait. we ordered the following dishes based on popular reviews dry fried chicken these were supposed to be one of the best wings i will have in my life. i thought they were just slightly above average. maybe the hype was overbuilt for these wings some friends will load a carryon bag with wings to bring back to socal for friends as a souvenir gift from their travels mins north in a plane lol i thought they were just standard wings dressed in an asian sauce. what is so special about that t least the wings were not dry i suppose. shrimp and leek dumplings these came out cold in the middle as if they froze them and did not defrost the dumplings before cooking them. not a fan but props to them for not making the dumpling she will to doughy. black bean paste noodles drenched in black bean paste, i was not sure what i was eating aside from the sauce. wow i must be one of few who have such a bad experience there. i was so disappointed in the quality of the food but i will definitely give this place another try."
317,,Samantha D.,1117,5.0,10/29/2017,"excellent food! everything we ordered was great, i want to order each item on the menu. of course, the original fried chicken was crispy with the best sweet and tangy sauce. the shrimp and leek dumpling were very fresh tasting. the pork chow mein was also worth noting. very large portions at a reasonable price!"
318,,Merica S.,1117,4.0,10/25/2017,"i'm more of a buffalo wild wings kinda gal, but i have to admit that the original dry fried chicken wings from here have me feelin' some type of way. these wings are the numero uno reason to visit. if you are visiting to try other menu items from here, then get the f ck out. just kiddingother somewhat noteworthy things to order include the shrimp and leek dumplings and the dried sauteed green beans. no frills good food. anyway, back to the wings. they come out piping hot, savory n' sweet, and crispy. get ready for some major finger lickin' action. yum."
319,,Diana T.,1117,2.0,9/18/2017,"oh, san tung. i'm sad that this place was over hyped and underwhelming. we came around dinnertime, and luckily there was not a wait. we ordered the famous dry fried chicken, along with the black bean sauce noodles and shrimp and leek dumplings . the black bean sauce noodles were served with slices of beef, shrimp and calamari, and lacked some flavor. i felt like i was eating just flour with the dumplings . last, the dry fried chicken. sure, it was crispy and sticky and gooey, but lacked major flavor. compared to bonchon wings, the flavor here is lacking. but to each their own."
320,,Lena H.,1117,4.0,9/24/2018,the four star review is really just for the original dry fried chicken wings since this is the most popular menu item here and you can see that every table got or orders. the restaurant is packed during lunch and dinner hours so there is always a wait time so i usually order foods togo. i do not find other entrees exceptional besides the dry fried wings . some entrees are very good and some are just average dishes so really depends on what i ordered here. i wish the quality could be more consistent across the menu. expect wait time if you come here.
321,,Julia S.,1117,5.0,9/14/2018,"after reading the reviews, i was expecting a very long wait for lunch. however, when i got there around pm on a friday, i only had to wait a couple minutes before i was seated! the whole restaurant was packed, but the workers were very efficient in cleaning tables and seating the next people on the waitlist. my table got the original dry fried chicken wings , black bean sauce noodles, and potstickers. we came in very hungry, but only ended up finishing the chicken wings and a few potstickers. i personally did not think the noodles and potstickers were anything special, but the fried chicken is something else. i had heard great things about it, and it did not disappoint! i loved the flavor of the sightly spicy coating, and the crunchiness of the skin with the tenderness inside. i would definitely come by again to order more of those!"
322,,Celine L.,1117,4.0,9/3/2018," , + reviews & . stars for fried chicken put this place on the map for my boyfriend and me. upon arriving we saw a large crowd of people waiting outside so my boyfriend dropped me off in front while he went to look for parking. your whole party needs to be here in order to be seated . the whiteboard to write your name is to your right as soon as you enter. put your name down and wait. the place is relatively small, so not much space but i did notice a small separate dining room for a larger party. it was not that long before we were seated maybe minutes i'm pretty patient so wait times do not bother me too much. we ordered orders of the original dry fried chicken not sure why it is called dry because they are the exact opposite. chicken is moist and covered in sauce. the sauce is sweet, tangy, and salty. it has some red pepper flakes in it. reminded me of panda express's orange chicken but better. plus they use drummettes & wings . this is what they are known for and my boyfriend and i were fans! soo good. szechuan roasted duck & buns one of my fave chinese wedding dishes which i had to introduce to my mexican boyfriend. he fell in love! he cleaned the bones and basically ate whole thing by himself. i personally think i've had better but i'm just glad he liked it. the dry black bean noodles were alright. definitely nothing out of this world. the texture of the mushy noodles kind of grossed me out. overall i give this place . stars rounding to . the chicken alone made up for the lack of customer service. the servers were disgruntled and some of the plates and tea cups were dirty. overall i had a great time and we took home leftovers."
323,,Josephine Q.,1117,5.0,8/26/2018,"this was my first time at this restaurant and even on a sunday night for a party of , the wait was almost hrs. i had high expectations for this place so when i visited sf, i knew i had to try it at least once since i was not able to on my prior trip but that was because it was with family and it is rare that the older generation would want to wait this long for food . anyway, i got the shrimp and leek dumplings and it tasted like i could have bought that from the supermarket and made it myself. i also got the black bean sauce noodles which was interesting because i never had it before. then. it was time for the original dry fried chicken wings and wow. those hrs were worth it and my expectations were met! when i come back to visit sf at a future date, i will be sure to return. there will not be any judgment if i only order the dry fried chicken wings , right "
324,,Priscilla P.,1117,4.0,8/19/2018,"i've been to san tung a few times and taken it togo countless of other times. the wait is usually pretty long for the weekend. i would say anywhere between an hour to two. if you go about min prior to when they open for dinner you will be able to be seated right away. i saw a large group walk in at opening saying they had reservations but i'm guessing they only take reservations for large parties. recently we ordered the original dry fried chicken , the pork and leek dumplings, the hot and sour soup, the garlic green beans, and the black bean sauce noodles. the original dry fried chicken is great because it has a bit of spice yet a bit of sweetness to it. i would not call it dry exactly though since there is sauce but it is more of a sticky sauce rather than something like buffalo wings . the pork and leek dumplings were not so impressive to me since i felt they were bland and super salty on the inside. i enjoyed the black bean sauce noodles and the garlic green beans. though i did like the hot and sour soup i did notice it tasted very spicy due to a peppery taste it was as if they used a lot of the grey pepper you see in asian restaurants so if you are not into that and a kick of spice then this dish might not be for your. portions are fair for the cost. service can be so so as you would have to wave down the waiters from time to time and maybe multiple times before they catch your attention. i would come back but if the wait is too long i would rather usually just take it to go or door dash it."
325,,James B.,1117,4.0,8/8/2018,"i finally got to try this place after a couple of failed attempts. i came here twice before but they were closed. when i arrived, there was about an hour long wait and i was not about to wait that long, so i just ordered for take out. black bean noodles actually tasted like the korean chinese version. of all the places that i've tried in la, it was probably the best that i've tried so far. original dry chicken wings had a good balance of savory and sweet so it was pretty dang delicious. i can see why everyone who comes here orders this. i do not know why it says dry because it is not dry . it is a bit saucy."
326,,Vinia N.,1117,4.0,7/24/2018,"their food is good, but not the price. my favorite is their original dry fried chicken wings , it has a sweet but salty taste. the dumplings and noodles are also good choices. the one thing that is not the best are the price points. one order of twelve to thirteen wings is . the price point is pricey for the small amount of wings . the wings are also fairly smaller than regular wings ."
327,,Katherine N.,1117,4.0,7/9/2018,"san tung was extremely popular when i lived here about years ago and i am happy to report it is still as popular as ever. i came about mins before closing and i was afraid i would be at the tail end of service. little did i know, there is still a line! they are so packed all the time. the original dry fried chicken wings are as amazing as what everyone else has said. crunchy yet so much sauce and flavor. every bite is heavenly. i also ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings. i was a little disappointed in it to be honest. i almost thought they gave me the wrong order because i did not see any shrimp! there was probably leek shrimp ratio. the dumplings were not terrible, just not what i had wanted."
328,,Andrea S.,1117,5.0,6/28/2018,"the honey glazed original dry fried chicken wings are what everyone gets here! be sure to get here early as there always is a long waiting list. other than the chicken , get the black bean noodles and dumplings or some veggies to complement your wings !"
329,,Luke L.,1117,4.0,6/25/2018,"you know why you are here yup you are here for those legendary chicken wings . the name san tung translates to the word shan dong a province in china and the province is best known for its dumplings. since the province is just one yellow sea away from korea, san tung's menu also have several korean influenced dishes. our group got here minutes before the opening time and the restaurant opened minutes early pm . initially the restaurant was % filled up, but by the time we walked out at pm the restaurant was completely packed. food did take a while to come out + minutes , but service was actually pretty good comparing with other chinese restaurants english friendly menu & waiters spoke good english . five spice beef noodle # sliced five spice beef and tendon in a bowl of fresh homemade soup noodles accompanied with spinach, this was the first beef noodle soup i had with broth that contains pieces of ginger, but broth had an interesting aroma and tasted slightly spicy. beef and tendon had star worthy meltinyourmouth texture. noodle was pretty mediocre. it was a good beef noodle soup, but i had better one in southern california e.g. sinbala restaurant & corner beef noodle house . original dry fried chicken # chicken wings deep fried in butter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers pieces of wings for . this is san tung's # signature item. each wing was covered in addicting sweet and sour sauce with slightly spicy kick. chicken quality was pretty good too not too dry and pretty meaty. if you are a fan of kfc not colonel sanders i mean korean fried chicken , then you will appreciate san tung's fried chicken because these wings also had similar sweet & spicy flavor profiles. overall a solid . star on food. p.s. san tung has a sister restaurant right next door san tung , but the sister restaurant does not sell potstickers and dumplings."
330,,Mikayla M.,1117,3.0,6/24/2018,"whenever i pass by this restaurant, there is always a line. i've also heard about their chicken wings that are beyond amazing so finally got to try this place. overall, i enjoyed the food but it did not meet the expectation that i had walking in from what others were mentioning. ordered original dry fried chicken , pork dumplings, and beef fried rice."
331,,Yennhu N.,1117,5.0,5/29/2018,"i first heard of san tung through social media, years ago. everyone would post pictures of their chicken wings and green beans with high praise. but i never really had the desire to try it, because its just asian food. but one day, i happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. and since then, i've been making san tung a regular stop whenever i'm in sf, and introducing it to all my friends. my first time here, i came on a saturday night, during prime time. it was about a minute wait for people. once seated, we ordered the original dry fried chicken , dried sauteed string beans, combination chow mein and potstickers with a bowl of rice. the dry fried chicken was hands down, the best asian fried chicken i've ever had. the wings were cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. each order comes with about wings . the sauce goes great on top of white rice too! the string beans were really good too. it complimented the chicken . the chow mein was a it too oily, but still delicious. the potstickers were massive. i recommend sharing the plate of with people. my top two favorite things were the wings and green beans, definitely a must try. the customer service here was okay. they are very busy so sometimes its hard to get the server's attention. the atmosphere of the restaurant itself resembles any other chinese family restaurant. the parking situation here is very bad though. located in a very popular area, its hard to come across street parking. i had to circle around for minutes before finding something. overall, i highly recommend giving this place a try. its a good place to go with a bigger group of people, that way, you can do family style meal. pro tip there is a san tung right next door, put your name on both and see which one gets called first. from my experience, san tung has a shorter wait time. but there are a few items, like dumplings, that are not served here."
332,,Ly L.,1117,3.0,3/25/2018,"ordered the black bean sauce noodle # , dried sauteed string beans # , pork dumplings # and original dry fried chicken # . the wait for a table was about mins for table of . reasons why i rated a three stars is customer service was not that great and food was not that great. the black bean sauce noodle has shrimp, beef, and calamari over black bean sauce in a noodle. the sauce could be better. was not too impressed by it. kind of plain to me. the pork dumpling would have been better if there was a good special sauce to dip in. i would recommend the dry fried chicken . this is something i would definitely come back for. it is extra hot when it comes out so be careful eating it. the sauce for this chicken is amazing! i would eat it with rice in the future lastly, the dried sauteed string beans. it is pretty typical to get at any chinese restaurant. i still enjoyed it. overall, i give a three stars because i was not impressed with the popular orders. i probably would not come back to eat."
333,,Ling P.,1117,4.0,3/18/2018,"my friend & i visited sf for a minigetaway & san tung made it on our long list of food places to try! we ordered the sauteed string beans, black bean sauce noodles, & of course, the original dry fried chicken wings . the sauteed string beans were crispy and delicious. it was sauteed in this flavorful garlic sauce. definitely a musttry. the black bean sauce noodles was a cross between the chinese and korean version. it was tasty, but it was my least favorite of the that my friend & i ordered. instead of just beef pork, they added shrimp and calamari, which was weird to me. i'm not a fan of seafood in my jajjangmyun zhajiangmian. now, let us get down to the chicken you all. let me tell ya, it was probably one of the best chicken wings i've ever had. it had a savory sweet taste. these wings definitely made it to my overall top favorites that i had to buy a box to bring home to bae. trying to win bgfoty best gf of the year award nom sayin' xd the service was not so great as expected at these type of asian restaurants. it was hard to get water refills and we always had to flag someone down. overall, a great experience in regards to the food, which makes up for the slow service."
334,,Lissette T.,1117,4.0,3/8/2018,"i love this place! for the food.not the wait! original dry fried chicken wings , chow mein, wonton soup, i love everything i've ordered."
335,,Stephanie T.,1117,5.0,1/24/2018,"came here and ordered the original dry fried chicken and black bean sauce noodles and they were both delicious. the original dry fried chicken wings were definitely the highlight of the meal! they were garlicky, gingery, sweet, sour, and had a mild spicy kick. the exterior of the wing was perfectly cooked and the coating was almost like a sticky glaze while the chicken inside was juicy and tender. each bite was full of flavor and i never got tired of it. the dish came with wings so it was a perfect amount to share. the black bean sauce noodles were also good, i'm allergic to shellfish so they were nice enough to separate the shrimp and calamari on the side my friend enjoyed it with her portion . the noodles were chewy, fresh, and the flavor of the black bean sauce was not too overpowering or salty. be prepared for a wait but it is definitely worth it to try!"
336,,Rachel C.,1117,5.0,1/4/2018,"second time here and i cannot not order their original dry fried chicken ! it is hands down the best tasting chicken at a chinese restaurant. possibly in sf, too. as soon as we were seated we already knew we wanted two orders of their chicken and rice! each plate came with pieces so order two plates 'cos you are going to want more. well, especially if you are with a group of hungry friends. the sauce has a little kick to it but is also on the sweeter side. be prepared for sticky fingers, too! but trust, the mess is worth every bite. note it can get really packed so expect a wait. but! there is a san tung right next door to the original spot and there really is not any difference between the two. so avoid the possible wait and just dine inside san tung ! also, if you are craving boba or ice cream afterwards, t pumps is a few blocks down ~ min walk . sf home creamery is also a few blocks up the hill from san tung."
337,,Sally W.,1117,4.0,1/4/2018,"came right when they opened so there was no wait. but the restaurant filled up in mins. we ordered the seaweed soup was decent tasted like instant noodle based soup. string green beans were delicious, nicely cooked and healthy. original fried chicken dry , made me fall in love, it was more sweet than salty pork chow mien was okay, nothing special to it. the fried chicken is what you should come here for! love, canadian tourist"
338,,Mary D.,1117,5.0,12/10/2017,"best fried chicken i've had, hands down! if you are in the san francisco area, you have got to stop by here. my friend and i went here for a weekend trip to visit our other friend, who took us on an adventure full of food and fun lol. originally , this place was on our agenda for lunch on sat, but we had had brunch beforehand and it would have been too much. we ended up coming there for dinner and made sure we were early so we could get their famous original dry fried chicken wings . we found parking luckily before the street got packed, and got in line at pm. the line got really long quickly, and they decided to open early, letting us in at pm. within minutes, it was a full house!! it only took about minutes for our to go order, and the three of us had pieces each. their chicken is one of the best, comparable to korean fried chicken but a little better. they are a little sweet but nonetheless top notch! not sure why the chicken is coined dry fried chicken as it is not dry at all. the outside of the fried chicken was crispy and crunchy, with a mound of sweet thick sauce on the bottom. not sure how the chicken managed to stay crunchy with all the sauce, but it did. it did not matter either because it did not take us long to devour the box. gone in seconds! maybe a little more. the only thing i would do is add more sesame seeds to it. the chicken was so good we ended up coming back for a second order after we had dinner at another restaurant. this time around, we also tried their black bean noodles make sure you ask for black bean noodles and not the wet black bean noodles, as there are items on the menu which were delicious as well. you get a huge order for , and it is mostly noodles drenched in black bean sauce, with small bits of mixed seafood. this place was so good we came back the next day with another friend from out of town! the four of us had more dozen. so dozen original dry fried chicken wings in two days!! i'm not much of a meat eater. so it goes to show how good this place is if we can consume that many chicken wings in a short time lol. i will definitely drop by here the next time i am in the area. quick service and tasty food! happy eating!"
339,,Kimberly L.,1117,5.0,12/8/2017,"i went here with my friends over the weekend when i was in the sf. we got there before pm and there was a line formed in front of the restaurant. they let everyone in even before pm hit. we ordered the original dry fried chicken for the first time first round lol. it was very good and flavorful. the fried chicken was crispy hot and juicy smothered in some sweet and spicy delicious sauce. we saw other trying their black bean noodle. after a couple hours, we came back and we waited for an half hour or so due to the crowded. we got seated with a group of guys since there was limited tables here. we wanted to try to other dishes there so we ordered the black bean noodle. we waited for an half hour or so due to the crowded and we got seated with a group of guys since there was limited tables here. the noodle was smothered with black bean sauces, meats, and seafood. it was quite tasty and good. our servers and services was very fast and attentive every time we were here. so we end up here times over the weekend since one of my friend did not get to go the other day lol. we ordered to dozens of fried chicken wings and that how you know this place is good lol. this place maybe be hard to find parking since it all street parking best to find parking near by residents or elsewhere and walk over. i definitely be back in the future to get more fried chicken from here."
340,,George S.,1117,5.0,10/17/2018,"who knew fried chicken wings were such a delicacy found san tung on yelp and was amazed at the number of reviews. this seemed like an anomaly. since there were so many reviews we decided to come early and beat the dinner rush. so we thought! we pulled up and the sidewalk was already crowded with people waiting. what does that tell you we put our names on the list and it was about an hour wait. if you have the time, it is well worth the wait. once we were seated, we noticed that almost every table in the restaurant had orders of the chicken wings, and some tables have multiple plates of them. besides ordering the chicken wings, we also had pork dumplings , black bean sauce noodles and mongolian beef. everything we ordered was delicious but the dry chicken wings were handsdown our favorite. next time i would get a few orders of them. also multiple tables had orders of the green beans, so will have to try those as well as they were a popular menu item. too bad we do not live closer to san tung. next time we are in san francisco this is a must stop destination for us."
341,,Juan R.,1117,5.0,9/24/2018,"was told this place had great chicken wings, man they were awesome. we arrived at pm , no lines so went for a quick walk. returned at to find a long line. we ordered the fried rice, pork dumplings and an order of regular chicken wings. highly recommend!"

343,,Emily C.,1117,5.0,9/23/2018," stars for the food the pork dumplings are steamy and comforting and taste great with vingear, the dry fried chicken wings are their most popular dish and a mustorder. i personally enjoy eating the wings with their black bean noodles, and i know a lot of other people enjoy their green beans even though they are on the sweeter side for me. overall a place i love to come to for comfort food, even though the wait is usually very long."
344,,Rose N.,1117,4.0,7/26/2018,"i finally tried this place after hearing so much about it for the past few years! my friends and i drove one hour from sj to sf just for their food. it is a typical chinese establishment and the store itself is pretty small. we got there around pm they reopen for dinner at and there was already a huge wait! we put our names party of down and were seated after an hour. i noticed that they have a san tung right next door and was told they open it up when the main store gets too crowded. even though it was really busy when i went, the second store was still closed. it would have been really nice if they opened it to help out with the crowd though. we ordered the string beans, pork dumplings , black bean noodles, and san tung's infamous chicken wings. even though we waited a long time to get seated, the food came out really quickly! the other dishes were pretty standard, nothing too special but the chicken was amazing. the chicken is so flavorful and crispythe hype is real! i would definitely be back just for their chicken!"
345,,Amberly H.,1117,4.0,6/25/2018,"came here after a long mile hike with my friends and boy did it hit the spot! we got here about minutes before they opened and there was already a line forming. if that does not tell you how good the food is i do not know what does. i've come here before for lunch as well and waited around minutes. minutes, minutes, whatever the wait may be, this place is worth it! we ordered plates of the fried chicken, one plate of pork dumplings , the string beans, and the black bean noodles. everyone comes here for the fried chicken, and for good reason! i am completely in love with the sweet salty, sticky sauce that the wings come drenched in. the wings are perfectly crispy and not soggy from the sauce at all! green beans were good. you can either drench them in the sauce they come in or dip them in the chicken wing sauce. otherwise, there is not too much flavor to them. dumplings were as good as dumplings can be. the noodles were probably my least favorite dish to the meal just because i felt that it lacked flavor and some salt. i was hoping it would satisfy my craving for zha jiang mian, but sadly it did not. since we were one of the first tables to order, our food came out really fast i would say within minutes. even when i came during a busier time before, the food would never take long to come out. i really enjoyed this because, on both occasions, i was starving so was glad to receive my food quickly. they do give you a fortune cookie at the end. however, it does not come in a plastic bag like most do, which makes me kind of skeptical about how clean it is. i do not know whether or not they used tongs or something to pick them up, or if they just used their hands to put it on the check holder. i wish they would have bought packaged cookies to serve to their guests just due to sanitation reasons. i will definitely be coming back to this place for the fried chicken time and time again. might try some different noodles though. will keep you updated!"

347,,Stacy A.,1117,4.0,6/18/2018,"yelp challenge must try place in sf! the wet & dry wings are both really delicious!!! they are filled with flavor and they are pretty filling too. we got the pork dumplings and i fell. in. love. soooo good, better than din tai fung!! cons usually a wait and super packed so come early! they also charged us for rice when we did not order or get any. but i confronted them about it and they took it off right away."
348,,Marissa P.,1117,5.0,6/3/2018,"wow, now i know why there is always a line for this place! i know i'm late to the hype, but i could never get here early enough to avoid the ridiculous wait or find parking. so, i was excited when my cousins decided to meet here early for lunch. we planned to get to the restaurant before they opened at am and we did it! that is pretty surprising since we all run on filipino time and we were coming from different areas ssf, san leandro and salinas monterey. parking was hell, but we were lucky enough to find parking in the nearby neighborhood. there was already a long line at am but we were able to get seated as soon as the doors opened. we ordered the popular dry chicken wings yaaaaasss, believe the hype! my friend had let me try her leftovers before and it was so good but having it fresh was just amazing! the crispy chicken tossed in garlic, ginger and chili flakes was worth every bite! garlic flavored eggplant dry fried beef pork dumplings dry sauteed stringbeans house fried rice all was delicious, but the star of the meal was the dry chicken wings! our bill was about for people and we had enough food plus some leftovers. you cannot beat that! there were no issues with the service and not a long wait for the food. will i be back heck yeah! already planning on it!"
349,,Norman S.,1117,2.0,6/2/2018,"sure, the wings are great. thousands of reviews have told you that. but everything else is pretty forgettable. the zhajiang noodles seem just ok. i'm sure you can find better options within a few blocks. the pork dumplings are bland. soy sauce, vinegar and ginger cannot save them. the string beans are fine. but let us be honest, it is hard to screw up string beans. there is nothing much else to say since everything except the chicken wings were not memorable. if you want their wings, just get takeout and save yourself from the awful, hourlong wait and mediocre service."
350,,Ryan F.,1117,3.0,5/30/2018,"i have a huge love hate relationship with san tungs. the food is definitely good and even has the traditional chinese vibe with a diverse crowd of locals and travelers eating here. unfortunately, that usually results in a long line that takes a while to get seated and often after being seated another minutes before a server noticed you. i should note though, san tungs is a fairly well oiled machine given how few staff they had on the floor. i would not last more than an hour doing the work they do where they rotate around between service, cleaning and hosting. i have a lot of respect for the work they do so this review takes that effort into account. as mentioned earlier, service is a little slow so it took roughly minutes after being seated to finally be able to order. once ordered, the food flowed out from the kitchen quite quickly. however, my group ordered a set of steamed potstickers and fried potstickers togo after deciding we were still hungry. our server told us the wait would be minutes but we agreed. once the potstickers arrived, it made the wait just a blip in our memory. despite not being highly sought after on yelp, i highly recommend the steamed potstickers. they had this slightly chewier texture in comparison to the dumplings we ordered. the skin of the dough was more elastic than the dumplings and held the heat of the filling better. truthfully, it was kind of bit similar to the pork dumplings as the filling was the same but the texture of the elastic potsticker skin really made the juicy filling shine better. besides the potstickers, their well known dry chicken was good as usual. it felt as the wings were a bit smaller this time around but all of that was forgotten upon the first bite. one thing that san tungs does so much better than other places for fried chicken is how they seal the moisture of the chicken within the wings while still having a crunchy skin exterior. after finally eating our fill, we asked for the check and paid. as i've said earlier in my review, this place was understaffed for the sheer volume of customers. well for my group, the server forgot our take out order despite ordering it alongside steamed potstickers. since it was already paid for, we looked like idiots waiting at the table after finishing eating. i would hope they can add more staff in the future so they are not overworked but it was not a great experience for a meal to be pulled back another minutes since they forgot to make the fried potstickers. ultimately, this place has great food but their service can improve mostly from having more staff on the floor. my review is mostly a reflection of the food and seeing how hard their staff was working but other patrons were visibly upset at missing orders and long periods between service. tl dr food was great as always but service was mediocre at best. i would also recommend a hidden gem, steamed potstickers over their dumplings ."
351,,P. A.,1117,5.0,5/28/2018,"there is something incredibly charming about a semi dumpy chinese restaurant in a nondescript part of town that draws a line before it even opens. got here minutes before the doors opened am on a holiday , and it filled up within five minutes of opening. there was a good ratio of tourists to locals. we got the chicken wings, pork dumplings , and green beans and enjoyed all three. the green beans were sweeter than other places. chicken wings were crispy, sweet, and not spicy although there is chili paste if you want to add a kick . other tables had noodles and bok choy. if you are in the area, the th st tiled steps are about min away uphill from the restaurant and worth checking out. especially the lower portion has a great succulent garden. take an extra flight of stairs to a great overlook of the city."
352,,Amador A.,1117,5.0,5/22/2018,"wow! on a saturday night at pm the wait was hours long. you know what.it was well worth it. first you have to write you name on the easier board and wait to be called. the guy that calls names, whispers names out to listen carefully. we did not sit with others and other reviewers mentioned. eats combo fried rice, simply delicious. chicken wings, also delicious. the menu stated the wings were spicy. however far from spicy and a more sweet. a def must! pork dumplings were also very good. living in ny give me many options for chinese food so i was hesitance trying chinese food anywhere else. i'm glad my friend recommended this restaurant to me. if i am ever in san francisco again i will be visiting san tung."
353,,Alice H.,1117,4.0,4/29/2018,"went there for their dry fried chicken wings. also ordered pork dumplings , beef with black mushrooms, and chicken fried rice. as usual food was good and service was quick. there was a line even before they opened at ."
354,,Ly L.,1117,3.0,3/25/2018,"ordered the black bean sauce noodle # , dried sauteed string beans # , pork dumplings # and original dry fried chicken # . the wait for a table was about mins for table of . reasons why i rated a three stars is customer service was not that great and food was not that great. the black bean sauce noodle has shrimp, beef, and calamari over black bean sauce in a noodle. the sauce could be better. was not too impressed by it. kind of plain to me. the pork dumpling would have been better if there was a good special sauce to dip in. i would recommend the dry fried chicken. this is something i would definitely come back for. it is extra hot when it comes out so be careful eating it. the sauce for this chicken is amazing! i would eat it with rice in the future lastly, the dried sauteed string beans. it is pretty typical to get at any chinese restaurant. i still enjoyed it. overall, i give a three stars because i was not impressed with the popular orders. i probably would not come back to eat."
355,,Selina H.,1117,5.0,3/20/2018,"wow this place definitely lives up to the hype!! came from la to try their dry fried chicken wings and i was not disappointed. we ordered the chicken wings, black bean noodles, sauteed dry string beans, potstickers, and steamed pork dumplings . the dishes that stood out to me the most were the chicken wings and the string beans. the sauce for the wings is super unique and it is so addicting. i also wish they had black vinegar, but they only had white vinegar so i did not really like the sauce i made for my dumplings . the line can be pretty long, but it actually goes by pretty fast so do not be intimidated. it is worth the wait! i really wish they had a location in la "
356,,Amanda C.,1117,4.0,3/5/2018,"surprised i never reviewed this spot, but i love coming here for their chicken wings! the sauce is so amazing, so make sure you order the string beans too because it is made with the same sauce. they may not have the best service here, but the wings are worth it! i also typically order their pork dumplings and the black bean noodles. even ordering the wings togo is worth it. they opened a second store next door since the lines for this was always crazy, however the first one always tastes better!"
357,,Connie W.,1117,3.0,2/4/2018,"why do i not agree with the popular vote i do not understand why their dry fried chicken is so popular. first of all, wings are not dry, but instead drenched with a sugar glaze. the sauce is so sweet it tasted like the americanized chinese dish called orange chicken. however, the crispy skin is the redeeming feature making it good enough. also ordered the black bean noodles, pork dumplings , seafood soup, and sauteed green bean. all these were upto par."
358,,Kevin N.,1117,3.0,1/20/2018,"i do not get it, maybe i'm blessed by living in southern california specifically the but i do not get the lines and the hype for san tung. do not me. lined up at pm before they opened with people in front of us already. minutes pass and rolls around and line grows by . doors open, everyone floods in, and they surprisingly have space to seat almost everyone that waited with us before . order for chicken wings pieces . x decent, spicy or no spicy, good sauce, very sticky, good but nothing mind blowing that justifies the insane lines. pork dumplings x decent nothing special vegetable dumplings x decent nothing special sauteed string beans . x standard overall sure go try it, make sure to get there before they open or suffer and wait in line. try their chicken wings because they are highly rated and then write a review and me if i'm wrong. standard meal, standard sf pricing, long waits."
359,,Guest U.,1117,4.0,1/2/2018,"been here on and off for years. even before yelp be came famous. as usual the line at pm was out the door. the service was as good as it can with a packed house. we ordered the dried fried chicken, green beans, and pork dumplings . all was good and flavorful. i personally liked the dumplings , but the rest of the group said the fried chicken was the best. i think it is a win win no matter what you order. that is if you get a seat. our party waited more than mins for a seat."
360,,Sherry Y.,1117,3.0,10/17/2018,"chicken wings were alright. definitely suggest to order it with the sauce but if you order it dry, you can ask for the sauce on the side. the chicken wings were nicely fried. if you plan on taking togo or in case of leftovers, order the sauce on the side. i would only order the chicken wings as the few noodle and dumplings potstickers were meh."
361,,S K.,1117,5.0,9/27/2018,"this is my absolute favorite chinese restaurant in the city and i'm born n raised. i love the dried fried garlic chicken wings potstickers noodles garlic green beans so yum! food is fresh and lines can be quite long but most def worth the wait! my whole family loves this place, and those who have not tried should go !!!!"
362,,Julia S.,1117,5.0,9/14/2018,"after reading the reviews, i was expecting a very long wait for lunch. however, when i got there around pm on a friday, i only had to wait a couple minutes before i was seated! the whole restaurant was packed, but the workers were very efficient in cleaning tables and seating the next people on the waitlist. my table got the original dry fried chicken wings, black bean sauce noodles, and potstickers . we came in very hungry, but only ended up finishing the chicken wings and a few potstickers . i personally did not think the noodles and potstickers were anything special, but the fried chicken is something else. i had heard great things about it, and it did not disappoint! i loved the flavor of the sightly spicy coating, and the crunchiness of the skin with the tenderness inside. i would definitely come by again to order more of those!"
363,,Victor S.,1117,1.0,8/28/2018,"i love all the food wings, pot stickers, noods , but service is bad which they get away with because of the popularity. we get there with three parties ahead of us on the board. the host seats three other parties who come in after us.i then have to just ask for a table because the whiteboard system does not really work. that was min which is not horrible.we wait for min for a server. tables that came in after us already have food on the table. put in orders of wings and order of pot stickers. min later we get order of wings. min later a waiter comes over and drops off the check. i ask where the rest of the food is and he tells me what i ordered and then i have to point out we did not get pot stickers either. at this point all the tables have turned over with new guests. we get the rest of the initial order in the next min and they said they meant to bring it at different times. hours to have delicious wings and awesome potstickers ."
364,,Laura S.,1117,5.0,8/22/2018,"i think this place is absolutely worth the hype. all of my friends have been telling me to try it out and i'm so glad that i took my parents there when they are visiting. the open at pm for dinner and there is a line starting around . some people who came before still had to wait so get there early or expect to wait longer. the place quickly fills up and is not the best place for a romantic date, but if you are looking for good food, definitely hit it. we got the famous fried chicken wings must have, so good, the honey walnut prawns fried perfectly, so crisp and yummy with the right amount of mayo and fantastic walnuts. we also ordered their black bean noodles and eggplant. i'm not a big fan of the other two dishes, but just their chicken wings and honey walnut prawn will keep me coming back. i've noticed some people it is chinese food. just want to clarify that it is not authentic food. we do not eat dry fried chicken wings or prawns with mayo lol . but it is sooooo delicious! i have not tried san tung but heard they share the same chef except that they do not have dumplings or potstickers . will definitely try the other one out and come back with an update."
365,,Emily Y.,1117,5.0,7/13/2018,"you are missing out if you have not try this place! this is a must eat place and highly recommend it! parking here may be a hassle, have to circle around multiple times to pray for parking god. finally found and parked at residential area and walk to the restaurant. the wait time could be long during peak hours, there is a paper hanging at the wall for dinein & takeout waitlist, just write your name on there with a party number next to it. once it is done, just hangout and wait outside. if you do not want to wait, san tung next door is always a lot less people waiting in line and can be seated in a shorter wait time they do not sell potstickers dumplings. i mean there is a reason why people rather wait in a long time for this place than next door which they supposed to serve you equivalent food fishes, ya know . you be the judge and decide where to go and eat! this place is definitely worth my time to wait and we ordered the following amazing dishes, i swear each dish is on crack, very addicting and ridiculously delicious with loads of heavy tasting of sodium for sure, but they are sooo good. . shrimp & leek dumpling im never a big fan of leek, but these dumplings are simply tasty with handmade dumpling doughy wrap with fully stuffed of meats, leek and shrimp inside. i was not expecting much outta this, but it turned out to be pretty good. dumplings were kinda small but it was more like a one bite size for me and served as good appetizer. we got too hungry and devoured these dumplings in no time right after they served to ya after the long wait time approx. mins hr . jjajiangmyun . black bean sauce was well made and once mixed well with freshly cooked noodles, it was ready to eat. i did not like much of the big pieces of onions which was overpowering the overall taste , but loved the thinly slice of cucumber in there. since this place mostly served we ordered mostly heavy taste foods, so comparing to other dishes, this one became kinda bland and i had to mix up with more chili spicy sauce in order to taste the food! . dried spicy chicken wings they put crack on there i swear lol , each piece of fried chicken wing was wellmarinated and well mixed up with spicy, sweet and saltiness. loved the crispy outside and mighty batters and served super hot and came right out to your table, it was super addictive and i could not stop eating them. my friend said even leftover reheated up was still very surprisingly deliciousness. can totally see why every table orders this infamous dried spicy chicken wings, could not agree more this is the best chicken wings i've ever had! . stir fried green beans this was a must order if you want some greens lol . it was salty sweet and oily dish, but better to eat some greens than nothing, right!!! lots of sodium & sugar & spicy sauce make every dish tasted so freaking delicious. i could so tell because the next day i woke up, my face and body was feeling super bloated, and my double eyelids even got disappeared and became single eyelid lolllllll . imagine the amount of sodium, msg and other stuffs they put in the foods, do not get me wrong! i love their foods, and it was definitely worth my trip to visit and dine in here. i will be back for sure yummmmm ^^"
366,,Jason M.,1117,4.0,6/28/2018,"tip skip the line and order takeout. you are a block away from the park and the botanical gardens are nearby. i really really wanted the wet fried chicken wing sauce to be outstanding. it was great and i really enjoyed the wings. these are not wimpy, scrimpbytheirreputation sized wings. this is a full batch. so, size wise a grown man will be satisfied with one order of wings. but, the sauce was not as sweet or spicy as i wanted. the sauce fell somewhere in the middle which left me wanting more. the potstickers were great. i loved that the stickers were thick and breaded. the meat mixture had a nice flavor. here again, i really wanted the excess sauce from the fried chicken to be available to dip the stickers. i did that but it just was not all that i hoped for. i will return and try the dry fried chicken wings."
367,,Luke L.,1117,4.0,6/25/2018,"you know why you are here yup you are here for those legendary chicken wings. the name san tung translates to the word shan dong a province in china and the province is best known for its dumplings. since the province is just one yellow sea away from korea, san tung's menu also have several korean influenced dishes. our group got here minutes before the opening time and the restaurant opened minutes early pm . initially the restaurant was % filled up, but by the time we walked out at pm the restaurant was completely packed. food did take a while to come out + minutes , but service was actually pretty good comparing with other chinese restaurants english friendly menu & waiters spoke good english . five spice beef noodle # sliced five spice beef and tendon in a bowl of fresh homemade soup noodles accompanied with spinach, this was the first beef noodle soup i had with broth that contains pieces of ginger, but broth had an interesting aroma and tasted slightly spicy. beef and tendon had star worthy meltinyourmouth texture. noodle was pretty mediocre. it was a good beef noodle soup, but i had better one in southern california e.g. sinbala restaurant & corner beef noodle house . original dry fried chicken # chicken wings deep fried in butter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers pieces of wings for . this is san tung's # signature item. each wing was covered in addicting sweet and sour sauce with slightly spicy kick. chicken quality was pretty good too not too dry and pretty meaty. if you are a fan of kfc not colonel sanders i mean korean fried chicken , then you will appreciate san tung's fried chicken because these wings also had similar sweet & spicy flavor profiles. overall a solid . star on food. p.s. san tung has a sister restaurant right next door san tung , but the sister restaurant does not sell potstickers and dumplings."
368,,Victor V.,1117,5.0,6/6/2018,"amazing food and probably the best potstickers i've ever tried. for the price it is totally worth it, definitely coming back here again!"
369,,Chul L.,1117,4.0,6/2/2018,"came here on a saturday for lunch. there was a long waiting list, but we were lucky enough to just wait for about mins. my friend took us here as he recommended this restaurant. the food is amazing!!! i highly recommend their potstickers . its super juicy and has so much flavor. totally different from the usual potstickers you get from the supermarket. at first we were debating if we should go to the same # restaurant next door but we decided to wait a little longer and try their main restaurant. it was really worth the wait!! san tung no next door do not offer potstickers . did not know how good the potstickers were until i tried it. definitely worth the wait. just for the potstickers . parking can be a bit hectic, as they do not have a private lot and you have to find limited parking on the street. we were lucky enough to find a parking spot right next to the restaurant, but it get can tough. fyi, their fried chicken is really good as well."
370,,Yennhu N.,1117,5.0,5/29/2018,"i first heard of san tung through social media, years ago. everyone would post pictures of their chicken wings and green beans with high praise. but i never really had the desire to try it, because its just asian food. but one day, i happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. and since then, i've been making san tung a regular stop whenever i'm in sf, and introducing it to all my friends. my first time here, i came on a saturday night, during prime time. it was about a minute wait for people. once seated, we ordered the original dry fried chicken, dried sauteed string beans, combination chow mein and potstickers with a bowl of rice. the dry fried chicken was hands down, the best asian fried chicken i've ever had. the wings were cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. each order comes with about wings. the sauce goes great on top of white rice too! the string beans were really good too. it complimented the chicken. the chow mein was a it too oily, but still delicious. the potstickers were massive. i recommend sharing the plate of with people. my top two favorite things were the wings and green beans, definitely a must try. the customer service here was okay. they are very busy so sometimes its hard to get the server's attention. the atmosphere of the restaurant itself resembles any other chinese family restaurant. the parking situation here is very bad though. located in a very popular area, its hard to come across street parking. i had to circle around for minutes before finding something. overall, i highly recommend giving this place a try. its a good place to go with a bigger group of people, that way, you can do family style meal. pro tip there is a san tung right next door, put your name on both and see which one gets called first. from my experience, san tung has a shorter wait time. but there are a few items, like dumplings, that are not served here."
371,,Ashley M.,1117,5.0,5/7/2018,"incredible staff. yes there is going to be a wait because it is worth it. ordered the famous dry fried wings, potstickers a must, dry black bean noodles, and rice. everything was superb. cannot wait to go back. make sure you stay close to the board where you add your name. some guest changed our party number from to probably to get a table sooner."
372,,Big F.,1117,5.0,5/7/2018,"came here for the first time on a saturday after a short hike. since the original san tung was super busy, we decided to go next door to san tung # . # does not offer potstickers or dumplings according to the sign. we ordered the fried chicken wings with drumsticks and the jalapeno black bean noodle since every table seems to have a bowl of noodles. the chicken wings were amazing, so crispy, crunchy, flavorful with ginger, garlic, soy sauce taste. i have had smoother texture of the chicken wing flesh but these wings definitely win first place for flavor! i was also surprised with the noodle, they really infused the jalapeno into the black bean sauce. compared with the korean version, this one is less oily and more texture to the sauce. i would definitely definitively want to come back."

376,,Christina N.,1117,4.0,1/28/2018,"came here on a tuesday evening for dinner and there was a short wait. we ordered some of the yelp recommended dishes and they were all pretty good. fried chicken yep, must order! the sauce is sweet and tangy. chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy tender inside. yum! sizzling rice soup peppery soup perfect for a cool night. will order again! dried sauteed green bean this was sweet, which was a little odd for me since i'm used to a more garlicky version of this dish. it was good, but probably not for me. potstickers this was okay. the dumplings were fairly large in size but the filling was generous and the skin was thin. the restaurant feels more like they were serving american chinese food with how sweet the dishes were. i would not make a trip here specially for it, but it is a solid choice if you are around the area!"
377,,Valerie D.,1117,4.0,1/20/2018,"i'm probably going to receive a lot of flack for this but this place is overhyped. there, i said it. the potstickers were good. the dumplings were good. the wings were bomb. would i line up at am or am to eat here though nooope! the wings are crunchy and the sauce is the perfect concoction of sweet, bbqlike, and sticky but i cannot fathom the idea of lining up for these wings. do not get me wrong though the food is good but i was not blown away. we arrived about minutes before san tung opened for dinner and were one of the only few people in line. however, this place quickly got filled minutes into dinner service. parking was a breeze too so i would recommend coming early! verdict skip the early morning line and come for dinner."
378,,Yien S.,1117,4.0,1/3/2018,"tried this place for the first time with a large party. loved how crispy their dry fry chicken was but, the sauce was a little too sweet for me and the drumettes were kind of on the small side. some of the potstickers we got had holes on the bottom, i guess it really stuck to the pot lol . the other dishes we ordered were fine, nothing special green beans, chow mein, fried rice, eggplant and dry fry shrimp heavy on white pepper. service was just ok for a typical asian restaurant , water was not refilled, they forgot a couple of dishes but was prompt when notified and when i asked for some hot water, server gave it to me in a glass, not a mug so it was kind of difficult to pick up. i would return just for the chicken wings but will ask for light sauce."

384,,Cecilia Y.,1117,5.0,8/26/2018,"i've wanted to visit this place for over five years but have not had the chance to till this past saturday. we came around pm and there was a huge list of people in front of us. thankfully since we were a party of , we took up the bigger table which allowed us to be like the next party. we ordered like plates of the dry fried chicken, order of the wet fried chicken, dry black bean sauce noodles , string beans , rice, and mongolian beef. we ordered the extra plate of fried chicken and the noodles after realizing we were still hungry and that the dishes were that good. the chicken was saucy but still was crispy which i really appreciated. the chicken was not soggy or anything which i loved. it had a kick of spice and a kick of sweetness to it. sooooooo gooood. the wet chicken was not that different from the dry chicken but just slightly sour. it was still very good but my friends and i preferred the dry chicken. the other dishes were honestly so delicious and fresh. had tons of flavor. very affordable chinese food. i am constantly thinking about the fried chicken from here despite only having it once in my life. we devoured all of the dishes bc this place was just that good. i cannot wait to come back here. a must visit when coming to sf."
385,,Derek T.,1117,4.0,7/8/2018,"san tung is very popular though i guess you already know that coming here. everyone says to come here for the dry fried chicken, so that is what i came for. now mind you the wait can be incredibly long for dinner and weekends. if you are lucky enough to come on a weekday during lunch then the wait will be closer to minutes as opposed to + minutes. so, expect no service because cantonese restaurants are business only where you order food, eat food, pay, and leave. you are not there for a pleasant conversation with the waiters. so the dry fried chicken had a great crunch to it and the sauce was caked if not caramelized onto the chicken. the dry black bean sauce noodles are good and the meat and veggies are not cut so finely where they all get lost and congregate at the bottom of the bowl. all in all, san tung is good quality food but i would not wait longer than minutes to wait for a table though. so if you want to eat here, come before the lunch or dinner rush or go on a weekday for lunch."
386,,Maria P.,1117,4.0,6/21/2018,"when i lived in san francisco this restaurant was located a few blocks away from my home. as you walk in looks like a hole in the wall, located believes someone's house. spacious dining room, clean not spanking clean clean where it is not questionable. how i test cleanliness is if you can take a peek into the kitchen and also see how clean the up keep of the bathroom is. that will give you insight. when we arrived it was late afternoon around pm, not many people which was great because the wait here is exceptionally long. imagine capacity of this restaurant holds and its usually packed. we sat down and got service right away. there was a table nearby where many of the staff were sitting on a round table and the table was filled seriously a mound of fresh green beans . there was about staff members cleaning the green beans . it was fun to watch as they works methodically and quickly. very efficient! as we got our drinks and the menu. menu is several pages which looked like hundreds of selection. when i see a menu that is more than pages i get overwhelmed. what is nice about their menu is it is all very organized under category. we ordered everything that they are known for, chicken wings and the dry black bean sauce noodles with shrimp is amazing and we ordered a few sides of vegetables like black bean eggplant and pan dry sauteed string beans . note the noodles are homemade. the portions are enormous so family style here is perfect. no one will leave hungry. each dish we ordered was delicious and so good that we ordered side of garlic noodles to take on the flight back home to san diego. i would literally fly from sd to sf to purchase the dry black bean sauce noodles , # on noodles section of menu. mind you the eggplant as delicious and succulent as it was. a little oily, so i take my napkin and absorb the extra oil. yes, that is what i do to remove extra calories. value and piece affordable lots of history this restaurant and carve your time to come here. so many other million restaurants in the city, thou this one is special. enjoy and bon apetite!"

388,,Ronaldinhio T.,1117,2.0,3/12/2018,"everyone who has lived in the inner sunset or around this area has practically grown up with san tung. however over the years they have become quite repetitive and the lack of variety brings nothing interesting to the place, even if you like chinese food you will end up bored here. the ambiance is okay and for the price you can get a large dish with noodles . i usually have their dry black bean noodles or the chicken wings i like the dry ones . when it comes to this restaurant the only thing dependable about this place is that the taste would always be the same the menu too, it never changes . do not expect exceptional service or to be greeted with a smile. i've had better burgers elsewhere but this is the embodiment of a chinese food."
389,,Annie H.,1117,5.0,2/8/2018,"san tung was my favorite meal in san francisco. their popular dry chicken wings were delicious, crispy flavorful. must get item. dry black bean noodles and string beans were also good. i was lucky enough to wait less than mins but my friends has waited over an hour, which i prob would not do for next time."
390,,Tony C.,1117,3.0,1/1/2018,"oh man. this one is tough. long lines. got here at pm and the line was long already. they started seating at pm and we got in. but by doing this, it kills the kitchen. food came out sporadically. chicken wings were the last thing to come out. took over minutes. we already finished everything. dry black bean noodles good noodles . good sauce . lots of msg pork dumplings nothing special. average dumplings mushu pork the pancake tortillas were soggy. not house made. the filling was ok. lots of msg. string beans delicious but super sweeeeeeet. chicken wings you get wings for . . which is a dollar a wing. the size of these wings were small average. nothing wow. the sauce is garlic, sugar, red pepper, ginger. it was good. overall delicious place for chinese food. not authentic but still good none the less."
391,,LeeAnn B.,1117,5.0,12/22/2017,this is my absolute favorite restraint. the dried fried chicken wings are so crispy and the sauce is delicious. the dry black bean sauce noodles are also delicious. i am from san jose but make the trip to san francisco just to visit this restaurant
392,,Alex L.,1117,5.0,11/2/2017,"so many great reviews coming from this place, that i must try! san tung is actually the first restaurant my girlfriend and i had arriving to san francisco. i've never been to san francisco, but everyone has been talking about it. all my friends who have came here mentioned the dry fried chicken wings!! we walked inside and it was already pretty busy by noon. i'm so glad we made it in time before the rush of locals came through. we put our name down and were sat down at a table within ten minutes. pretty happy we did not have to wait because i hear it is sometimes a long wait. anyways! so we ordered the dry fried chicken wings, the dry black ban noodles , and the dumplings. the dry black ban noodles and the dumplings came out first. i'm glad it did because i will tell you right now that it was not as good as i thought it would be. the noodles were plain and the sauce did not have any flavor at all. it was just ok, i do not think i would have it again to be honest. the dumplings had a lot of flavor to it, you did not need to add extra soy sauce to it. however, there was too much leech in it and not enough shrimp. saving the last dish for last! time for the main dish! the dry fried chicken wings. hands down, i only give this restaurant five stars because of this dish. other then that i do not think i would recommend anything else. the chicken was so good, it is not your normal chicken wings. very crispy, tender, and the right amount of spices. golden and the sauce on top of it was bomb! please do yourself a favor and order like a gang of these and have some rice also lol. crazy how one dish taste so much better then the rest. i heard the green beans were good! i will have to come back one day to try those with the chicken."
393,,Laura C.,1117,3.0,10/28/2017,"i first visited san tung many years ago could not remember the experience, and have been wanting to go back. recently had the chance to pay a visit timing was great as we went during the weekend, right as they were opening for dinner. no wait, but after minutes or so, the place was full. it is a small spot, but looks like they also own the building next door to hold additional diners. feels like your standard asian restaurant not really nice or fancy, but not a complete hole in the wall either. of course, we got their special fried chicken, along with some dumplings and noodles . the dumplings were ok, nothing to really write home about. the presentation was a little dull, so there were no oohs and ahhs when it was dropped off on our table. the dry black bean sauce noodles were ok too the portion size seemed smaller than what i had expected and it is supposed to have seafood. i could barely seefood, only a few pieces. this was a bit of a bummer. as for their fried chicken, i did not see it standing out beyond the likes of places like bonchon. sure, it is good, but i'm short of calling it amazingly special. the food did not wow me, and i felt that prices were a few dollars higher on each entree than other chinese places. i think the popularity of this place has allowed them to increase the prices, but i personally did not feel the quality or quantity was worth it. it is not a bad place, but was not great either. service was on par with other chinese restaurants. i'm glad i finally had a chance to come back after so many years, but not sure if i will be back. did feel overhyped."
394,,Jessa May C.,1117,4.0,9/23/2017,"pros the fried chicken is probably the best item on the menu! it was crispy and sweet, and enough to share taste! the non dry ] black bean noodles were also pretty, not too salty nor sweet, and very moist in comparison to chow mein. cons it was really busy and took us a while to get seated. also, the fried chicken took a lot longer to get out in comparison to the black bean noodles . would try again, but maybe just for the fried chicken togo!"
395,,D R.,1117,5.0,9/11/2017,"the best fried chicken ever!! order one togo and it is still crispy when you reheat it the next day. also, the sauteed green beans are very fresh and flavorful. last thing, go for the dry black bean noodles too! parking is a bit difficult and lines could get long but totally worth the wait!"
396,,Hanyu Z.,1117,4.0,8/13/2017,"after hearing many many good reviews about sun tung, we finally gave it a try. came here on a saturday for dinner and the restaurant was packed. waited for about mins to get seated. with k plus reviews on yelp, the waiting time was actually much better than we expected ordered their signature dry fried chicken wings, came with pieces. the chicken wings were legit, crispy and tender, covered by this awesome sweet sauce with some red chili pepper. love it! we also ordered their shrimp dumpling and dry black bean sauce noodle . the shrimp dumplings came with pieces and were surprisingly good! tasted like home made dumplings with rich ingredients. really really good dumplings. dry black bean sauce noodle was just ok. it has zucchini, scallops, shrimps, onions covered by black sauce . it does not taste like the traditional chinese dry black bean sauce noodle anymore, and i was a little disappointed."
397,,Stephanie Ann L.,1117,5.0,7/28/2017,"this is the spot to come to whenever you are in sf however be ready to wait if you come at peak hours. there is a white board you write your name on for the wait list, but be careful if people erase anything. there are little to no space to wait inside so outside is where everyone is at it is kind of a drag when it is cold windy. fortunately most of the time i've come the most i've had to wait was about minutes. there was one time i left because the wait was waaayy too long. there were also a couple times we made the drive out and the were closed when their hours said they would be open! i do recommend calling ahead to see if they are open because it was at random times! but still stars because i will always come back. one time i came with my bf and we sat at a table of and was sitting with another group of and to get seated faster. it was cool we got seated right away and was able to order. we did not mind and the other parties were cool were not distracting or anything. the original dry fried chicken always a must have, paired w the green beans . sooo good, but i would always get rice w the chicken to balance the flavors. you usually get about pieces of the wings which is more than enough when you order additional food which you should to try everything else esp if you waited. i've also had the dumpings, dry black bean sauce noodles , and fried rice. which is all very, very good."
398,,Desmond C.,1117,4.0,6/23/2017,"pretty damn solid food. come here for the dry fried chicken wings!! they are amazing. i came here around pm on a sunday. surprisingly the wait was not too long. in fact, i stepped away with my party for half an hour and they crossed out my name since they called us and we were not there at the time . regardless, after talking with the waiter, we were seated when the next free table opened up y what we ordered dry fried chicken wings . you see every table have a plate of this and it is not hard to see why. the sauce is super tasty and sweet, and you can occasionally taste a very small hint of spicy very small though because there are a few chopped up red chili peppers. in addition, the wings are super crispy coming out. i do not know about you but it is so much more satisfying biting into a crunchy chicken wing than a soggy one. that, the sauce , and the warm tender meat made this dish a must have. hell, i would bring my friends here to binge on the wings. garlic eggplants . very garlicky taste. i love garlic so this is a solid dish. warm and moist eggplant was yummy, and like the wings, had a verry small hint of spicy. black bean sauce noodles . . i actually mistakenly ordered the dry black bean sauce noodles , but the waiter was very good and got us some of the sauce for the non dry noodles . it was decent, but nothing spectacular. not much squid meat in it though, which was slightly disappointing. i would not mind getting it again."
399,,Joe J.,1117,3.0,9/18/2016,terrible service but good dried fried chicken wings and dry black bean noodle . the regular black bean noodle is not that great
400,,Christine H.,1119,5.0,11/1/2018,"this review is for the views and their award winning clam chowder which was voted first place in a fisherman's wharf contest.means a lot since there are numerous clam chowder spots here the views are great here you can see alcatraz, the bridge, etc . the service is pleasant, efficient, and professional. the clam chowder and sourdough bread are delicious! plus, it was only ish for a decentsized bowl of clam chowder .totally worth it considering that this is a pretty highend place with a super nice view . clam chowder details lots of clam , lots of veggies, and a perfectly warm and seasoned chowder .with a toasted and heavenly piece of sourdough bread.enuf.said. note it is probably wise to make a reservation. also, they have this automatic sf surcharge i forgot what it was for ."
401,,Elena N.,1119,3.0,10/1/2018,"so i decided to do a touristy day. since a friend and i were going to be at fisherman's wharf, i suggested doing a seafood dinner at pier . i made a reservation through yelp for a party of two about a week prior for thursday, september th at pm. we showed up a few mins early and had to wait for a little bit. we were seated about mins after our reservation at a table by the window, so we had a nice view. red chili garlic shrimp red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic award winning clam chowder bowl garlic roasted whole dungeness crab served with vegetables and roasted fingerling potatoes and butter ultimate dirty martini tito's vodka, dry vermouth, olive juice and a blue cheese stuffed olive barrel aged manhattan up bulliet bourbon, carpano antica formula sweet vermouth house aged in liter oak barrels duckhorn napa valley, california ' i wanted the crab and clam chowder . since my friend and i always over order, we added the shrimp. the clam chowder was nice and creamy with a good amount of clams . a little thicker than i prefer, but still a good bowl. the crab was a little disappointing. there was not enough garlic flavor. plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. it was just an empty she will for decoration. if a restaurant states a whole crab, i think that should include the head. the shrimp were okay. had a nice heat, but i did not really like the sauce. a little too sweet for me. dinner came with complimentary bread & butter, which was good for soup dipping. service here was nice and friendly. they were busy cuz there was a convention in town, so there were times when we had to flag down our server. the wine was good and paired well with our food. both cocktails were okay. a little light for my tastes, but at least the pricing was not too bad. a nice dinner for a touristy spot, but the food was a little underwhelming. stars."
402,,Lisa E.,1119,5.0,9/21/2018,"came here with a friend for the first time. great service from our server beautiful views even though we sat in the back room. ordered a delicious malbec through the urging of our server yummy. i ordered the award winning clam chowder and indeed they are correct. followed it with the mixed grill, all was cooked to perfection. would come here again in a heartbeat."

404,,Jay R.,1119,5.0,8/19/2018,"this place was amazing. from the fresh bread & butter to our appetizers and main dishes. we chose to have their award winning clam chowder and we understand exactly why it was award winning . steamed clams , caesar salad as appetizers. all dishes were amazing along with a wonderful wine list. we sat next to a clean large window with beautiful views of the bay. customer service was on point and we got seated quickly since we had reservations. we will definitely return for many more trips."
405,,Courtney L.,1119,5.0,8/14/2018,"during my family's trip to san francisco, our mission was to find a restaurant that showcased the bay's fresh seafood at fairly reasonable prices, and fog harbor delivered! located on the second floor of pier , this restaurant has a classy ambiance and a scenic view of the water where you can spot the sea lions in the distance. we were greeted by our waiter who took great care of us throughout dinner. he was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. we started off our seafood feast by sharing the red chili garlic shrimp appetizer . it contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce. although i enjoyed the spicy flavors and tingling heat, i did not find that it was the best value. i also could not help but try a cup of their award winning clam chowder , which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. yum, this is a must! for my entree, i went with a lighter plate, being the seared pacific cod . the fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. it was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. the aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and i loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. with the cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. two of my family members ordered the mixed grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. they enjoyed their entrees as well. this was easily one of the best seafood meals my family had in years. thank you to fog harbor for such a memorable dinner to start off our visit to san francisco on the right foot! . stars."
406,,Mike N.,1119,1.0,8/4/2018,"the restaurant has great ambience while still in the prime location of pier . however today i was deeply disappointed with their service. we had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. we had the award winning clam chowder , dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna. the clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. the crab cakes were good as well. i liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. but the service here, was just terrible. our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. we had to ask for everything, straws, etc . our table was never cleared at anytime either. all of our plates were just sitting on the table. i was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. the oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. the ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. after paying + dollars is this what i should expect by all means i have no issue spending money on food. but it really just hits a nerve when i get crappy service and i'm paying for it. i would go else where if your thinking about the fog harbor fish house."
407,,Cindy G.,1119,3.0,8/1/2018,"waited minutes to hour for dinner as no reservations were available. enjoyed wandering around fisherman's wharf and the time passed rather painlessly. given the review and crowds, i was looking forward to a tasty dinner. i started with their award winning clam chowder . the temperature of my chowder was tepid, otherwise the soup was creamy and full of clams . my dinner choice was the crab roll. i really wanted to try their crab but was lazy and did not want to get messy work dinner . i think a little celery salt and a lot less mayo would have helped. the fries were hot, crispy and nicely salted. the complementary hot sourdough roll was the best thing i ate."
408,,M C.,1119,5.0,7/23/2018,this is a great place to visit on the pier if you are looking for a delicious family dinner or lunch. the view of alcatraz was breathtaking. the steak with whiskey sauce is very good. award winning clam chowder is amazing! service was quick and convenient. by far my favorite place on the pier.
409,,Surf City M.,1119,5.0,7/14/2018,"the crab roll was legit! full of crab, celery and a light sauce on toasted sourdough. i also tried the award winning clam chowder which was really good. my family and i were seated in a nice spot with view of alcatraz and enjoyed some nice cocktails."
410,,Ralph R.,1119,5.0,6/25/2018,"went for lunch while in san francisco. it is a large restaurant on pier on the upper level. the window seats overlook the harbor and the sea lion resting area . we started with the award winning clam chowder and i could certainly see why it won the award . it was delicious. so was the dungeness crab cocktail. of course we had to have the cioppino which was fantastic. the steamed whole dungeness crab was well received. and the crab ceviche was outstanding. not only was the food very good, so was the service."
411,,Vickie Z.,1119,5.0,6/4/2018,"do not let the location of pier scare you off as a tourist trap. having lived in the city for over years, this is one of the best seafood places i've ever had. recommend making reservations so you can ask for a window seat next to the water. oh, and the seals. the meal clam chowder for bowl this is their award winning clam chowder . wowza, i could see why! forget boudin, this is the winner right here. they give you so much variety and freshness of seafood in this bowl of goodness right here. plus, no need for a bread bowl when they serve complimentary sourdough bread for the table. imo, dipping the bread and soaking up all the chowder flavor is much better than having a bread bowl. mmm! jumbo scallop & crab risotto seasonal item. wow again. these were some of the best scallops i've ever had in my life. they were so buttery and juicy and perfectly seared. the risotto was creamy and the crab made it even more flavorful. the dab of pesto was a nice touch. cioppino ok to be fair, by the time this came out, i had stuffed myself silly with sourdough bread and the above two dishes. this was still amazing though. very flavorful and wonderfully decorated with an abundant of seafood. no tough pieces, everything f are e s h. note, they provide you bibs so do not be afraid to get the cioppino the normal way and opt out of the additional services for the readytoeat way . all their menu items come from % sustainable seafood. additionally, service was wonderful. they knew we were sharing all items, and split our entrees into two beautifully plated dishes. everything was divine."
412,,HeeYoung Y.,1119,4.0,6/4/2018,super kind services and great foods and drink! award winning clam chowder was no need to say. i recommend a bread bowl one rather than regular ones. garlic roasted crab was fantastic. it serves for two perfectly.
413,,Andrew P.,1119,5.0,4/23/2018,had a great brunch here yesterday. we ordered a seafood tower and their award winning clam chowder . everything came out quick and was well prepared. service was good and we were seated right away at opening. we had a reservation via open table although we did not need it but it is always good to reserve just in case with popular places like this. the view of the bay overlooks the gg bridge and alcatraz island. i would recommend this place if you like good seafood.
414,,Anthony N.,1119,5.0,4/19/2018,"have you ever wish you could enjoy a delightful meal with a breathtaking view of the ocean. there is just something soothing about listening to the waves crashing upon the shore. for many, it can be very therapeutic and a comforting experience to indulge in. add a glass of wine and your significant other to the picture and you will never want to leave that moment of euphoria. so if you are ever around, fog harbor would be the perfect getaway for this kind of occasion. f.h.f.h was not apart of my friend's and i agenda. we had initially stop by to check out the pier but ended up giving this place a try. we had walked in during one of their slow nights of a while back ago and got immediately seated at the bar. we had a couple of luggages on us so we did not opt for any tables. the bartender who was working behind the bar was also our server as well. he initially greeted himself and took our beverage orders. as my friend and i were glancing through their array of seafood selections, we both wanted to get two appetizer to share. we were not as hungry but we were willing to see what this place has to offer. we ended up ordering the mussels and their award winning clam chowder bowl. they provided complimentary bread to us which was great to dip with the mussels. several minutes later, our meals had came out and we both started digging in. the mussels were perfectly cooked and marinated in the white wine broth. there was a subtle taste coming from the roasted garlic and a sweet tang from the tomatoes. a beautifully well executed dish i must say. as for the clam chowder bowl, the sourdough bread felt as it was freshly baked from the oven. the exterior of the bread was still nice and crunchy and the inside was soft like marshmallows. the clam chowder had chunks of potatoes, bits of chopped clam and also had a rich tasting cream broth. the juices from clams and cream were in perfect harmony which provided that sweet and savory component to the dish. i very much enjoyed since i am a huge sourdough fanatic. i highly recommend this to others! my overall experience was a superb one. their customer service was right on the dime and the quality of seafood was worth every penny. the panoramic window scenery was definitely a experience to remember."
415,,Jasmine P.,1119,5.0,2/11/2018,"the fog harbor fish house was a magnificent venue to celebrate my birthday. our seating could not have been more perfect with a view of the sf bay and to sausalito, the food was flavorful & all deliciousness and the staff was pleasant, attentive & friendly. i was craving for a whole crab along with a side of pasta & veggies. their award winning clam chowder also lives up to its reputation. i left there very satisfied. we will be back soon on our next visit. thank you for a splendid dining experience. it was a beautiful afternoon evening to be in sf."
416,,Hai L.,1119,5.0,1/14/2018,"it is hard deciding on a place to eat when you are at pier . there are so many opportunities and places to check out. after a lot of searching, decided to check out this place based on a large amount of positive reviews. this is an institution that serves fresh seafood and gives off a scenic view of the pier. the dining experience and views of the bay area and golden gate bridge attracts visitors and tourists to visit this restaurant at least once. there appeared to be a half hour wait due to how busy it was. not a problem. the wait seemed to go by immediately and suddenly we were already inside the restaurant. fog harbor is said to serve % sustainable seafood which could be a bias to anyone who has not tried it. the menu offers a great selection of food. customers get to enjoy complimentary sourdough bread that is baked in house. to start off with the appetizer, we decided to go with a dozen baked oysters that consists of spinach, bacon, and creamy parmesan sauce. these oysters were incredible. it felt like they popped right in your mouth and had so much flavor. i decided to also get the award winning clam chowder bread bowl! this was amazing as well. for the entree, i decided to go with the mixed grill platter that is made with grilled salmon, pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, sauteed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. food was prepared instantly and did not take long to bring out. the waiter was really friendly but did not bring out water drinks immediately to begin with. had to give him a reminder. no problem. for a beverage, i also went with the oz flint and steel sauvignon that was recommended by the waiter. this wine pairs well with fish and had a stronger taste. i would give this restaurant stars based on the food. price is a bit on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. amazing views depending on where you are seated along with fresh seafood right near the pier. definitely would go again!"
417,,Joanne S.,1119,4.0,1/14/2018,"every time my mom comes to sf i take her to get seafood at fog harbor fish house. great view of the bay and alcatraz, located at pier so lots of touristy things to do within walking distance. of course, with the tourist location comes tourist prices but it is not that bad. in terms of food, their award winning clam chowder is quite good particularly with the added crab . we usually come for the lobster very fresh and dungeness crab the garlic is seriously good! this is their best dish! we have had some other dishes here and there that were reliably good but nothing that springs to mind years later. service is usually quite good and you can get seated usually within an hour even if there is a wait no problem there is lots to do while you wait! this time around we got the clam chowder again as well as the seared pacific cod and the mussel fries. the mussel fries were fabulous being a seafood house you might not expect their fries to be top notch but they are, and the cream sauce was delicious. the pacific cod, which was the dish recommended by our waiter, was honestly our least favorite dish that we have tried here. i generally prefer for my cod to have that juicy, oily mouthfeel and the cod was a little dry, maybe due to the thickness of the fish do not know if you can tell from the picture but it was about inch thick when it arrived on the table . however our waiter was fabulous at everything else, including getting our check to us early as we had lost track of time and had an upcoming appointment. my brother usually comes with us and always gets the burger because he does not like seafood. it is alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger it does comes with those delicious fries. tl dr great views, great service, great area, generally great food. get the clam chowder , lobster, mussel fries, and % get the dungeness crab. do not expect too much from the nonseafood options. expect tourist prices given it is a tourist location to me it is worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway. we will be coming back!"
418,,Jennie N.,1119,5.0,12/30/2017,"i usually void fisherman's wharf especially around the holidaysgetting run over by strollers and pedestrians just are not my thang but i was in a rather cheery mood and decided to take in the christmas decorations before they get torn down. we decided to have dinner at fog harbor fish house thanks to yelp reviews and they did not disappoint. for starters, we had the calamari, red chili garlic shrimp and mussel fries. all were quite tasty, particularly the garlic shrimp. that sauce had the right amount of spice and kick. we followed with their award winning clam chowder in a bread bowlthick and creamy with plenty of clam chunks. just yums! for the main course, we ordered the cioppino, ahi tuna and seafood penne. my little tot had the chicken tenders. all are highly recommended including the tendersvery meaty and well.tender. everything was great but what really brought this review from a star experience to is our waiter, justin. he was accommodating and made sure our dinner experience was an unforgettable one. we were all pleasantly surprised by justin's attentiveness, how fresh the food was and our overall experience considering the restaurant is in a tourist trap. if you are in the area and do not mind the wait and the crowds, fog harbor is worth the visit."
419,,Miriam T.,1119,5.0,12/30/2017,"came in for the award winning clam chowder . i had it topped with crab and caesar salad. the soup was creamy delicious. the iceberg lettuce was fresh and crisped. sliced cheese on top. on the side was warm fresh sliced french roll. altogether was delicious and filling. great customer service. he was friendly and attentive. the day was warm and sunny to enjoy over lunch. restaurant was on the nd floor of pier overlooking the pier water. if you are looking for great clam chowder , this is the place to be."
420,,Yol M.,1119,1.0,11/19/2016,we literally just ate there ordering crab cheesy toast and dungeness crab cakes . we only had eggs this morning. no sooner than walking away down embarcadero street my boyfriend began to feel nausea. as we walked a few more minutes he began to throw up near the shops. obviously food poison as he is not sick. his stomach hurt and could not keep down the crab cake ! so upsetting and disappointed
421,,Sudesna M.,1119,5.0,12/21/2015,"ambience romantic and scenic. we went around pm in summer and caught the alcatraz islands view in the sun, during sunset and after sunset. it was breathtaking. you can just stare at the bay forever. hubby tried merlot and it was good. the complimentary sourdough bread provided was perfect just the right taste. award winning clam chowder in bread bowl was rich and clamy we ordered the dungeness crab cakes they just melt in your mouth exquisite flavors. must recommended. lobster tail presentation of this dish was very creative and it tasted soft and succulent. fish and chips was not so great. desserts was vanilla bean creme brulee. its freaking awesome.must try."
422,,Samantha D.,1119,5.0,7/14/2015,"this place is amazing! the dungeness crab cakes are to die for! i had the clam chowder sourdough bread bowl with crab , and he had the crab sandwich. both were amazing! our server maron was the best! she made wonderful suggestions, and made the dining experience memorable!"
423,,Bridget L.,1119,3.0,7/9/2015,"like all of the other posts, this place is a tourist trap. my boyfriend and i sat at the bar since it was my birthday and we wanted to get drinks and apps. my margarita was decent but for i've had it better other places and his lagunita's small jar was . just another way to help tourist spend all their money except i'm not one. the bartenders were not even friendly and when mentioning it was my birthday he asked if i wanted a fireball shot. i was surprised assuming he was offering but then said no, we cannot give you free alcohol but i will give you dessert. i did not go in there looking to celebrate my birthday at pm but hey, i will take a dessert i suppose. once he was bringing the dessert we were getting our check. turns out he charged me for the damn dessert. . and i did not even ask for it. we got the dungeness crab cakes that seemed like they had a good amount of meat but it also had too much seasoning. i like crab cakes because i like the taste of crab . i actually ended up feeling sick after eating this meal."
424,,Calvin S.,1119,4.0,7/7/2014," . , +. for service well, fog harbor was my first dinner stop in my day trip down the west coast. our theme was seafood for our san francisco stops, since i personally have never been to the pacific coast and really wanted to test out what is so great about their seafood. we reserved via opentable and had to wait about minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served. our dinner included the award winning clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes , garlic roasted crab , wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. i understood america and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. the garlic roasted crab had to have been at least pounds, and i was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab although she did not even touch the corn cob and potatoes . the lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. the award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name creamy but not too creamy soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. the wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we could not finish it. the lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really did not taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders. service started brilliantly, and quite frankly i do not really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at and we were still eating at i did say the portions were huge!!! . we finally left around and were the last customers departing the restaurant, having finally experienced seafood in the west coast.miles better than the east coast."
425,,Linda H.,1119,3.0,4/30/2014,"i'm giving this place stars for service but stars for food. i guess that is why it comes out a . super smiling faces and genuinely nice people that work here but unfortunately have to serve mediocre food. and for these prices i do expect more flavors. their dungeness crab cakes were hugely disappointing with much more filler taste than crab . i do not know if they make their crab cakes fresh but if they did they still taste like preprocessed ones with lots of bread crumbs and salt added. even the remoulade sauce tasted processed also. i really wanted to like this place because the bartenders and drinks and hostess were excellent, but the food fell short."
426,,CC C.,1119,4.0,4/4/2014,"my eyes were bigger than my stomach here. had the free bleu cheese garlic bread with the starter dungeness crab cakes and house salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. it all tasted fine, but pricy for the portions that you are served. unable to stop myself, i also got the apple crisp for dessert and it was very good. my server was prompt, attentive, and friendly which made for a nice dining experience. also had an excellent view of the water. a nice place to eat on pier , but pricier. definitely not some place i would come to regularly, but a good place to eat if you are already down by the wharf."
427,,Racquel E.,1119,4.0,10/19/2013,"we had an early dinner and a nice view of pier . for appetizers, we had the dungeness crab cakes and our daughter had their award winning clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. hubby had the pacific sole with fingerling potatoes, spinach, peppers, tarragon & capers. i had the mixed grilled salmon, swordfish and shrimp, with citrus buerre blanc, wild rice and steamed broccoli. our daughter had the kids meal fried shrimp & french fries. the food was delicious, and we were too full for dessert. a couple of hours later, we were able to enjoy the fireworks display over the bay."
428,,Milton J.,1119,4.0,10/13/2013,"after a quick four and half hour bus tour of san francisco we had a couple of hours left before having to leave port for another destination on a cruise. after doing some research i came across fog harbor fish house at pier on a travel website which had a lot of positive reviews. upon arrival we waited for about fifteen minutes before being seated for a group of three at a corner not far from the crab house. we ordered two cups of clam chowder, and one in a sourdough bowl. apparently the basket of bread was sourdough, so the sourdough bowl was not necessary. the chowder was great as the restaurant claims the best in san francisco. we also ordered crispy bay scallops, dungeness crab cakes , and fried combo breaded fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries and cole slaw . based on the description lots of calories for sure. the scallops, calamari and crab cakes were the best of the lot. it felt like we consumed two meals at once given the portions but it was a great experience. a great way to finish a brief trip to san francisco."
429,,Zizzle f.,1119,4.0,10/13/2018,"hey, sometimes you just want the classics for which star is the highest rating unless you invented chowder in .ahem, for spot on seafood classics with all the ambiance of a classic san francisco establishment, fog harbor delivers! really good crab cakes balanced by a bright mango roasted red pepper arugula salad . cleaned, picked, immaculately chilled you grade prawns. smackin clam and bacon loaded chowder celery parsley notes . wedge with lots of bacon and veiny blue, nice bright heirlooms. my dear lobster tails were incredibly sweet and not over cooked. my guest had the cod which was a highlight dish perfect sear and todiefor white bean 'cassoulet' really the best dish of the evening . desert was an over the top blondie topped with carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream whip, carmel cookie crumble, walnut, mint leaf . it was good, rich as hell, but not great. the wine selection expensive but expansive. service was good and i know how hard they are working . dinner was overall amazing just the classics, respected and not pretentious. yeah so what i'm local. born and raised, and we really enjoyed sneaking into a 'touristy' place that does not get so many locals. gm was on his toes seating guests, hustling! you would be hard pressed to find a better fish dish then the cod, anywhere. fog harbor is my new favorite fish house in the bay!"
430,,Kai L.,1119,5.0,9/23/2018,"packed out on sunday but fortunately had nice water view seats! you can ask server to borrow portable charger if you need to juice up your phone. tried their lobster tails , clams, shrimp ."
431,,Elizabeth G.,1119,2.0,8/16/2018,"disappointing experience. positives friendly bartender, friendly waitress, great view, clean and spacious. these things are what earned stars. the other were lost due to the attitude of the hostesses and the poor quality of the food. we ordered the crab chicken cocktail and the lobster tails . the crab had no flavor and the lobster tasted like it had been microwaved. i am not sure if i would come back unless it was for a work party or something."
432,,Danielle M.,1119,1.0,7/29/2018,"unfortunately this star review is due to the fact that i got violently sick, after eating here last night. we had clam chowder and the shellfish platter for two with lobster tails . after taxes and tip we spent aout . it is unfortunate and unacceptable to get sick at a restaurant as expensive and well established as this. i have reached out to the establishment regarding my experience."
433,,Iris R.,1119,4.0,6/23/2018,"i made the conscious decision to eat at fog harbor fish house with my kids in our first visit to san francisco. there was no line but the place had lots of diners. although we were not given the window table, it was still a very nice experience to be guided to your table by affable attendants. my kids ordered their salmon children's meal and they had a great time waiting for their meal because of the crayons and the coloring papers. for myself, i splurged on lobster tails and crab cakes to share. i had anchor beer to wash it down. the lobster was fresh and just juicy. it was yummy! and the crab cakes! the kids really enjoyed their salmon and they said that it was the best they ever had! we did not wait that long for the food and we also did not dally long inside the restaurant. it was a splurge worth having!"
434,,Elain C.,1119,5.0,4/6/2018,"our second time to visit this great restaurant.it is located on the second level of pier . coming here with friends from outside california is a great treat. after showing them the famous fisherman's wharf, sealions and alcatraz. we make it a point that this would be the last stop of our tour of pier . we sat exactly on the same round table by the entrance. my family and guest were delighted to have bernie same server as my son vividly remembers him as suggested we had the platter for and added lobster tails . guest got mix grill and ahi .it s a must for my guest to try their famous chowder.they loved it. service was impeccable from the host to bernie's constant attendening to what my guest needs.clean bathroom. i would surely would come back in this restaurant if i have guest ."
435,,Jackie Q.,1119,4.0,3/23/2018,"loved my experience here! everything was fantastic, the restaurant has an upscale feel, and the wait was not too bad cuz good luck trying to get a sameday reservation . our waiter was sassy, but professional, and honestly the only complaint i have was the fact that the oysters were extremely small and had a rather dull taste. i had the lobster tails and if i ever had the heart to spend on one meal again, i would definitely reorder. had the apple crumble for dessert, it was on point! came with my family and we ended up spending a bit more than total, but it was well spent. i would definitely recommend for seafood lovers, but just a tip do not get the oysters. they are rather unappealing."
436,,George B.,1119,5.0,3/11/2018,excellent service and food. my kids had lobster tails and garlic roasted whole crab. my wife had penne chicken and i had combo grill. super tasty and server was very polite and professional. we will be back for sure.

438,,Kristel V.,1119,5.0,1/21/2018,"if you want fresh seafood, you better come here! was here for a weekend with friends and since we were in sf, we wanted seafood! we were seated by the window and had a nice view of the bay. some of us decided to order the shellfish platter good for people + lobster tails . i thought it would not be enough for me, so i ended up ordering the crab louie salad as well. omg, when the food came out, i was overwhelmed. the shellfish platter and my salad was huge! everything tasted so good though. shellfish platter was cooked with butter and tons of garlic. seafood was fresh and it was worth the price we paid. definitely coming back and ordering maybe just the shellfish platter next time. our waiter was as very nice as well. will be back!"
439,,Adrian A.,1119,5.0,1/6/2018,"after a second visit today, fog harbor fish house is now firmly on my list of seafood restaurants to go to when in sf. its location on pier might initially be a turnoff if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and do not relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. however, the food is worth it. luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. i would describe the interior of the restaurant as modern . the seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which i think was for walkins. large windows facing the moorings for the blue & gold tour boats let us lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables. the menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some nonseafood choices. as i understand it, fog harbor is part of the simmons family restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around pier . one thing to bear in mind is that this is the more proper of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result. you will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. on both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino seafood stew , the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. the seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. the main courses i ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. both dishes were phenomenal. one thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which i made a note of on my reservation, and our server kayla gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it! it was the tiramisu, which is definitely worth saving space for. in short, i am already looking forward to my next visit to fog harbor!"
440,,James M.,1119,5.0,11/12/2017,best fish restaurant on pier ! the ahi was to die for! the lobster tails were meaty not tiny little tails . the bread was to die for and the service was impeccable. i will say the lady in the front shirt with black hair was not all that nice but i can understand dealing with tourist all day can be tough! will come back next year! keep up the good work!
441,,Brittany M.,1119,5.0,10/18/2017,"this place is yummy! ordered a bowl of clam chowder and it was prob the best i've ever had. i also had the mussels fries and the fries are crisp! mussels are fresh, too. for my entree, i ordered the lobster tails which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. lobster tail was perfect and the mashed potatoes were creamy. service was great. our waitress was friendly and attentive. i would recommend this place for a great view of the bay & alcatraz."
442,,Joseph L.,1119,2.0,9/28/2017,"reserved for dinner about a month in advance for a special occasion for . i requested for a less busier window seating upon arrival. host had a bad attitude and told us to wait until she calls us. we should have walked away then. host sat us by the bar and very close to entrance of the building. we saw many tables available inside the room so we asked the host for another table further inside with less distractions. when we politely flagged the host as she passed by to request for another table, she spoke to us in a condescending manner and told us to figure it out with the server. their solution to our request was to move our table to a booth about feet away. another chance to just walk out but i did not want to spoil the occasion. we ordered crab cakes, dozen oysters, ciopinni with pasta, seafood platter for with lobster tails . the hospitality here does not match the price. we selected this restaurant because it was suppose to have a nice view and ambiance. we spent about for . i recommend spending your money where they appreciate your business."
443,,Becca S.,1119,5.0,9/28/2017,"amazing seafood spot! my dad was visiting my my fiance and i from hawai'i he knows seafood . our server alex i believe, was awesome and very helpful when it came down to deciding on what the heck we were going to get. he recommend the seafood platter, which has mussels, clams, crab and shrimp. my fiance got the shareable size for him and i. my dad and i each got the lobster tails . my fiance and i split my dish and the platter and it was sooooo much food! the shareable seafood platter is honestly good enough to share between people. if you get some appetizers and with all the bread they give you it is definitely a good way to all get down and chow down. the view is amazing and i will definitely be back again!"
444,,Alex R.,1119,4.0,9/6/2017,"good the food is very good. we had the bay scallops, mixed grill, and lobster tails all of it was tender, juicy and seasoned well. portions are not huge, but they are certainly big enough you will not leave unsatisfied. service is top notch. the server raphael made several good recommendations and was very sociable. he was attentive without being intrusive. ambiance. has a nice view of bay and the bridge and the decor is upscale without being gaudy. definitely had a great vibe to it. bad feels roughly % overpriced. definitely great for special occasions, but the prices mean this will probably not be a weekly event."
445,,Aaron E.,1119,3.0,7/2/2017,"had the oz lobster tails and the wife had the fried combo calamari, octopi, fish and shrimp with fries. the lobster was good but tough on top with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed squash. over all it was a good dish. wife's plate was meh. fish was gross. calamari and octopus was good and shrimp was ok. the star on that dish was the fench fries sad enough. came out to . meh"
446,,P M.,1119,2.0,6/19/2017,"one star for ambiance, one star for location. service was good but not great. food was mediocre. more than a couple dishes were dirty. drinks cognac neat, seemed like way less than a shot, more like . of an ounce starters shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail dinner lobster tails x . the lobster was either old and soggy or undercooked. absolutely unacceptable. mixed grill this meal was average. if the mashed potatoes were executed better i would have been ok with the meal. dungenous crab ravioli this was the best thing we ordered burger execution on special requests were not met bacon on side not in burger, mayo requested not served kind of dry but decent quality meat. dessert blondie highlight of the night, very rich."
447,,Donna G.,1119,2.0,6/11/2017,"disappointed! ate here last night. server justin said he was new to the restaurant so perhaps that explains the slow service and cold food. i ordered the lobster tails , chowder and a cocktail. waited nearly an hour for my entree, which was cold and bland when it arrived. had to ask for water twice before he brought it. noticed that the girls at the table next to us were served quickly and he spent a good deal.of time chatting with them and encouraging them to rate his service. not sure if they did, but i sure am! justin, as a former waitress i left you a bad tip, it takes a lot to get a bad tip from me. hope you learn quickly before you run off more customers like me, a bit older with money to spend. when i told you my food was cold you said sorry, took the plate away and that was it. when we were waiting nearly an hour for our food, you never once came to try table to reassure us that it was on the way. i will not be back."
448,,Mr B.,1119,5.0,6/2/2017,"amazing food and service. the sour dough bread was fresh, hot, and the best i have ever had. we had the spicy shrimp appetizer, the grill mix, and the lobster tails . i have never had such well cooked seafood. the whole experience was awesome and made one of the top things we did while in ca. thanks!"

450,,Mai N.,1119,3.0,10/13/2018,long wait but the food was not that great. average quality yet pricey. i ordered seafood pasta and ahi tuna rare seared which came out just ok. for both exluded drinks.

456,,Mike N.,1119,1.0,8/4/2018,"the restaurant has great ambience while still in the prime location of pier . however today i was deeply disappointed with their service. we had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. we had the award winning clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna . the clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. the crab cakes were good as well. i liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. but the service here, was just terrible. our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. we had to ask for everything, straws, etc . our table was never cleared at anytime either. all of our plates were just sitting on the table. i was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. the oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. the ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. after paying + dollars is this what i should expect by all means i have no issue spending money on food. but it really just hits a nerve when i get crappy service and i'm paying for it. i would go else where if your thinking about the fog harbor fish house."
457,,Sandy B.,1119,5.0,8/4/2018,"this is my favorite restaurant! i took my husband for our th year anniversary. the service was way beyond our expectations. curtis and ashley both made it a memorable meal for both my husband and i. the food was superb we had the ahi tuna appetizer, and we split the pacific sole, and tiramisu on the house for our anniversary which was so sweet. we look forward to coming again hopefully in the near future. thank you!!"
458,,Ella H.,1119,4.0,7/30/2018,"we have visited once a year, years running. the chowder is superb, except for the bacon they put in this fish dish. aka please stop get the extra crab on top you will not regret it. the seared ahi tuna melts in your mouth. grab a bottle of kunde sauvignon blanc it will enhance any meal. the wait staff is typically very accommodating, timely, and personable which only adds to this great experience. hostesses are apparently stressed due to their curt responses. would have been stars but for the hostesses & disgusting restroom that smelled like it had not been cleaned in hot years the rr not the hostess do not forget to get the hour validation ticket from your server! bon appetit!"
459,,Cath C.,1119,5.0,7/8/2018,"great service! we waited mins for a window seating! great view of the waterfront! our waiter had great suggestion off their menu! order scallop and crab meat risotto summer menu, not sure if its available year round , ahi tuna poke, clam chowder sourdough bowl! clam chower was super creamy with lots of ingredients, the sourdough bowl was warm unlike other places near fisherman's wharf that serves the bowl cold! risotto was delicious, did not overpower the crab meat at all!"
460,,Frank D.,1119,5.0,6/16/2018,the seafood was very fresh and well prepared. the ahi tuna was very flavorful. justin was our waiter and he did a great job taking care of us. we will definitely ask for him next time.
461,,Jax W.,1119,4.0,6/16/2018,by far the best thing i've had since being in san fran. got the ahi tuna steak and it made my taste buds jump! it truly just melted in my mouth. i can not wait to return one day to have this again. the mix drinks were fair. the atmosphere seemed like it was trying to be a bit classier but there was a lot more casual feel to it. overall service was decent. the view if you get seated well is enjoyable.
462,,Sarah M.,1119,5.0,6/4/2018,"i am horrified that i forgot our waitress's name, as she was just the sweetest and most patient woman and everything you could ever hope for with your dining experience . i literally told her, thank you for being so wonderful at the end of the night. we went around pm with no reservations on a tuesday night, and were still given a table overlooking the water. our waitress was super sweet and answered our , questions about the menu. we felt welcome, respected, and free to explore the menu. most importantly, the food was amazing!!! locally sourced and perfect. the blue cheese bread appetizer was fantastic, and the ahi tuna was firm yet melted in your mouth, and the halibut was just phenomenal. best meal i have probably ever had in my life. thank you all so much! it was a special night for us, and you made it perfect!!"
463,,Warren S.,1119,5.0,5/30/2018,"this is the first seafood spot i've been to in san francisco and they set the bar high! starters, the location is gorgeous. overlooking the bay, great lighting, and easy to get to. the service was friendly, gave great suggestions, and seemed genuine with their guests. i did not partake in the drinks or desert but from what i saw they looked great as well. now, the food. the food was amazing! potentially the best calamari i have ever had pictures included and the ahi tuna with mixed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes was cooked to perfection. i work without question recommend this to others as well as be a returning customer in my future endeavors in san francisco!"
464,,Michelle S.,1119,5.0,5/7/2018,"ordered the ahi tuna poke appetizer, lettuce wedge, and crab cocktail. the first two were superbly done, very flavorful. i could have done without the crab i thought it would be lump meat but it was sort of in shreds. do not miss the complimentary warm sourdough bread with butter! so good!! also had the mojito to drink and it was exquisite. of course it all was pricey but that seems to be the way of san francisco. bon appetit!"
465,,Meghan P.,1119,5.0,4/10/2018,"wow!!! this restaurant is amazing. i was out in the city with a good friend and she recommended we go to this restaurant for lunch. i was not disappointed. they served warm fresh sourdough bread while waiting for our entrees. the butter was perfectly salted and room temperature which i love. i ordered the half soup salad. i got the cesar salad with clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. it was more than filling i was not able to finish it all. good thing i had my husband there to help me out. my husband ordered the ahi tuna entree which he let me have a little of. the ahi tuna was seared and coated with sesame seeds but rare on the inside. it had great flavor and melted in your mouth. it was served with rice with an amazing soy lime sauce that had a yummy smoky flavor. it was also served with vegetables. my friend got the mixed grill which came with salmon, cod and shrimp along with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. we all left very full and satisfied. this restaurant has tons of yummy seafood options. i cannot wait to come back to this restaurant and test out the other entrees."
466,,Michelle H.,1119,5.0,3/29/2018,"amazing food!!! the clam chowder was one of the best i have had and i am from ma . bf had the filet, it was so tender and had so much flavor with the mushroom sauce topped with crumbled blue cheese. i had the ahi tuna , seared to perfection, with a wasabi aioli. definitely recommend if in the san fran area."
467,,Michelle H.,1119,5.0,1/5/2018,i highly recommend coming here at opening. you will have a higher chance of getting a window seat and getting a great view of the harbor and the pier. the ahi tuna was delicious and grilled shrimp entree. the restaurant also serves complimentary warm sourdough bread. they also serve delicious freshly squeezed orange juice and lemonade. they also have a great selection of desserts. the service was also amazing. the restaurant is clean and romantic.
468,,Jennie N.,1119,5.0,12/30/2017,"i usually void fisherman's wharf especially around the holidaysgetting run over by strollers and pedestrians just are not my thang but i was in a rather cheery mood and decided to take in the christmas decorations before they get torn down. we decided to have dinner at fog harbor fish house thanks to yelp reviews and they did not disappoint. for starters, we had the calamari, red chili garlic shrimp and mussel fries. all were quite tasty, particularly the garlic shrimp. that sauce had the right amount of spice and kick. we followed with their award winning clam chowder in a bread bowlthick and creamy with plenty of clam chunks. just yums! for the main course, we ordered the cioppino, ahi tuna and seafood penne. my little tot had the chicken tenders. all are highly recommended including the tendersvery meaty and well.tender. everything was great but what really brought this review from a star experience to is our waiter, justin. he was accommodating and made sure our dinner experience was an unforgettable one. we were all pleasantly surprised by justin's attentiveness, how fresh the food was and our overall experience considering the restaurant is in a tourist trap. if you are in the area and do not mind the wait and the crowds, fog harbor is worth the visit."
469,,Lindsay C.,1119,4.0,10/20/2018,"seafood party! love that you get on the wait list via yelp and avoid waiting around uncessarily. the clam chowder here was so amazing! it was creamy with pieces of clams and potato and i wanted to lick the bowl. scallop, crab, and clam risotto was pretty tasty at first bite but once i had a bite of the seafood penne pasta it was like move over risotto. red sauce better than white sauce ftw. the seafood on the penne pasta was cooked to perfection and i found myself dipping into this dish more than my own. the risotto i thought needed to be cooked more. it was not as creamy as i prefer risotto to be. it was still good but i would get the penne pasta next time. the tiramisu was delish. it was a bit more chocolatey but still light with hints of expresso. service was great and i could see myself coming back for more clam chowder."
470,,Danielle P.,1119,5.0,10/5/2018,"i spent the weekend in sf with my mom and her one request was that she have scallops for dinner, her fav! after some yelping around, i chose fog harbor and made a reservation online. located on the nd floor of the pier strip, you get a pretty awesome view, day or night. we requested a seat by the window and were accommodated with no problem. the service was good and the food was great. we started with the shrimp cocktail, i highly recommend. my mom had the special crab risotto with scallops, she loved this dish. everything was perfectly cooked. i went with the seafood penne , also so good! the dish was packed full of clams, mussels, crab, shrimp, scallops.too much for me to eat on my own even though i tried so hard overall the view of the water along with a great meal was a perfect ending to our night."
471,,Dan S.,1119,3.0,9/20/2018,the best part about this place was the bread before the meal. my girlfriend got the garlic shrimp. i hate when places burn shrimp on the skewer to a crisp. their mashed potatoes were literally nothing more than mashed. potatoes. no salt or butter just bland the sauteed spinach if they were sauteed at all was only in the pan for a couple seconds. when i told the waiter he said that is the way they saute it. im sorry man the way you do it is wrong. i had the seafood penne it was just alright nothing special to be over dollars. someone tell me how this place is stars because to me it is overrated. i do not know if it was star bad but it was not good.
472,,Cynthia D.,1119,4.0,9/15/2018,"amazing spot for great food with view of alcatraz and the pier. my party of four enjoyed our seafood dinner here and the sunset view was gorgeous. for appetizer, i tried the clam chowder in the bread bowl which was really creamy and tasty, fresh oysters freakin' delicious, and even the baked oysters were noteworthy, and the crab cakes were to die for! for entrees, we got the seasonal jumbo scallop and crab meat risotto and the seafood penne . both were solid dishes! i loved the crab flavor in the risotto. infamous restaurant in fisherman's wharf whereas the wait can be for hours. luckily for us, yelp waitlist was the mvp! i wish more restaurants implement this in nyc. i simply opened my handy yelp app and tapped to join the waitlist must be within miles while i was commuting from my hotel in lower haight. it would give me an estimated time to check in with the hostess and approximately how many parties are ahead of us. my friends and i were exploring fisherman's wharf the entire time until time got closer. ta da!"
473,,Eliza I.,1119,5.0,9/10/2018,"best restaurant in fisherman's wharf! delicious food with excellent services. calamari was fried to perfection, flavorful creamy seafood penne and yummy creme brulee. truly enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come again in next trip!"
474,,Carinna L.,1119,2.0,9/10/2018,"we were excited to try out this local joint as seattle locals visiting from out of town. for the price, location, and food selection we had decent expectations. we started with alcoholic beverages which were decent, but did not taste like much alcohol was in them. we ordered appetizers of calamari and clam chowder which was quite delicious. no complaints there. however, our entrees came out and that is when our experience took a nosedive. the table ordered the recommended dishes such as the seafood penne and the fish and chips. the battered fish was bland and tasteless, and the seafood penne pasta left more to be desired. the sauce was so thin it slid right off the pasta leaving a plain noodle. the service was awful, and i'm pretty sure the server was high the entire time. i expected a lot more from a nicer restaurant and wish we had chosen a different place."
475,,Charity M.,1119,5.0,9/4/2018,"i am never the one to write reviews, but fog harbor left me no choice! i had the clam chowder, & i can see why it is award winning! i also had the seafood penne sublinguine it was amazing! i do not eat cilantro, & they had no problem making me a new dish without cilantro! our server ashley was nothing short of amazing. ashley's customer service was the best i've had in a long time! i am huge on customer service. my experience overall was dope! i will be back really soon!"
476,,Jes S.,1119,5.0,9/2/2018,"located in pier , this restaurant is definitely worth waiting in line for. tip luckily you can join the waitlist via yelp , to cut your waiting time shorter! i had the seafood penne with generous portions of fish, mussels, clams, and shrimp and also tried the dungenous crab, clam chowder and the calamari all of which tasted divine! highly recommend the clam chowder!"
477,,AnnMarie J.,1119,5.0,8/17/2018,ordered the seafood penne and the risotto and both were spectacular. make reservations two days or more in advanced if possible. love this place and will be back!
478,,Sheila E.,1119,5.0,8/17/2018,"had the seafood penne and the sole. both were very good. the penne was very flavorful and the sole was refreshing. i would order either of them again, although i would want to try the ahi next. i love that you can put yourself on the waitlist via yelp so we could wander around. our friend had their dog from site seeing all day and was glad that the restaurant could still accommodate us."
479,,Neda A.,1119,5.0,5/27/2018,"this place is great! the clam chowder was so creamy and like none other. the calamari as well as the seafood penne was delightful. finally, justine our server was extremely attentive and friendly. i would highly recommend this place!"
480,,Fanny S.,1119,5.0,5/14/2018,"this was the best thing that i had on my san francisco trip! the food was delicious, and the service was great! we ordered the shellfish platter with a lobster, the seafood penne , which were all delicious, but the show stopper was the scallops and crab risotto. that was so delicious! there are four scallops that are beautifully cooked, and they were seasoned perfectly. the risotto itself was great, but i feel like it could have had a bit more flavor. if you can go, definitely go, and try those things listed above, especially the crab risotto. you can enjoy the view while having a delicious meal!"
481,,Babs L.,1119,5.0,5/8/2018,"amazing place! my two girls had salmon and i had the seafood penne . omg, so amazing! calamari appetizer is a must. my yo had the kids fish and chips and we took one bite and that was it. dry and bland so do not bother with wasting on kids meal. the bread. oh the bread. dreaming about it still."
482,,Scott L.,1119,5.0,4/19/2018,"when every place on a monday night is dead in the harbor area, but fog harbor fish house is bumpin then yeah you know this place is awesome. i would recommend making a reservation no matter the night as this place is right on the water and the food service is amazing. clam chowder lives up to the hype and i made the rookie mistake of not getting it in the bread bowl. they have great bread that they give you before the meal. any place that gives me breads always has a special place in my heart. i ordered the seafood penne which was bomb and very reasonably priced. the service is excellent and it feels like seconds after you order, the food is at the table. if i come back to san francisco, i will make sure to eat here again as it was the best restaurant i went to during my trip."
483,,Joseph V.,1119,5.0,4/14/2018,"excellent food, good atmosphere, justin made it very nice. we liked the seafood penne and the shrimp brochette. both excellent."
484,,Natasha R.,1119,5.0,2/28/2018,"while the hubs and i are on our way to our goto spot to get our crab craving fix, on a whim we decided to try some place new, and boy i do not regret that decision one bit! we agreed on fog harbor fish house based on their yelp reviews thank you, fellow yelpians . we started with the calamari. mouth.watering. it is the jalapenos, i swear! and to top it off with the lemon aioli. i died, inside. happily. the shellfish platter is a must! the hubs is a big guy, so the platter for two plus the lobster was filling for him. i feel as though if he were to have bought it for , he would be asking for a snickers bar drumroll, with a hit of the symbols bam . shellfish platter for two came with whole crab, clams, shrimp and mussels. we added a lobster for an additional cost. the seafood penne was satisfying. not as much flavor as i wished for, but i guess it is expected when you have a variety of seafood in a pasta i'm assuming they were trying to put an emphasis in the seafood , rather than seasoning it up and hiding the seafood's natural flavor. and i am not mad at that. and to end our beautiful experience almost cried because desserts are always a reminder that you are almost done i could not help, but salivate over their apple crisp. lord, help me. just screw this review and go and get yourself a seat at this place."
485,,Tori G.,1119,5.0,2/25/2018,"the food here is so good and the seafood is so fresh! i ordered the seafood penne and my mother ordered a crab sandwich and both meals were delicious. the sauce they used in my pasta was outstanding, i could not get enough of it and the chicken, mussels, and other seafood i found inside my pasta was fantastic. in fact it was my first time ever trying mussels, and this restaurant has me hooked. unfortunately i have not experienced any other restaurant that matches the yumminess of this one though! there is plenty of seating and did not have to witness any wait. the waiter was very nice and quick to serve us. the view and ambiance was also really quite wonderful. parking could be a problem for some people, yet if you are familiar with san francisco you should know public transportation or walking is really the most viable way to get around. i'm so excited to eat here again"
486,,R A.,1119,4.0,2/23/2018,"the food was fantastic and the view was great. we arrived for an early dinner. i knocked one star off since our first server was passing out water and reached across the table and said to my mother take the glass, honey. not only is that condescending but it is a sign of an improperly trained server as you should never hand something to a patron. the shift was changing so luckily that server was replaced with someone more professional. cocktails, appetizers, entrees and dessert.no complaints! some standouts were the crab cakes, bleu cheese garlic bread not overwhelmingly bleu definitely try , mixed seafood penne and special entrees. take a peek at the oldschool dessert tray and you will not be able to resist!"
487,,Sussie C.,1119,5.0,2/15/2018,excellent! had the seafood penne mixed grill fried calamari red chili garlic shrimp all amazing! highly recommend!
488,,Sean M.,1119,5.0,2/12/2018,we had a meal for our yr anniversary. the seafood penne and bread bowl clam chowder were excellent picks. they even gave us a complimentary dessert.
