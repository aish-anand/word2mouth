1,Gauri H.,1111,5,11/3/18,oldest steakhouses in new york .great quality of steak. very flavorful. the steak was days old steak
2,Jason M.,1111,5,10/19/18,"wow! incredible meal indeed.i came her for a friday lunch with my girlfriend and we were impressed from staff to finish. when you first walk in, you will notice that old school classic ny steakhouse feel that adds to the charm and history of the restaurant.we were immediately sat, it did not look particularly busy on this afternoon. we ordered the day dryaged prime ribeye steak, the heritage pig bolognese and a side of delmonico's potatoes. no drinks for us on particular day but the wine list was extensive and looked impressive. the whole drink menu was actually displayed on an ipad that the waiter hands to you which i thought was very cool.first, the day dryaged prime ribeye steak. just wow. it might be the best steak i've had so far in this city. cooked to a perfect mediumrare, the inside was succulently juicy while the outside had a nice charred crunch to it. you can really taste the dryaged flavor. some restaurants in the city will say their steak is dryaged for x amount of days meanwhile having no dryaged flavor but this steak, you can really tell by the flavor that it is real.next, the heritage pig bolognese . wow again. it is large rigatoni pasta with a bolognese sauce made with pig cheeks. the pasta was made a perfect al dente, just how i like it. i'm a pasta fiend and this one flies straight to the top of my list for pasta dishes in the city. must try.last we tried the delmonico's potatoes. it was sort of a like hot potato salad with more of a consistency of gravy. good but skippable. probably better sides on the menu.overall, amazing flavor experience at delmonico's. the steak and the pasta were to die for and prices are typical of nyc steakhouses. i will be coming back again."
3,Marisa S.,1111,5,10/11/18,"went here on a date because my date saw it on john wick. when we got here we read up on the history of the restaurant & how it was the first fine dining establishment in america.we both extremely enjoyed the atmosphere & definitely had the best fine dining experience thanks to the helpful staff.my date ordered the signature delmonico's steak and i ordered the lamb chops. we had a started of west coast oysters then for our side orders we had mash potatoes and asparagus. i can for the first time say when i tasted the lamb chops and steak, i cried. i cried tears of joy because it was absolutely the most delicious meat to ever hit my tastebuds. however, the most surprising thing was the simple mashed potatoes and asparagus being absolutely perfected. lastly, the west coast oysters came with three different sauces to try them with and i can happily say i enjoyed every slurp.i would absolutely recommend taking anyone here to have the best full experience of fine dining."
4,Chris L.,1111,5,10/7/18,i do not know what to say but simply one of the best dinners and steaks that i've ever had. surely in the top three. it was expertly cooked and every bite was delicious to the last. it was sad it ended but if i go back to nyc it is comforting knowing delmonico's is there.the bread they brought while i waited was good. the fries that cane with the meal were scrumptious too. i was very happy i went there and would highly recommend to anyone.
5,Dolonchapa C.,1111,5,8/26/18,"we came here for restaurant week. they are one of the few places that keep a decent restaurant week menu.started with the salad the one with the blue cheese. i generally do not like blue cheese but they did a fantastic job of balancing out the pungency with the veggies.loved it.a good steakhouse does not go wrong with steaks. on the rare side my steak was pink and juicy when you cut into it. the broccoli was brilliant. nicely cooked but somehow had a semi crispy outside.the mashed potatoes were not fancy like you get at some places but the comfort kind. highly recommend getting a standard steak, veggies, and potatoes.the baked alaska was good. it is marshmallows so yeah it is on the sweeter side. their chocolate mousse was dope.we tried heir house chardonnay and it went incredibly well with our food. we had a great time and looking forward to revisit already."
6,Jelena P.,1111,5,10/15/18,"amazing good , the ribeye was amazingly cooked and the side of mushrooms tasted great, dessert was heavenly!service was amazing, i sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive and friendly!"
7,Kristy B.,1111,5,7/26/18,"i'm so glad that i started my restaurant week with ny's oldest restaurant in the history. at first, i was skeptical seeing some of the not so good reviews but honestly, everything is great. let me first start with the servers. they are extremely accommodating. exactly know what we are looking for. we had some of our vegetarian coworkers with us. there were not too many veggie options in the menu.yet they agreed to create an entree portion out of the veggie appetizer and we did not even put efforts to explain it.wine was priced reasonably for a bottle during lunch. ambience is pretty historical and fancy. loved it!! it is a huge place as well. food was eclectic. my friends enjoyed their naked ravioli while i enjoyed my lobster newberg and salmon. i was super full as i kept hogging my two course meal. although lobster newberg as an appetizer was a additional than pre fixe restaurant week meal but was happy that i tried the lobster dish.okay so for the steak my coworker got this prime delmonico steak and it was so tasteful."
8,Melissa D.,1111,5,10/7/18,everyone brags about this place so i had to give it a shot during restaurant week with my friends! i absolutely loved it. the service was fast and the steak was just delicious. i cannot ask for better service! i will definitely be coming back.
9,Vivian M.,1111,3,6/30/18,"skip the diamond jim crispy oysters appetizer, it was very underwhelming. the king crab mac and cheese was disappointing and overall overhyped. the fries were bland also. some parmesan or truffle oil would have saved it though.the onion rings were delicious! it was crispy and airy. we opted to get the blue cheese dressing on the side so we can dip it instead and we did not want soggy onion rings. the charred corn and creamed spinach were sound choices. i definitely recommend getting them.i tried my brother's signature steak aka the ribeye. it was delicious! i might have liked his more than mine. my boyfriend and i shared the dry aged tomahawk. it was delicious but i think the signature steak was better bang for the buck.the drinks were a little bit overpriced but my mojito was perfect. it was just strong enough for me to taste the booze, but it was also minty, sweet and acidic.overall, this is not the best steakhouse in nyc. but i had a great time and i loved how we got a private room! we did not have to scream across the table to hear one another. it was great that we were able to dine and chat in our own pace. the main dining room was really loud, it would have definitely lowered the ambience of the restaurant if we were sat there."
10,Andrey R.,1111,3,11/6/18,"this place is old school. the steaks themselves are good. however, in general the food is very heavy and makes you to fall asleep right after you finish it. the service is good. it worth trying only once."
11,Edward C.,1111,3,6/8/18,"to celebrate my sister's birthday, and continue a birthday tradition, it was time for some steak!for this birthday, she decided she wanted to visit the venerable delmonico's.decor is what you would expect from a restaurant touted to go back to , with a dark interior befitting candlelight, oil paintings on the wall, dark wooden furniture, and white tablecloths.our starter was dipaolo's burrata. the herb pesto and fresh burrata made for a tasty herbaceous and rich combination. the only negative being the overly buttery garlic toast which was pretty greasy.for our entrees we both had scanned the menu the day before and she ordered the signature delmonico steak, and i had my stomach set on the day dryaged prime ribeye.the restaurant's namesake steak equivalent to a boneless ribeye was delicious from what my sister proclaimed and bestowed with some pieces i also agreed.there was plenty of beef flavor despite being only wetaged, a great distribution of tasty beef fat, and a nice crisp sear on the steakhowever, i was left a bit disappointed. it was a very good steak and cooked to my desired mediumrare, but concerning taste i was expecting the touted day dryaging to impart more flavor. i found the flavor and texture of my sister's signature delmonico wetaged, prime boneless ribeye steak better. it also helped that the delmonico was cut visibly thicker than my steak. delmonico's does not list sizes of their steak on their menu, so in my best estimation, i think my ribeye was somewhere around oz oz, with my sister's delmonico weighing in around oz. oz.we both found the crispy string of onions served on top of the steak pretty lifeless in flavor, and in my opinion actually detracted from the eyeappeal of the steak.for side dishes, we were deciding beforehand what to order and decided on the roasted cauliflower and the housecut french fries.roasted cauliflower was okay, with each floret being of good size and seasoned well. i enjoyed the little pickled raisins, but could not discern the listed manchego cheese nor truffle honey.the hohum sounding housecut french fries were delicious and even more welcome was the aioli dip served on the side. fries were cut long & thick, crisp, and seasoned perfectly.the ailoi was creamy, but balanced well with a hit of either garlic and onion.no birthday meal is complete without dessert, and at delmonico's one has to try the famous baked alaska.we had pretty mild expectations for the baked alaska due to it is pretty mundane ingredients, but would up enjoying it immensely. the warm toasted and fluffy light meringue playing against the cool semisolid ice cream provided a awesome contrast in texture. especially tasty was the distinct flavor of the banana ice cream too!we added another dessert in delmonico's profiterole donut.the nearblack chocolate syrup poured on top was fabulously rich and dark chocolate tasting with just a mild sweetness.i would buy gallons of this black gold!not to be overlooked were the caramelized macadamia nuts garnished on top which were sweet and crunchy, pairing in texture to the softer components.surprisingly, the decadent ingredients did not translate to an overly heavy dessert in my opinion. the profiterole itself was very airy and the cream was very light.finally, service was just okay, but not to my standards for a renowned restaurant in this price range.some points contributing to my opinion our waiter failed to ask us about refilling our drinks despite us finishing our drinks halfway into the meal. in fact, i believe he only came by once to ask us how our dinner experience was going. we waited nearly minutes before finally having to gesture for the waiter to get the check.while delmonico's is certainly worth a visit just to say you have eaten here, in my opinion, if you are weighing delmonico's against other top nyc steakhouses, i would maybe look elsewhere."
12,Ka Yi W.,1111,5,9/25/18,first time trying this restaurant and it was fantastic. the staff was friendly and the restaurant was beautiful. it is one of the oldest restaurants in nyc. the food was delicious and steak was cooked perfectly. everything was just perfect and amazing!
13,Diogenes M.,1111,3,6/29/18,"came in for lunch to the grille. had the classic burger with cheddar and bacon, cooked medium rare , fries, and an ipa. the ambience was probably the best part, service was great, burger as just average. the fries were also average. for the price i expected better than average. i guess it is just a burger and will try something else next time, but overall was disappointed.also, the place was not busy, we just walked in and were seated right away. we were also offered seating in the main dining room so i do not think they differentiate as much for lunch."
14,Christina F.,1111,5,8/23/18,one of a kind dining experience in financial district. they are said to have opened the first fine dining restaurant in the country. appetizers b.l.t. wedge burrata dinner day dryaged bonein rib eye delmonico steak our signature steak sides delmonico potatoes roasted button mushrooms dessert vanilla cr ] are me brulee service ambience cannot wait to come back!
15,Dennis L.,1111,5,5/19/18,"ah!!! steakhouse in nyc yep!this is one of the historical looking buildings with amazing steak. you cannot book a reservation same day at least i could not . so they said for me to arrive around pm and ask to sit at the bar. i guess the bar has a lot of open seats.anyway i arrived on a saturday at pm. once entering, the hostess let me have a table for !! no wait!! how freaking amazing !!! so happy!!i ordered the delmonicos signature steak. medium rare. cooked to perfection! it was so delicious. did not need any sauces on it either. just some salt and pepper. woot woot! on this steak for this item.for the side, i ordered the king crab mac and cheese!!! for this. this was really good. i enjoyed eating this. !want to know the best part my wife and i do not eat large portions so the server said he would cut up the steak so we could share. so freaking amazing. the signature plate came with some onion frits also. yum yum yum! it was a lot of food for ! great deal for great steak folks!"
16,William H.,1111,5,11/8/18,"recently had an enjoyable dining experience here at delmonico's. all the food they served was wellcooked. the staff was warm and courteous, the atmosphere relaxing and intimate. if ever you dine here, i would like to recommend the braised ribs, crispy oyster and the shrimp cocktail. this place is not disappointing. a must visit."
17,Jane C.,1111,4,8/8/18,"to start i would give this place a . and the only reason why it is docked anything is due to the affordability.definitely not somewhere you just pop in to get a meal. my friends and i reserved a table for here for the restaurant week prix fixe dinner. our reservation was at pm on a friday night and it was not very crowded when we were seated.located in the financial district and titled the oldest restaurant in nyc , i was excited to see that iconic flat ironesque building structure, but they were doing some construction or renovations so i only saw scrim covering the entire front entrance of the building. anyway, it was still nice on the inside and such a pleasant escape from the summer heat and humidity. there was still a good enough selection on the restaurant week menu. i decided to get the naked ravioli as the appetizer, the sirloin for the entree and opted for the supplement to get the baked alaska for dessert. my husband opted for the supplement to get the lobster newberg for the appetizer. seeing as how these two items debuted at delmonico's we thought that there was no better time or place to try them.before the meal even came out, we got a basket of bread and whipped and piped! butter. the flavor of the bread was really tasty and a little sweet, not very light, almost as if it was like a soda bread.the naked ravioli comes out with pieces of ravioli in a mushroom lemon sauce with some peas, parm, and microgreens. i do not quite remember what it was filled with but it was cheesy. the skin was a little thick, but still pleasant. my husband got the lobster newberg and i got to try some and it was really delicious. the roasted sirloin was amazing, i think it is a oz serving. it was really well seasoned and only cooked to one temperature, medium. i think the cook was closer to a medium rare, but i was not complaining at all, the cook was perfect. i tried a piece of my friend's filet mignon and i personally preferred the sirloin. if i can dare to say it, i think the sirloin was even softer than the filet and on top of that sirloin in general is a more flavorful cut of meat. i do not know if they mashed the fingerling potatoes, but the potatoes were amazingly smooth and buttery beyond belief. the broccoli was not bad either. the baked alaska was a true treat to look at. to be honest, as glad as i am to have tried it, i probably would not get it from here again if i was given the chance. it was a bit underwhelming to me. it was a spiced walnut cake with banana gelato on top, covered in a meringue and toasted served with an apricot coulis. i think the texture of the cake was a little crumby and was not the most enjoyable to me. since this was my first time trying baked alaska i cannot compare it with anything or have a standard for it. the amount of meringue was a little too much for me as well. i really did like having it with the apricot coulis though as it was a nice sharp contrast to the sweet and creamy flavor profiles.the service was very good and our waiter definitely knew what he was doing and knew how to work in that caliber of a restaurant, but it was a little intimidating. i am left handed so when i moved my spoon from the right side to the left side for dessert he very pointedly slid it over from the left side to the right side before putting my dessert down. i understand there are a lot of restaurant etiquette rules so as a diner who does not frequent very fancy restaurants it was a little intimidating and i felt a little out of my element. our waiter did a very good job though.i'm glad we were able to try delmonico's for restaurant week, and i'm glad that i will be able to say i've dined here before and tried the lobster newberg and baked alaska."
18,Jasmine S.,1111,5,8/23/18,"took our friend here to enjoy a birthday dinner in nyc. they were very accommodating our later flights and moving our reservations down. i was slightly disappointed that the front of the iconic building was getting a facelift so we could not take a picture in front. we were seated right away, and our waiter was prompt with providing us with water and bread.we all ordered the delmonico's steak please note that this steak is oz. we had no idea! it came out huge! that is what she said the steak was cooked perfectly and fatty. we also ordered their table onion rings really delicious , crab mac n cheese, and whipped mash potatoes. we were absolutely stuffed everyone but person was struggling to finish. myself including had so much trouble trying to finish it and failed.the service was great, i doubt our glasses were empty for more then minutes.the dress code of this restaurant is a bit questionable, as some people came in wearing tshirt, shorts and sneakers.if we are back in nyc we will definitely come again!"
19,Felicia M.,1111,5,8/7/18,"i do not even know where to start, delmonico's is amazing! as soon as i found out the dates for restaurant week i zoomed over to open table to lock down a reservation since delmonico's always books up fast. i was here a couple weeks for dinner at pm it as busy but not crazy and where do i begin.the soft romantic lighting gave it this classy yet sexy feel i felt like i transported back in time to the s. the waiters dressed alike, they were kind, very formal and attentive. the high ceilings made me feel like i was in a grand hall. ok, ok, i will get to the food now.the bf and i started off with the crispy oyster jim brady bacon relish, and ho jo tartar sauce. this was off the restaurant week menu and it was well worth it the crunch on the oyster was perfect, it tasted amazing. there were or i cannot remember because they went so fast. we ordered the special feature restaurant week bottle of wine for dollars it was a cab sav and it was excellent, went perfectly with the meal. we went on to order our apps i got the seasonal summer soup, which was a cold avocado soup, it was very good, i just wish i got something it bit heartier since i really was not in the mood for a cold soup, either way, it was good. the bf got the naked ravioli which was sweet peas, wild mushrooms, preserved meyer lemon and parmesan. i did not even know what he got because it went so fast, he loved it. i had plate envy and i did not even see it lol .now to the main event.dinner. i ordered the petit filet mignon, which came with mash potatoes and seasonal veggies broccoli and the bf got prime delmonico rib eye supplement it came with the same sides i had. let me tell you, we both cut into our steaks and ate the first piece and looked at each other and said wow, i do not know if it happened exactly like that, but something to that effect. we were in awe! my filet mignon was like butter, it was smooth, rich, salted perfectly, mediumrare, and just a slice of heaven. the mash potatoes, well first off there was just not enough if i would have known how good they were i would have ordered a side! the broccoli was great too they were baked and had a bit of crunch, i really enjoyed it since i'm a big baked broccoli fan! i, of course, had to try the rib eye and, damn it was good! next time, because there will be one, i'm going to go for that since it was obvi a bigger piece of meat and just tasty as hell!the finale was the classic baked alaska supplement , which is walnut cake, apricot jam, banana gelato, and meringue! wow it was like slicing into heaven, my spoon glided right through and it took me to the promise land. it was light, fluffy, sweet, and simple, yet delicious. the perfect way to end a perfect dinner.i never gloated like this about any restaurant, it was such a great experiencefrom the attentive service to the atmosphere, everything exceeded my expectations. worth every penny, get in there as soon as possible! i will be back without a doubt!"
20,Via G.,1111,4,11/4/18,"delmonico's is a steadfast piece of the concrete jungle with a side of strong bull. you have to come here just because it is everything nyc represents class, energy, fashion, money, youth, sophistication and medium red meat. tomahawk steak was great. made to order medium as we like it. service is pristine in this low light, wood trim classic restaurant. sides were okay. get your meat and close your eyes when you chew. take it allllll in!"
21,Catherine N.,1111,4,9/20/18,once the best steakhouse in the world. we began with lobster bisque then we each ordered the steak of choice. two hadfiletmignonand i had the famous delmonico steak au poive. the bisque sadly was a great disappointment. we complained to each other as we were eating it but that was it. we did not return it. definitely the chef was off on that one. our steaks were delicious and the choices of sides were great. we did not have dessert this time because the offering was not appealing as in the past. i was somewhat disappointed but i will not write them off.
22,Andrew C.,1111,4,7/31/18,"decided to kickstart restaurant week with one of the oldest steakhouses in new york. we came for dinner as we wanted to try theirfiletmignon.we arrived a few minutes early before our pm reservation but had to wait a bit because a lot of other people also made reservations. restaurant week brings everyone out! we got seated and got right to ordering!for an appetizer, i ordered the tomato salad. salad was pretty salad, nothing too special but we did not come for salad. we also had fries. they were fantastic, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crisp. for our entree, we both got thefiletmignon, medium rare. it came out in a timely fashion for a restaurant that was pretty busy. as soon as it came out, we got to cutting.steak was amazing. perfectly medium rare with pink on the inside. thefiletwas so tender and easy to cut. the meat was very flavorful and did not require extra sauce. each bite made me want more. i can see why this place has the reputation they do.for dessert, i got the chocolate mousse cake. it was good, not overly sweet and quite interesting as they seem to have some sort of water base, adding a crunchy texture to each bite of the cake.i want to add that our server and all the staff were very friendly and attentive. they always checked to make sure everything was ok for us and our glass were never empty for long.if price was holding you back from tying this wonderful establishment, consider it a steal now with a course dinner for . definitely come by and check it"
23,Brian G.,1111,4,7/28/18,tried out delmonico's for summer restaurant week and it was a very pleasant experience. started with a delicious summer soup of pureed avocado. for main course thefiletmignonwas cooked perfectly and well seasoned. the signature baked alaska for dessert was worth the calories. service was very good and dinner was tasty. the best part of going to delmonico's is the history and ambience. it is old school but not stale. i definitely recommend this nyc institution.
24,Vinny M.,1111,5,6/2/18,"wow. have not been here in about six years. all i remembered was the steak and ambience was so good. i came back here for a celebration with my girlfriend who has never been here before. just looking at the menu she was happy. let alone we were about to have steak. i love a good steakhouse like anyone but i prefer steakhouses with a history behind it and boy does this place have history. being the first yes first restaurant in the united states of america and also the first steakhouse in the country i already loved it. when i first came here i ordered thefiletmignonand it was delicious. we ordered the pan roasted scallops with figs and warm burrata. the pesto that came with the burrata was perfect and to die for so much so i asked my waiter david if there was a way i could purchase some unfortunately not for sale . but david did say next time the chef came out maybe he could tell us, which i thought was a nice gesture and did not expect the chef to come out just for pesto. i was wrong. executive chef william oliva came out just after our main course was brought out. he told us how to make the pesto and was very nice to meet. very solid gentleman. he chatted with us for a little bit and of course had to get back to running his kitchen. but i was amazed i got to meet him. so this time we ordered the day dry aged porterhouse which comes with the cuts offiletand sirloin. the dry aging made this steak that much more enjoyable. from cutting into the juicy tender meat i just had to barely press my knife into before the piece cut. such a satisfying feeling. i must add i order my steak medium rare and the amount of flavor was amazing. to the waitstaff and david our waiter and him having the executive chef come to our table for a pesto recipe. this experience takes the cake of any other steakhouse i've been too. i am definitely coming back here more often and highly recommend"
25,Eric O.,1111,5,5/9/18,"while in new york we wanted to go to one classic steakhouse and after plenty of research we decided on delminicos.we absolutely loved the rich history here and it is iconic looks were something special.we had thefiletmignonand the black sea bass with a side of crab mac n cheese, all served in a timely manner and were everything we expected, and more !our waiter, albert , was outstanding and made this experience extra special.from top to bottom delminicos is a first class operation !btw , for a classy steakhouse in new york city the prices were quite reasonable, entrees , sides and drinks apiece for under ."
26,Matt L.,1111,3,4/2/18,"restaurant week review!we chose this spot for a few reasons it was one of the places we were able to get a restaurant week reservation, it is famous iconic established in i believe , and because it was in a convenient enough location. delmonico's seems to have gone through a couple changes over the years, so i cannot say how closely it resembles that which it once was, but the theme that they go for now is oldtimey american. they specialize in american classic dishes, though they are best known for steak.since it was restaurant week, everyone's order was a flat before tax and tip. there were a couple appetizers to choose from, but some of them required price markups if you wanted to get the full version for instance, certain sizes cuts of steak had an extra associated with the cost . none of our party did this, so we mainly had to choose from three main dishes chicken a la keene, minifiletmignon, and beef short ribs. i had found out beforehand that delmonico's is allegedly where chicken a la keene was invented, so i knew before arriving what i was going to get. for my appetizer i got the lobster bisque for some reason everyone else picked the risotto , and for my dessert i ordered the cheesecake.the lobster bisque tasted a little different from what i was used to, in that it lacked it is usual savory punch that i associate with lobster bisque. if anything, it was slightly on the bitter side. my chicken a la keene was a big surprise, as i had always thought it was supposed to be a kind of, heavy white cream kind of dish. instead, there was hardly any cream sauce on my plate, and instead the chicken had been cooked with a much lighter sauce, accompanied with some vegetables. underneath i was served some pasta, which had a slightly creamer sauce mixed it, but seemed to have been prepared separately from the chicken. finally, my cheesecake was more on the creamier, liquidy side not like those concrete blocks you get at juniors and pretty enjoyable.overall, i had a good experience here, but i'm not sure i would make this a regular spot. restaurant week is supposed to be something of a discount, and i cannot picture myself paying even more money for food which was great, but a little uninspired. perhaps that comes with the territory when you are a restaurant which has been around since you stick to the classics but on my plate, it translated into something that i was not hugely excited about. still the dining space is beautiful, and i could see myself coming back here for the ambiance. the bar is especially nice, and they play sports in there, so that is another thing to check out in the future."
27,Emily G.,1111,5,3/22/18,"i work in the area and friday's after work my colleagues and i look to dine in different restaurants we stumble upon delmonico's many times but looks very pricey so some of our colleagues wallets get intimidated, well i've decided to invite a friend and return to delmonico's and i'm happy i did it is totally worth it! the ambiance in the main room it is so welcoming and food is definitely on point, service was ok but still gets stars from me, our server looked distracted and he kinda had a weird stare made us a little uncomfortable, but overall the food was very tasty i had thefiletmignonthe perfect mr i ever had and my friend had the cut steak and the wine selection was on point. i will definitely will be returning here. definitely recommend"
28,Kenji A.,1111,5,2/13/18,"honestly, our best meal in ny. we took advantage of the restaurant week dinner menu, and it was so worth it. we did not know much about the restaurant, the d ] c cor made me go and research as we waited for our meal. the history that surrounds the place, you can feel it i almost wish there was a little history book i could have flipped through at the table. our server and the bussers were fantastic my water glass was never empty and i drink water like a camel.filetmignonand the potatoes that accompanied it was perfect not too rich and the steak had the right searing on it. the cheesecake at the end was the right size and taste was bar none to any cheesecake i had in ny. price point was just about the same as any restaurant for a steak dinner . going during restaurant week just made it that much more of a value. we definitely intend to go back the next time we are in ny."
29,Fetra S.,1111,5,2/7/18,"took my girlfriend here on for her th birthday. this place is amazing, from the reservation process to everything else. i had no trouble making my reservation as it was a very easy process. this was not my first choice but i'm glad i cancelled the other reservation and chose delmonico's. the ambiance of the restaurant was perfect. we had a great dinner and my lady was so happy. our waiter albert was so efficient and nice from the get go. he made us aware of the specials for the night and as well as the restaurant week menu. he also answered all of our inquiries regarding the menu which helped us make the best dinner choices. our glasses of water were refilled every minutes by the bus boys so kudos to them as well. overall, it was an amazing night and i look forward to coming back again.ps they have the biggestfiletmignonthat i've ever seen."
30,Harvey R.,1111,5,1/28/18,great course meal for restaurant week. seafood risotto was bangin. petitefiletmignonwas tender and actually decently sized. it came on a bomb potato and cauliflower medley. cheesecake was dank af.
31,Bobbie S.,1111,5,1/4/18,"yes there is a reason why it is highly rated and long standing! it was my first time there and i had every expectation to be greatly disappointed. not! we went for a late night dinner on a saturday.and had no problem getting a table for two. we only waited for about minutes at the most for the table. i ordered thefiletmignon. it was twice the size of any previously ordered one. it had the most perfect and amazing crust just like a steak should have! it is served ala carte and honestly you do not need sides the steak sizes are so huge! you also get a choice of toppings and sauces, but i'm a purist. the bread served while you wait was nice and crusty and warm yummy! we both ordered a drink i had the fearless french and my husband had their signature drink. very strong and delicious! we ordered a simple bottle of red wine and were so full we did not finish the sides creamed spinach and asparagus we did not even get to dessert! a perfect reason to go back which we will.and an excellent deal at considering the level of service, the atmosphere, decor and quality of food. this place definitely set the standard on what steak should taste like! and an additional bonus, fancy attire is not required you will not be forced to wear a coat and tie for entrance. loved it and will make it a point to go back here each and every time i go to nyc!"
32,Veronica R.,1111,5,10/31/17,"extremely pleased with our dinner!!! been dying to try this place and i must say that this is my new favorite steakhouse ! my fianc ] c had the day aged ribeye and i had the gold reservefiletmignon. for appetizers we had the oysters which were an amazing quality had an almost sweet aftertaste which complimented the overall flavor , and had the creamed spinach and king crab mac and cheese as our appetizers. we asked our server for a wine that suited our taste preference and were extremely delighted when he got it right on the first try ! i was so surprised at his knowledge concerning this since most of the time we settle for whatever bottle of wine servers who have no idea what they are talking about give us haha . the gold reservefiletmignonmelted in my mouth like butter and the aged ribeye really makes a huge difference in comparison to traditional ribeyes as far as the juicy and tenderness of the meat! will definitely be coming back! worth a trip to the city but bring your wallet as this venue is a bit pricey."
33,Mindy L.,1111,4,8/21/17,"i've heard of delmonico's but definitely have never even thought about trying it out because it is a bit expensive. so for an early birthday dinner, i decided to bring my boyfriend here. it was also the last day of restaurant week and i really wanted to try some place worth it for the prefix price. not stars because drink service was slow. i made reservations a week before for dinner at p.m. on friday, august th on opentable and had no problem at all. i had to change my reservation time around because my boyfriend was caught up at work so we ended up with a pm at last minute.we got there at and let the hostess up front know that we had a reservation but we are a bit early. she asked for my name, checked our umbrellas and reservation in, and was seated within minutes. we got one of the three person tables on the main dining area all the way in the back booth slot and it was not too crowded.as soon as we sat, a nice older waiter handed us menus and had our iced water filled. we both went with the restaurant week menu and my boyfriend ordered the delmonico no. cocktail. these cocktails were strong but my boyfriend loved it because it was exactly what he needed after a long week of work.for appetizers i got the lobster newberg for a supplement and he got the baby iceberg wedge salad. these came really quickly which surprised us because it was literally only within a couple of minutes of putting in our order with our waiter. my newberg was good and lobster was just exactly cooked. i usually like my lobster tail with a little bit of bite to it but it was a little more soft tender mushy than i would like, which made me kept thinking if it was raw or a bad lobster. also, i generally just do not eat raw food so i was not into that texture at all. my boyfriend's salad was good but he said there was a lot of blue cheese. maybe a little too much for his liking. my portion was good, there were some sliced veggies, claws and one small lobster tail that is halved and his salad was a good appetizer size.for entrees i got the petitefiletmignon only available during dinner and he got the delmonico classic steak supplement and these were perfect. i asked for medium and he got medium rare, both were cooked to perfection. i was always skeptical about restaurant week menu items because although there is a supplement, i feel like i've read a lot of reviews where they say they skimp out on the portions but this was definitely not the case. my petitefiletmignonwas indeed petite, i wish there was a bit more but i finished everything on my plate, including the roasted fingerling potatoes and broccoli. his steak was definitely worth it. it was a good size steak, definitely an inch thick and even my boyfriend who usually eats a good amount of steak, said he was full from it.for dessert, i got the classic baked alaska supplement and he got the new york cheesecake. i noted in our reservation online, that we were coming to celebrate his birthday and the not once did i mention it in person at the restaurant but the waiter lit a candle and had it in his cheesecake when it came out! he made a wish and it was extra special for him! the cheesecake was very soft and moussey, it was good but a bit warm we wish it was actually cold. my baked alaska was delicious and a lot to eat! i could not finish it but the toasted marshmallow fluff and ice cream inside was delicious. not a fan of the sour tart syrup sauce they had around the plate because it was very sour haha.overall, it was a great experience, especially with the restaurant week menu, which is why i chose to come. the only thing that makes it one less star was the drink service was slow. my boyfriend got a total of of their delmonico no. but those took sometime to get to us. it was not until halfway into our entrees did the first drink finally come. the waitress was nice and did stop by after we ate our appetizer to let us know the drink was coming, which it was not for another mins.other than that, portions were good see pictures and the experience was nice. the prefix menu plus the drinks came out to a total of about with tax and with a % tip, it was just over . i tipped % because i actually really enjoyed their service, i've head bad stories with portion and attitude problems at other places when ordering from the rw menu, and it was definitely not an issue here.this meal was a bit expensive and not something we do on a weekly basis, but definitely nice for a special event for during restaurant week."
34,Shirley Y.,1111,5,8/20/17,went alone for lunch on friday. ordered mishima reserve gold labelfiletmignonwith asparagus and carrot sides. expensive but worth the money! enjoyed every bite!the waiter had good manner. i felt comfortable even i dined in alone. the restaurant was packed with people and it is a little crowed and noisy.
35,JoDe R.,1111,5,8/19/17,wonderful food & service!!lobster omggggg amazing!!!filetmignonsuperb!great evening!
36,Brian G.,1111,5,8/7/17,"it is as good as it gets when it comes to classy and a throw back to a bygone era. i had the the delmonico double cheese burger with french fries and the course restaurant week meal. we went to the bar and grill side, it was a last minute thought this past friday night, . the burger was a home run, cooked the way they chose which is rare, and it was stacked with cheddar, onion, ranhoffer sauce and love!! big and beautiful as a burger goes.they probably had the same meat purveyors since they had opened! the rest. week portion for the better half was a lobster newberg, a bit salty but still really good, followed by a petitefiletmignon, and the dessert which made them even more famous was their baked alaska. you cannot get a baked alaska as good as you can at delmonico's.that is a fact if you want to try one, this is the place to do it.it is the true classic of american steakhouses from a gilded era and still is the best, with a very attentive and knowledgable staff. % recommend it and if anyone is inviting me, i would always say a big yes!!!"
37,Arlene L.,1111,4,8/6/17,"my son & i have been doing nyc restaurant week summer & winter for the last couple of years. we always have a great time. this year we chose delmonico's.we were early for our pm reservation, but they were willing to seat us right away. however, the hostess led us down to the basement! when i asked why we were not being seated in the main dining room, she told me there were no tables available. i insisted that we wanted to be upstairs & said we would wait. back at the front desk, she told us to have a seat, it would be a while. she was back before we even sat down & led us the first table in the dining room, just inside of the reception area. my son, who is years old, did not think it a big deal to be relegated to the basement but did note that the restaurant was basically empty. it really bothered me, being treated like we were unworthy!the food my son ordered the naked ravioli, petitefiletmignon& a glass of wine. he loved the ravioli & enjoyed thefilet. he cleaned his plate, literally, with a piece of bread dipped in butter. i chose the burrata salad & delmonico steak + . my salad was good, though i thought it was a bit skimpy & not something i could not have pulled off myself. the delmonico steak. it was a very generous size & oh my, it was soooo good! even with the boy's assistance, i took half of it home. dessert my son got the cheesecake, rather small & just ok. the baked alaska + was lovely although they did not flamb ] c it & delicious.also, the waiter took a beautiful photo of the two of us. other than the poor welcome, we had a lovely evening."
38,Juliana T.,1111,4,8/6/17,"we came here for summer restaurant week , and it definitely did not disappoint. first off, the ambiance of this place is old world classic. the hostesses look very out of place in their bellybaring tops and miniskirts, but the waitstaff look clean and professional in white dress shirts and black vests.we were seated in the lower level, which was less opulent than the first floor dining room, but still beautiful and in keeping with the overall decor and theme of the restaurant.service was really great except one waiter who was a little curt, but nothing glaring. our main waiter was very friendly and professional.the rw menu is a bit limited, but there are options to upgrade to better dishes at a supplement charge. for starters, we had the naked ravioli stars tiny pieces of ravioli with an average ricotta filling but yummy mushroom sauce and lobster newberg supplement, starssuper tender young lobster tail and claws in a todiefor creamy sauce, but there was no caviar as listed on the menu . entrees were the petitfiletmignon starstender, wellseasoned, and also came with a delicious steak sauce and the classic steak supplement, starsalso very tender and wellseasoned . and finally, our desserts were the baked alaska supplement, starsthe toasted merengue was nice, but the banana ice cream was too frozen and crystallized and the chocolate mousse cake starsfluffy and very chocolatey . we also had a bottle of their special rw red wine , which was great with all the red meat.overall, great experience, great food!"
39,Dave K.,1111,5,6/25/18,"i have been to delmonico's a few times and most recently in early june. i have had an amazing experience, each time. i think it is the beststeakhouse in the usa, and clearly the best in nyc, forget that place in williamsburg that cuts yoursteakfor you .i usually start with a dirty martini, and cesar salad. i always get thedelmonicosteak.beststeakin nyc, juicy, flavorful, and you can cut it with a butter knife. my most recent visit, my wife ordered the donuts for desert.it was amazing. anyone visiting nyc, should really visit delmonico's."
40,Ji T.,1111,5,1/28/18,"if you are in town and want to try out thedelmonicosteakor many other dishes that were famously originally created from the oldest restaurant in america, you must rsvp via opentable at least a day ahead. there is also a bar section and its own entrance. thedelmonicosteakitself does not come with any sides, i highly recommend my creamed spinach because you want to morally feel healthy when you are chowing down on a thick slab of cow."
41,Rie Z.,1111,5,1/20/18,"hard to have anything but praise when food comes out perfect. there is only one reason this restaurant is still great. they care, about the customers experience and their food. we had one lobster, one filet and onedelmonicosteak. everyone one was happy i will say do not skip billy bacon it is amazing. we also ordered bacon fried rice anddelmonicopotatoes. i found the brussels sprout with some peppers were wonderful. i usually do not talk about dessert but i was excited to try the real baked alaska. i can only say wow not what i actually thought it was but it was wonderful. it was was walnuts cake with ice cream and tons of yummy torched meringue. the profiteroles were also amazing ! the only thing we felt was meh was the apple tart. the staff was also excellent not the stubbed greeting last big islandsteakhouses are know for either. this staff was anxious to make your appointment and experience flawless."
42,Marissa V.,1111,5,12/8/17,"we came to this restaurant to celebrate my parents' th anniversary. my brother arrived early to surprise my parents, and the hostesses and wait staff completely played along they allowed him to play a waiter, serving my parents water until they recognized him! i cannot thank this restaurant enough for going the extra mile to make my parents' th anniversary dinner and surprise visit by my brother a success. so i give delmonico's service five stars out of five!as for the food, it was fantastic! my brother and i believe it was the beststeakswe ever had we had thedelmonicosteaks. the wine selection is extensive, and the wait staff is quite knowledgeable and obliging in providing selections. so pleased with our visit . i will be back the next time i'm in nyc!"
43,Eric R.,1111,5,12/2/17,"from the outside it does not look like much and with lots of hype being one of the oldeststeakhouses in america. so i came into this place with big eyes and an empty stomach.do not forget to come in with a full wallet too as the food is a bit pricey but i think its worth the price for a special occasion. the crab cake i had was amazing, with big juicy pieces of crab and being held together just barely enough so all the other ingredients do not over power the crab. the ny strip anddelmonicosteakswere cooked perfectly and had a rich deep flavor of wonderfully dry aged beef.take your time and enjoy every single bite, i know i did! stars."
44,Daisy M.,1111,4,11/26/17,"not sure where to start with this place. i have only been times in my lifetime & i have to say i have never been disappointed with the food and service. the place is pretty hoity toity upscale with that being said i did not find it very memorable or enjoyable more of a monotone vibe . i usually have the the signaturedelmonicosteakwhich is always amazing and should be for the price , but if you prefer a leanersteakwith less fat, then this is definitely not thesteakfor you.i recommend this place for a special dinner celebration as the food is excellent, but i do not feel it is a place to frequent for a couple of reasons st i do not think the menu ever changes, nd prices are not reasonable the tab has always been over for peoplehence why i've only gone once a year over the past years and lastly. not very memorable, the environment felt a little up tight. the staff were very attentive, without much personality i guess this is the tone all around .bottom line, delmonico's is truly an iconic & historic fixture of nyc so as a new yorker you must try it at least once. based on the food quality, i rate this place . stars. if i had to rate the environment & ambiance, i would give it stars guess i'm not at that success point in life yet where everything has to be so serious & uptight . it is a true classic upscale experience, but if you are looking for the latest & greatest go elsewhere."
45,Bill G.,1111,5,8/12/17,one of my all time favorites!! i always enjoy the pan roasted halibut and thedelmonicosteak.they never disappoint.
46,Mehrnaz H.,1111,3,8/5/17,"had a reservation for pm, was seated around pm. when is asked about the reason for wait, the response was they seat about customers at the restaurant and cannot guarantee the prompt seating!! that was not what i expected of a restaurant of this caliber and long years of experience.when seated, it seemed there was a confusion on who was going to be serving us, took a while for them to serve us bread and butter to start with. we opted for the restaurant week pre fix menu. ordered the poke tuna and lobster for appetizers. both were delicious both had a surcharge on top of the pre fix . for entree we had the filet mignon anddelmonicosteak. i really preferred the taste and tenderness of the filet mignon much more than thesteak. the side of broccoli was a bit overdone for my taste.ordered the baked alaska and the chocolate mousse for dessert, really enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake. it was silky and rich. waited for another min for someone to present us the bill.i really expected better service from a place likedelmonico."
47,Tonia N.,1111,5,6/8/17,great meal and terrific service. the signaturedelmonicosteakwas exceptional. the bison special was good but a little pricy. no regrets.
48,Michelle W.,1111,3,5/11/17,"more like a . but rounded down to because of the amateur mistakes delmonico's is making.we came with a reservation late friday evening. while we were waiting for the party to arrive, we grabbed drinks at the bar, which was fun and bustling.once the rest of our party arrived, we were seated immediately. the restaurant has a very dimly lit ambience definitely very intimate and high class.everything on the menu looked great. choosing between the lobster newberg and the filet, i ended up settling for the filet, since we were at a steakhouse of course. my friends also for the filet anddelmonicosteak. we got the bearnaise sauce to share. we split three sides roasted vegetables,delmonicopotatoes, and fries. our waiter was very open and transparent with us about the portion of the sauce and sides.filet mignon this was the beststeaki've had in my life. it was extremely tender and flavorful do not let anyone tell you filet mignons are not! . one qualm i did have with it, though, was that i ordered it mediumrare and got a something definitely very rare. i read other reviews of theirsteaksbeing undercooked, so maybe overestimate how you would like yoursteakcooked the filet also came with some leafy greens, which was nice with the heavy meal we were having.delmonicosteak thissteakwas pretty disappointing. i tried a bit from of my friends, but much preferred the filet mignon. it was very fatty and sinewytotally the opposite of my butter filet. my friend actually ended up cutting away of hissteakbecause it was too gristley and fatty for him. i guess if you like that stuff you should get thedelmonicosteak, but if you like a very clean and tendersteak, get the filet.bearnaise sauce very buttery, rich, and delicious. the consistency was weird, though, in that it was not pourable and more like a spread think mayonnaise. . so i had to spread it onto mysteak.sides we got for people, but probably could have gotten one more.delmonicopotatoes were very tasty and i've had nothing like it before mini potatoes baked in a cheesy cream sauce . the roasted carrots also were very pretty as they were purple, red, and orange dessert although we were full, we had to try baked alaska, as it originated here. it was amazing. the outside meringue was super creamy, but also light. the ice cream and cake provided a nice contrast too. definitely would get one of these if you are here.service was bizarre. in the middle of our meal, our waiter announced that his shift was over and the sommelier would be taking our table over. not a huge problem, but just bizarre. also one of the table runners tried our baked alaska clearly before we were done. felt like we were being rushed.overall the experience felt very classy, fancy, and historic, so i was pleased with the experience, just disappointed in the amateur mistakes like undercooking thesteakand odd service. probably would not come back because there are better steakhouses at better prices, but delmonico's should be on the nyc bucket list for anyone who is excited about fine dining and historic food."
49,Julia M.,1111,5,4/19/17,"this is history. culinary history. the lobster newburg is better than i have had anywhere in boston. it is a pound lobster with just enough newburg sauce. it is not swimming in sauce, because lobster is delightful on its own, why hide the flavor it also comes with potatoes and spinach. a very filling meal. the greatest takeaway is that the lobster was cooked perfectly. even in boston, i find it overcooked way too often, and it is tough.steak! i feel fortunate enough to have dined with people who share their food. our table got the signaturedelmonicosteak, and the day dry ageddelmonicosteak. so we all got to realize perfection in tasting dry aged vs wet aged. they were both excellent. the wet aged is juicier, but my choice will always be the dry aged. i felt it had more meatiness and they do a perfect char around the entiresteakthat i have never seen. not burnt, but a flavorful char. once you get towards the bone, it is like beef bacon!!but, if you are on a date or a business meal, get the regulardelmonicosteak. it will be great, boneless, and you will not have the urge to get all fred flintstone and pick up the bone and gnaw on it for all the deliciousness that it has to offer.oh, and how can i forget for appetizers, we got the cheek and bone and then we passed around the rather perfect eggs benedict. i keep using the word perfect here, but that is what these dishes were. the eggs benedict were perfect with orange roe on top. the sauce, the egg yolks, the smoked meat, it was everything i needed it to be! the cheek and bone was in itself a moment to remember. i cannot begin to tell you how much flavor was in the bone marrow and crispy bits. and how tender and tasty the cheek meat was. i always contend that facial meat is the most underutilized meat on any animal. so good!the baked alaska is devine. i understand the gelato in the baked alaska is made on the premises. we also had the blueberry pie ] la mode. more of a tart with a struesel topping, but well accomplished. the winner on the dessert menu by far, hands down is the cr ] are me brul ] c e. i am normally quite tired of cr ] are me brul ] c e on every menu, however, this is not like any cr ] are me brul ] c e i have ever had or made. it is closer to a panna cotta with the carmelized sugar on top. so creamy, so smooth, and it is served out of the dish. again, reminds me of panna cotta, but much better with a couple other components to the dessert.this place is old school. if you are looking for the latest greatest food technology that will wow you, go somewhere else. if you want classic dishes done perfectly that will wow you, then come here."
50,Mo K.,1111,5,4/12/17,"excellent customer service! a couple of friends and i went in on a friday night and it was a bit packed but were able to get a table without a reservation. it was in the middle of everything which at first made me a bit uncomfortable.we started off with getting west coast oysters and tuna tartar. the oysters i'm a bit neutral with as they are not something i eat often, but they were good. i have no complaints about it. the tartar was absolutely amazing. we also ordered thedelmonicosteakand the day draged bone in rib eye all this food was split amongst three people cooked the way the chef prefers it. overall the food was delicious and it is something we all enjoyed.what absolutely made this is an excellent experience was the staff and great care they took with us. they were very aware of what was needed and what needed to be brought out at the right time. they were not overbearing but happened to serve us at the right times. it was fairly packed but that caused no issues or delays in service. we got a brief history lesson and some minutiae details about delmonico's.we ended our night with the baked alaska. they used a lighter torch to bake the meringue in front of us which looked very nice but left an odd taste on the browned meringue. overall an amazing experience."
51,Peter G.,1111,5,3/6/17,"you are in for a treat as soon as you walk into this wood dominated historical carnivorium. this restaurant invented so many culinary staples and was the first at so many aspects such as the use of tablecloths and offering reservations you owe it to yourself as a new yorker to enjoy it at least once. appetizers, spearheaded by billy's housecured bacon, the most delicious bacon i've ever had, was thrilling. indeed the king crab mac and cheese was packed with flavor. thedelmonicosteak, namesake potatoes, and roasted cauliflower were a winning trifecta. a shade disappointed with the baked alaska. neighboring bar is happy and loud. bartenders have a good hand and imagination. waiters were attentive, knowledgeable, and informative. a first class dining experience."
52,June S.,1111,4,2/9/17,"this is a review of restaurant week dinner.when you think of real, classic restaurant of all time in the us, delmonico's should come to your thoughts. it is the first fine dining restaurant in the country, opened in . this is where thedelmonicosteak, eggs benedict, balked alaska, chicken a la keene, and lobster newburg were created. yes, they are the original of all originals!the main dining room was much larger than i expected, with antique style chandeliers, classic wall papers that extended from the front foyer, and large paining on the back wall. the painting depicted welldressed patrons at a fancy restaurant,i assume it was a painting of delcmonico's it is the perfect painting to be in this room, it sort of creates a window into how this dining room used to look like, once upon a time. this room had nice lively energy, a bit noisy but matching the hustle of bustle of the city.through the bar next to the main dining room was another dining room, smaller, more private and quiet. this is a much better setting for business dinner, date, or anyone who wants to have a little less noise. this dining room was a bit more dimmed with softer lights and candles at each table.out of the restaurant week menu, we had buffalo mozzarella & yellow beefsteak tomato, lobster bisque, short ribs, petit filet mignon, baked alaska extra supplement , and dark chocolate mousse cake. thesteakwas really great, melt in my mouth great. everything else were really tasty as well, no complaints at all.our waitress, marina was very nice, courteous and polite. she was very friendly only if the customers wanted her to be, and quiet when the customers wanted to dine in silence. either way she always kept a smile on her face, and very efficient and professional with her work. we were well taken care of by marina and by other staffs. our water was always filled, dirty dishes taken away quickly, and dishes brought out at perfect timing. we really enjoyed our dinner here at delmonico's!"
53,Toddy P.,1111,3,2/6/17,"it is quite disappointing because i first came here for restaurant week a few years ago, and i've been a huge fan since. the buffalo mozzarella and yellow beefsteak tomato was delicious. but how wrong can you go there thesteak.sigh. the previous times i've come here, the signaturedelmonicosteakwas like buttah! thesteakscould easily have been cut with a butter knife. mysteakwas filled with gristle, chewy, and difficult to cut. and it was midrare.well it was supposed to be. it was closer to medium. i ordered the signature baked alaska for the first time. i find it cloyingly sweet like queens white cake frosting instead of br ]al ] c ed merengue.the service, as usual, is impeccable. truly wonderful service. i wished this trip was as great as the others."
54,Ali M.,1111,1,1/28/18,"too bad i missed the review about the roaches before i went or i would not have the opportunity to write this review today.i am not certain how this place has so many awesome reviews based upon my most recent experience. it is very well possible that i personally expect a higher degree towards excellence if i am dining at an establishment well known over the years for top quality food service delivery. i was disappointed with my first and last visit to this restaurant. my main gripe with this place is the temperature of the food. if i orderbraisedshortribsi expect the dish to come with a temperature rivaling hot or at least close to just coming out of the oven . unfortunately, it was not and neither were the rest of the dishes presented to our table of four. after a thoroughly disappointing meal for all of us we decided to order the absolute worst dessert in the history of desserts not to die for.the baked alaska. wow! was it gross. the banana flavored cake with gritty hard frozen vanilla ice cream and the scorched fluff exterior made for a dessert not worth tasting. power to all of the people that dine here for the status because that must be the only reason to frequent a dungeon like this. shame on you delmonico for ripping people off over years. everyone should do themselves a favor and if you go to the restaurant and do not like the food make sure to let the server know. it is apparent that no one in the kitchen either cares or is aware of the atrocities leaving the cooktop. thumbs down all around!meals all of them are over priced but these are the main dishes we haddelmonico signature steaknot warm but tender. had better elsewheredelmonico potatoesworth a try, but who comes to a steakhouse only for potatoes lamb chopsthis is better at texas de brazil at any location you can find and it is endless when you go there. can someone from delmonico's go taste this item at a restaurant that knows how this should be done braisedshortribi had better during a demonstrative speech in college when someone brought to class in a bucket. not a good dish at delmonico's by any means. i have been to a number of fine dining establishments and this one is my top worst on the list so far "
55,Amelia R.,1111,4,2/27/17,"just a commoner who ate here during restaurant week _ got beet risotto for appetizer. it was delishhh! you can taste so many flavors dancing in your mouth! then i hadbraisedshortribs, which was huge esp. after appetizer , but mashed potato was on point lastly i had chocolate mousse, which was a perfect closure since they got the portion and the richness of the chocolate just right.overall, i looove the food, the interior, the ambience and the service. giving stars bcos my friend's lobster bisque was almost like soupy rather than creamy , only had few lobsters and taste a bit bland, it was just okay."
56,Matthias H.,1111,5,2/12/17,"i went for restaurant week and was very impressedi cannot believe i have not gone before in over five years of working nearby. i would have thought that a place with this much history would coast along on its reputation, but the food is truly excellent. the salads were fresh and delicious, and thebraisedshortribswere tender, juicy and very delicious. desserts were good but not amazing but i will say that the berries were some of the most flavorful i've tasted during the winter . the staff were all helpful and the dining room is beautifultake some time to admire the paintings. i will be sure to return!"
57,Andera B.,1111,2,2/8/17,"went to delmonico's for restaurant week last night with my husband. the environment, atmosphere, & service were all great. being the oldest restaurant in america, the location is well maintained and retains an air of old school charm. the staff are all incredibly efficient and friendly.but the food was not great.appetizers roasted beet risotto & lobster bisque. both dishes were lukewarm. the bisque was more watery that creamy and there was a flavor we could not place.until my husband bit into half of a spear of clove. the risotto was good, but i wish it had arrived at the table at a hotter temperature.entrees petit filet mignon & hourbraisedshortribs. the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and had a good flavor. theshortribsalso had good flavor but the accompanying grits were too grainy for my liking.dessert cheesecake & chocolate mousse. the cheesecake had a lime flavored sauce which i did not care for. the chocolate mousse had a base of something crunchy which after some examination looked suspiciously like cocoa krispies cereal.overall, it was a great experience but delmonico's would not be my first choice steakhouse to return to."
58,Diana L.,1111,3,2/7/16,i was there for restaurant week. the food was good. i was really expecting the food to be better but it was good not great. we had a rock shrimp russia and lentil soup for appetizers. they were okay. for dinner we had the delmonicos steak andbraisedshortribs. the steak was very good and thebraisedshortribswere so soft. very good. i was just disappointed with the appetizers but the main course was great!
59,Tiffany H.,1111,4,2/15/11,"came here for restaurant week with my roommate. we have a friend who works there so we visited him during the lunch hour and had the most fantastic time.my roommate had. the delmonico salad candied walnuts, beets, argula, other stuff. it was on okay salad. she seemed to enjoy it. mushroom risotto she said it was the best she ever had. i had a taste and it was so rich and creamy and delicious it was a really good risotto. baked alaska supp. delmonico claims to have invented this dessert so it was fitting that one of us get. having only had cruise ship baked alaska experiences before today, this was a great surprise. the meringue on the outside was so thick and luscious. the banana ice cream with the cake biscuit at the bottom with creme anglais and apriot sauce. it was honestly such a unique and tasty dessert.i had. seafood chowder it was a tomato based soup with little bits of seafood in it. it was pretty good and had a good base but i would not have considered it a chowder. delmonico steak supp. all the posts had said that this steak was really good and basically a must have at this restaurant even better that the fillet mignon in a lot of reviews . it was good but not great in my opinion but i am not a big meat eater and the sheer size of the steak as it came out of the kitchen oz. i almost died. i would have been much happier with thebraisedshortribsthat was less meat and did not need a large supp. but that was my mistake and i should have known that i would not have properly enjoyed a steak. i felt like i was getting a jaw workout chewing it. left about oz of it on my plate when they took it away. steaks are a man's food and i just cannot keep up. chocolate hazelnut cake the cake had good dark chocolate flavors and the passion fruit sauce around the plate as a good compliment but by far my favorite thing about this dessert and i do not like desserts normally was the texture it had. the slight crunch from the hazelnuts made this cake for me.though there were little things about the menu that i was not completely happy with, everything had great flavor and it was all delicious. plus, we got to meet everyone there through our friend and chatting with the entire staff, including chef william, of this historic restaurant made our experience irreplaceable."
60,Edward D.,1111,5,8/28/18,"great place to eat downtown ny. this restaurant has been around in one incarnation or another since . steak delmonico & lobster newberg were invented here & while disputed, so wereeggsbenedictand baked alaska. the restaurant is beautiful and the service is excellent. it is not an everyday meal, but well worth it for a special lunch or dinner."
61,Chris A.,1111,4,1/29/17,"every year around the holidays, a good friend of mine and business associate have made it a habit of celebrating the end of another year.in the black.capitalism rules, etc etc.it is always about good steak and good drinks. this time it was time to try the original delmonico's at the southern tip on manhattan. i say original because they also have a newer delmonico's kitchen midtown near msg. so we grabbed our red cups of scotch and jumped in an uber.first off, i will never give a steak house stars. my reasoning is that although you may have an amazing meal.it is still a beef focused menu. the kitchen's creativity is going to be clipped about how far they can go as opposed to cafe matisse in rutherford nj or a viaggio in wayne nj .i mean how many freakin times do i have to see creamed spinach, garlic mash, frizzled onions on menu ! .honestly, if you practice a bit with your grill or oven, and use a good piece of aged meat from a good butcher or market, i'm sure you too can make a slab of heaven on a plate.that being said, i give del's stars for it is excellent food, excellent service and atmosphere, and it is contribution to the restaurant world. and i love the history of this place! delmonico's is the first food establishment to actually be called a restaurant .first to use table clothes.almost every you.s. president since abe lincoln ! has eaten here.it is chefs have created the infamous delmonico steak a certain aged cut of ribeye you see all over. they have createdeggsbenedict, lobster newburg, chicken a la keene and the dessert baked alaska more on that later of course it has a great selection of spirits and over , bottles of good wine.the food started off with the cheek & bone which is snake river farm beef cheek, crispy bone marrow, butternut squash. absolutely delicious. bone marrow is an old european peasant dish as i like to call it. huge flavor albeit a high fat content. this was good, although not a lot of marrow in the bone. the beef cheek was great.dayboat sea scallops with cauliflower, beets, frog hollow farm pears was prepared as good as scallops can get. the pears add a nice light sweetness that i've never really had with this bivalve.entrees were the delmonico steak when in rome. topped with foie gras oof and bully for me and a day dry aged tbone steak oscar oscar style being topped with a tarragon hollandaise sauce and asparagus. yeah, we skipped lunch that day.lol the steaks were excellent as is expected in an institution like this and about others in nyc so what more can i say other than it is what it is .only waste of time was the crispy alebattered onion rings with buttermilk blue cheese dressing.which reminded a lot like store bought y'know perfectly round & breadcrumby . the dressing was flat and had little flavor. and at for approx onion rings.forget it !!of course we had to push it and get dessert. i've always heard of baked alaska, but never tried it because i am not too fond of meringue. a dessert created in in celebration of the purchase of alaska from russia is not being a foodie educational! their version of this dish is made of banana ice cream placed in a pie dish lined with slices of sponge cake,with a thin layer of apricot compote and topped with meringue. the entire dessert is then placed in an extremely hot oven for a brief time, long enough to firm and caramelize the meringue. the meringue is an effective thermal insulator, and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream and melting it. it is a blend of warm and cold with such various, delicious flavors. one of my most favorite desserts of all time. but be warned, most restaurants that make this dish change it around a bit.all in all a great meal. delmonico's delivers what is expected. treat yourself on a special occasion. places like this are institutions, not just restaurants."

63,Elton W.,1111,4,5/23/16,"delmonico's is one of the few places in the financial district that is close to stars, primarily because of it is rich history.i mean, any restaurant that is been around since and was a favorite of abraham lincoln, theodore roosevelt, jp morgan, charles dickens, napoleon iii and mark twain, has to be on that list.i give delmonico's only stars as the food is not up to star quality, in my opinion. i would not come here just based on the food, as i think it is good, but not necessarily great. but the history definitely is great. here's my breakdown history . starsambiance . starsfood . starswine . starsprice . starsso, the question you are probably asking, is, why would elton be recommending this place so highly if the food is just ok well, here are a few facts about delmonico's that makes it more unique than any other restaurant in the united states, and a reason why i think it deserves at least one visit.delmonico's is the first & oldest fine dining restaurant in the you.s., since first to use the french word restaurant to describe itself first restaurant to use a printed menu first restaurant to use tablecloths & silverware restaurant with the largest wine cellar in the you.s. at that timein addition, delmonico's created invented these dishes, which are still popular almost years later eggsbenedict manhattan clam chowder delmonico's steak delmonico potatoes lobster newburg chicken a la king baked alaskaif you have not had any of these dishes, i highly recommend you try them as they are all good, in my opinion. and if you get a chance to try them at delmonico's, even better. although, to be honest, other places have perfected these dishes, so i'm not saying delmonico's is the best version, but it is the original.lastly, if you are a foodie and looking to be blown away by amazing cuisine, then this is not the place for that and i can assure you that you will be disappointed. yes, there are better steaks in the city, yes, there are bettereggsbenedict, chowder, etc. at other places, and yes, the ambiance is really old school and frankly, old. but, there is no denying that delmonico's is what started the restaurant industry here in the united stats, and for that, i think it is worth a visit."
64,Zack F.,1111,4,4/27/16,"a place that is so rich in history with decades of experiment behind them can only be an expertise when it comes to a steak. like the name implies, the delminco steak was invented by the restaurant along with baked alaska,eggsbenedict, and several other things. not enough history for you how about being the first fine dining estaishment in the country not enough maybe the inventor of a la carte in america. thanks to this restaurant it is your choice what to get on your dish wheeler you go. the decor was quite lovely a little old and could maybe use a little touch up but then again this place has been around for decades so maybe keeping that old charm would be best for again place as important as this. it is a legend amongst steakhouses. the outside decor is just stunning. beautiful and luxurious with the two front pillars sitting outside the building directly imported from the buried city of pompeii itself. dress professional for this spot. the filet mignon ordered was just juicy and tender quite stunning. one of the best filet mignon i have ever tasted. and the delmonico steak they are the creators so what do you think stunning. amazing such flavor and tenderness with every bite. truly the best delmonico steak you will ever have ! amazing. the mashed potatoes were also creamy and rich one of the best. over all this place is a legend amongst fine dining and steakhouses and is a definite check out. stick with what a steakhouse does best, steak, and you will be handsomely rewarded. truly an amazing steakhouse. your mouth will melt with every bite.the interior decor is quite aged but then again does it need to be modernized a place with such hisyory, probably not.friendly staff by the way, our waiter was always attentive to us and made us feel comfortable."
65,Maria D.,1111,3,3/31/16,"is this the best probably not. i would really look to brooklyn st. anselm and peter luger or queens m. wells for a better steakhouse. is this an experience absolutely. the place is steeped in history, being the first fine dining establishment in the states, and has invented many dishes, includingeggsbenedict, lobster newberg, and the baked alaska.came here for the boyfriend's birthday. just dinner for two. i ordered a martini and was sad to discover that there was no plymouth gin. bummer, but not the end of the world. the bf had a glass of a lovely bordeaux.for appetizers, we ordered the scallops and lobster newberg. both were phenomenal and i would highly recommend these dishes. the scallops were fresh and sweet, and the lobster was rich and buttery.the bf got a delmonico streak, while i ordered the chicken. i would normally make fun of someone like myself ordering poultry in a place known for steak. but, alas, i almost never eat red meat anymore. the chicken dish was described as containing chanterelles. when it arrived, the bird was topped with cremini aka button mushroom aka the common mushroom. the cheapest most boring mushroom. the cremini did not work with the roasted onionsapple soubise sauce that the chicken was resting on. the flavor of the apple would have worked with chanterelles, but cremini awful. thankfully, i was full from the appetizers and was saving room for the baked alaska.the bf loved his steak. we also ordered the mashed potatoes and a special side of broccoli rabe. both were nice. i tried a little tiny bite of the steak and enjoyed it.the baked alaska was great. they brought it out with a solitary candle and thankfully did not sing birthday songs. the meringue is incredible and i would gladly eat it every day of my life. the banana sorbet was an unexpected but nice touch.service was attentive and apt, apart from failing to notify me that there will be no chanterelles in my chicken dish.overall, i'm not going to seek out another visit, but if somebody brings me there for a celebration or a work dinner, i would be okay with that."
66,Cindy M.,1111,5,6/13/14,"we frequent steak houses in and around the city, and many are very good to excellent. our current favorite is delmonico's in the financial district at beaver street. delmonico's is an old fashioned ny steakhouse with the atmosphere you would expect and the history that makes it a true ny landmark.they claim that demonico's was the first fine dining establishment in nyc and was diamond jim brady's favorite restaurant, they also claim to have invented delmonico steak,eggsbenedict, lobster newburg, and baked alaska. i can tell you, that whether they were invented here or not, their lobster newberg and baked alaska are probably the best i've ever had. their steaks are done to perfection and among the best in nyc. the delmonico steak and filet mignon are our favorites. the delmonico potatoes are not to be missed either. the service at delminico's is perfect, the waiters seem to appear table side exactly when you need them. the price point is on par with other good ny steakhouses. reservation are a must during dinner hours and weekdays are crowded with wall street workers."
67,Jason F.,1111,4,5/23/13,"went here for a birthday last month and i really liked this place. they are the restaurant that created a ton of iconic dishes, some of which are not on the menu for example theeggsbenedictwas on the menu in the bar pub area but not in the main dining room, but they say they welcome offmenu orders like that. i also liked that they did not rush us ever and were very polite. if you are a history buff, you need to get down to delmonico's."
68,Rhonda W.,1111,4,1/6/13,"so, i do not want to place this review under delmonico's bar and grill the side entrance because i do not want this review to get missed but. did you know the side entrance existed and, apparently delmonico's is whereeggsbenedictwas invented! yeah, that is right and i ordered it, loved it, ate every last bite, and will probably come back for more as a cheat meal breakfast . they are not messing around with theeggsbenedict thick slabs of ham, creamy tangy hollandaise sauce and a nice thick round toasted bit to soak up the yumminess.the coffee here was also great, served fresh at the table and plenty of refills if you find your cup empty.i'm proud to have made this review my th one, and i hope you come to endulge in the history ofeggshere everyday between noon and pm !"
69,Jennifer L.,1111,5,7/25/12,"i am a big fan of delmonico's! we order take out frequently when working late and love their rib eye steak, but today we were able take a nice break and dined for their restaurant week lunch. the menu was great. we all had the watermellon gazpacho, which had ceviche tasting shrimp in it! the sirloin steak was amazing!!! sliced and perfectly medium rare with a wine reduction sauce over this delicious cream of potatoes. i want more of it! now! the dessert was great too. i had the lemon cheesecake, which was smooth and light tasted like key lime pie! we also tried their baked alaska, which is one of their many signature dishes which they are famous for creating. home of the firsteggsbenedict ! oh and apparently the term  would was first created by their chef in , where the delmonico's steak was item number on the menu and he would tell the staff they were out of the steak for the day! take a break and dine here, amongst all it is history! dine like the best of them! from abraham lincoln to jp morgan to mark twain to teddy roosevelt to napoleon!"
70,Ann L.,1111,4,12/29/10,"for some reason, restaurant week turned into restaurant month this year. no complaints here, though.came here for a friend's birthday due to the extension of rw. the minute i stepped inside, i could tell this was a high class place. apparently it also has its share of history too, as it was the birthplace of baked alaska paging sarah palin andeggsbenedict. what the what how awesome is that my tastings from the rw menu grilled asparagus and frizee salad with tangerine and grapefruit and poachedegg fresh and light, summery. i'm not usually a big fan of frizee since it is usually too bitter, but the bitterness was balanced well by the sweetness of the tangerine and surprisingly, the grapefruit i'm also not a grapefruit fan by any means .filet mignon tender, moist, and lying on a delicious bed of creamy potatoes. the vegetable accompaniment was a nice gesture to stave off the guilt of eating my month's worth of animal fat content in one sitting.chocolate peanut butter mousse every dieter's worst nightmare an irresistable combination of chocolate and peanut butter, and no rationalization for why you should be eating this in the first place except for the fact that it tastes damn good.service was excellent, even though it was clear that we were here for rw, which was considerably cheaper than what the meal would have been if we had ordered from the regular menu. three cheers for rw, the only way i can afford to eat like a wall street honcho without having to learn all that banking stuff."
71,Angela K.,1111,3,10/13/10,"a classic. real old school new york! this place has been around since . that is unheard of! the restaurant is located in the financial district in a beautiful building. although bustling by day, come night time it is pretty desolate down there. the interior is large and elegant. and has that dark wood, fine dining feel, without being completely stiff.start off with some classic cocktails. this is the type of place you order a tom collins or a manhattan. delmonico's is a classic american steak house and the originator of many popular dishes of today.eggsbenedict, baked alaska and the delmonico steak, among others. for our visit we went with the filet mignon and the delmonico cut steak both cooked perfectly. pair it with some typical steak sides like creamed spinach, hash browns and whipped potatoes and you will be so full you will not be able to stand. make sure that you leave a little room for the meringue covered baked alaska. it was worth the wait.the scene elegant, old school new york steakhousefood and drinks . pleasantly stellar! i love myself a juicy steak and some potatoes.tip worthy gratuity included. service started off a little snippy, but the waiter warmed up and became extremely helpful and friendly.coordinates city minute ride to fun. when you walk on to the street after dinner, you will be the only one there. hop a cab uptown for some action.restaurant return rate yellow light. great experience but not sure we would venture all the way downtown to eat here again.this review written by angela."
72,Matt E.,1111,4,7/19/10,"delmonico's is truly a nyc treasure and not just for it is historic value but for it is food. to date delmonio's is the nd oldest restaurant in new york st being the river cafe which opened in . in swiss immigrants, giovanni and pietro delmonico originally opened a pastry shop on william st about a block away from it is current location on beaver street. they soon started serving more than desserts and in delmonico's was officially a restaurant and by they opened their famed location on beaver street making it the city's first fine dining experience. delmonico's claims to have been the first restaurant in the country to offer a printed menu for its diners as well as the inventors of some classic dishes such as baked alaska, lobster newberg, andeggsbenedict. though the restaurant has not been operating within the delmonico family since the early 's you would not know that by anything you will experience here.having previously been to another historic nyc steakhouse peter lugar's est. and been completely underwhelmed by the food and ambiance i did not know what to think going to delmonico's. happily, i was very impressed with delmonico's. first of all i love the downtown area, the streets are smaller and have no order to them and it feels much more historic, like north boston. the restaurant is in a beautiful building in way intersection. once inside the restaurant i was even more impressed with their gorgeous interior. an interior that did not feel too old, too pretentious, too modern, too classy, or too casual. it was the perfect classy and comfortable atmosphere split between two floors and a number of rooms which kept everything from feeling too big or cavernous. the waiters, all in tuxes, did a good job of keeping the food coming and the drinks filled without feeling rushed. our waiter's personality was not the warmest by any means but he seemed like an eastern european which is a common trait in those cultures so i will not hold it against him. the prices are pretty high here but i would not exactly call them overpriced for the quality of the food and the experience is worth the splurge.as a side note they do operate a nd business with a separate entrance on the side of the building which is more of a classy bar and grill. this is where you can get their famedeggsbenedictand some more affordable dishes such as a burger or steak frites.i came here during restaurant week so i was able to get a course dinner for tax, tip, and drinks obviously not included . the meal started with a warm bread basket of very tasty seasoned rolls and butter. i order a beer which was brought to me in a bottle with a glass very similar to a wine glass. i started my meal with the scallop and corn appetizer. i was actually quite disappointed with this as i was served a single scallop that had been cut in half. i think this portion size was unacceptably low even for a nice restaurant and if i had to be served a single scallop that last thing i would want them to do to it would be to cut it in half for presentation purposes. still the dish was cooked and presented nicely. my date had gotten the lobster newberg a supplement which was their famous creation but in size portion which is actually a lobster . this was quite tasty and the sauce was very nice, my only complaint however is that the dish was described as coming with a caviar garnish something my date was eager to try for the first time and there was no caviar to be found on the dish. we both got the filet mignon for an entree and a chocolate peanut butter mouse for dessert. the filet mignon was served with mixed vegetables which consisted of carrots both the regular and the white variety as well as string beans. the vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned though i could have stood for a few more pieces . the filet was also cooked perfectly and was the best steak i have ever had. it was not fatty or overly seasoned and did not need any sauce whatsoever. though the portion was small, it was not too small by any means, i found the portion to be just right. i'm sad to say that even though i found the steak to be the best i've had my date said hers was not impressive and when i gave her a bite of mine she told me that hers was not as tender. the mouse for dessert was also pretty small but it was so rich that the small portion seems just right though i definitely would not have complained if the piece had been bigger . the mouse was smooth with the perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter flavor without either being overwhelming. overall though my service did not come with the biggest smile and the portion sizes left me a little underwhelmed, the ambiance and food was definitely something to write home about, as is the amazing history of the place. i will definitely be back next restaurant week, if not sooner."
73,Teresa B.,1111,4,4/16/10,"delmonico's is a wall street culinary institution that has been in business since . the location and history alone is worth the visit.reading the menu and website will inform you that this was the birthplace ofeggsbenedict, lobster newburg, baked alaska and chicken ala king.delmonicosny.com about, ,a i was invited to a private function and the evening was memorable. the service was stellar and the food was great. i ordered a wedge salad, steak, and a side of creamed spinach.i will definitely remember delmonico's when i want to celebrate special occasions."

75,Valerie B.,1111,5,11/22/08,"meat gooddrinks goodambiance goodprices not so good if you are not a big bank, lawyer or anyone with an expense account but if you are with said people and they are picking up the tab.then it is great!!!which is how i had the time honored chance to eat here. the filet mignon was sets of yummy and the sides that were chosen some potato dish, spinach and mushrooms were also wonderfully delightful.the added bonus is to be eating at a place with such history.opened since i think and the creator of many notable dishes like the baked alaska andeggsbenedict. with so much newness in ny it is great to eat somewhere that is been able to stick. if you get the chance and have profound love of steaks this is a must!!!"
76,Alicia B.,1112,4,11/1/18,ordered the chicken chimichangas to start which was very yummy and found the sauce to go with it was tasty as well.for the entree my husband and i had a chicken taco and chicken burrito bowl with tortilla.my husband found the tacos to be small wish they were bigger. i enjoyed my burrito bowl.the place is very comfy with dining both inside and out. there is also a bar area to have somedrinks on the go.they also have television screens throught out on the inside if you want to keep abreast of the sports! with your favourite latin music playing on the inside.would recommend here as a spot to visit.

78,Puja P.,1112,1,10/17/18,"guys, guys, guys, i have so many feelings. and i only ordered three things that should be simple enough ! also i've worked near here for years and only just went here for the first time and now i know why. . grilled mexican corn. i mean, this was fine. acceptable, maybe but it was definitely boiled before it was lightly charred to masquerade as properly grilled. the texture was not satisfying. flavor, just ok. would i have it again no thank you. i have a huge bag of cotija cheese at home and now i have the motivation to make it myself. the redeeming factor was a order includes two ears of corn. . chicken flautas. the menu states that this is made with potatoes, so that itself was not a surprise when i got around to eating it. but i've had a decent number of flautas in my day and many potatoes and you know, when you cook potatoes, you need to season them! this was bland af. here is an email i sent to my coworker to whom i had offered a flauta are bland. do you know where to find hot sauce or any flavoring agents and want one there are , which i did not realize you will need the aforementioned hot sauce or flavoring agents though. the note i wrote on a postit for her, with a tiny packet of salt taped to it i cannot in good faith call this a present but you may eat it if you wish. you will need this salt if you do. i also coopted the limes from the elotes to fix the flautas. . tres leches cake. uh, i think you should know, when strawberries are brown it means they are rotten. the cake was fine. there is granulated sugar on top is that normal "
79,Allix H.,1112,4,10/8/18,"we had come here on a friday night looking to try their margaritas. i will say, their menus are super cute. they look like passports, and the inside ceilings and walls are decorated. that was what initially drew me in as i was walking past the vicinity and i told myself i would be coming back to check it out.we had ordered a pitcher of the strawberry margarita. before that we had two drinks that were free if checked in on yelp. we showed it to the waitress and she asked to remind her at the end, but we did not remember and so we were charged the two margaritas. i mean it is not ideal to ask us to remind her when she knows we are ordering a pitcher of margaritas.we had also ordered the wings, which were good. even better after a few of those margaritas. i had also noticed the table behind me they were celebrating a birthday and were drinking a margarita tower!! i want to say these were around , and you cannot get one unless you have at least people in your party. aka i will probably need to come back again."
80,Steve A.,1112,4,10/7/18,"it does not get better for mexican in the financial district than mad dog and beans. just the chips and guacamole is a pretty good meal. of course you need a margarita to quench your thirst. it is what you expect for prices. they are not too bad though.i had the classic margarita. it is about at happy hour. that is not too bad, and it was a large one. for the food i just had the salsa trio, which was enough since i recently ate. this includes pico de gallo, roasted tomato salsa, and salsa verde. it is about , which is higher than it should be for just salsa, though it tasted much better than typical. it was fresh. this did not taste like it came from a bottle, and the roasted tomato salsa and salsa verde both were mildly spicy.it has a good fun atmosphere. it is not too crazy and people are chill. this is one of many mexican restaurants around stone street, and it may be the best of them."
81,Ameya B.,1112,3,8/31/18,"we were interviewing a candidate over lunch at this place, and were seated on the outside area where it is always packed on a summer friday. service is usually slow at most places and mad dog was not exception.i ordered the mad dog salad with chicken and my colleague ordered the grilled shrimp tostada . the salad is okay and the grilled chicken was really dry, so did not really enjoy that much.service was not that great. i was missing cuttlery and it took a long time to get one, even when i asked for it."
82,Lana L.,1112,4,7/27/18,"good spot for drinks after work! came here on a friday a couple weeks ago mostly for the margarita towers i've heard about. it was super packed, but we were able to get a table that fit everyone people once most of the group was present. it was also super loud, especially upstairs.we shared two margarita towers guava and mango. i did not think the margaritas themselves were anything special, but the super tall margarita towers that they came in made it fun. they were also pretty strong margaritas! we also had wings and a large guac and chips . the guac and chips came with a lot of tomato, so i ate around it.taste | . atmosphere | . presentation | service | . overall | .

83,Darren B.,1112,4,11/1/18,"mad dog has a good location in the financial district among the cobblestone street. the appetizer i had was the chicken chimichangas which tasted great. unfortunately they only served and it was small. entree i had was the chicken tacos which tasted really well. they served four but they are small. the restaurant has a nice environment to talk to friends not too loud, screens for looking at sports highlights. the server was friendly and food did not take long to arrive."
84,Atarah J.,1112,5,11/1/18,"tequila tequila tequila! stop here and indulge in the tequila !!!! great staff, awesome drinks, and guilty pleasure food. this is a great after work spot to kick back and relax. i would definitely recommend coming here. i usually get the tampique ]+a and share the margarita tower with friends. i am never disappointed!"
85,Angie D.,1112,4,8/4/18,"i love coming to this place. eating outside in the summer time feels great!is always a mits to mits wait time though.their spicy guac. is sooo good. it has jalape ]+os in it. their mojito, coconut and pineapple is refreshing with fresh basil, its so tasty and so good! i had three! the skirt steak was delish. also the bell peppers that come with it as well.this place is perfect for a date, or just to hang out.fyi they play music really loud, so maybe depending on the type of date will matter."
86,Pasquale R.,1112,5,5/29/18,"great food, service and location!it was a perfect spring day and were not planning on sitting outside but we scored a table for two right by the door way on the outside. score!it was lunch time so it was bustling.what to expect killer margarita's. they are served in plastic cups which makes me thing you can take them to go as long as your on stone st.maybe not.dunno.needless to say sit and eat there and order one.delicious, americanized mexican food save the burrito and order the bowl.and get a side order of chips to dip into it .yummy!ask for alej if you go there and receive great service.great people watching if sitting outside.mexican corn and sweet plantains are top in nyc, imo.nyc prices but worth it.the food is not over seasoned which seems to be the problem at most mexican spots.their guac, although not pictured, is definitely something you should order.enjoy!"
87,Mel T.,1112,4,5/3/18,"stopped in for dinner on a tuesday night with a few friends at around , and the place was not too packed. at the time, i was on a nocarb diet, but there were not really any nocarb items on the menu. i went with the burrito bowl, but told them no rice. they really took care of me because they gave me a lot of extra steak instead no extra charge , and i left feeling stuffed. plus, it was pretty good.now that i'm back on carbs who was i kidding , i would not mind trying out some of their other menu items. the only thing that stinks is that they do not have any happy hour specials, so mad dog & beans if you are reading this, please get on that!"
88,Anvita S.,1112,3,4/11/18,"tried the margarita tower which was great but pricy at for people they charged extra for mango passion fruit flavor . might be worth it to go with people to hit the sweet spot between price and quantity per person. we got about drinks out of it for girls.service was excellent, ambience is amazing, and food was.good. the chicken fajitas did not blow me away but the tacos at the table were a hit and easily finished they were on the small side . ended on an average tres leches.i got double charged on my credit card so watch out for that. oh and the door in the women's bathroom downstairs had a faulty lock so i was locked in for mins. hopefully they fixed that lol"
89,Karen K.,1112,5,10/15/18,"i've been wanting to try this spot out for some time already. i work near by & i've heard many good news of this location. let us start off with those delicious corn on the cob pictures that others have posted. i have to admit i've never tried it but on this evening, i swear it was the best dish on the table. i also tried the shrimp tacos, dish comes with small soft she will & a small order of yellow rice & black beans. i came with friends so we doubled up on the guacamole, which is made fresh, great portion & very well seasoned. we were seated upstairs for dinner, with our own bar. the food came out at a decent time being that it was a packed evening. the location is well spaced out, downstairs seems to be more active by the music & limited seating. the drinks, oh that sex on the beach was so good. we each had cost each, they were strong & kicked in quick. the service was great, our waitress was attentive & friendly she was quick with getting our drinks. inside decor is cute with a  wouldias de los muertos' decor theme. the pop of color went well with the restaurant. i spent all weekend thinking of that corn on the cob! but we will back soon for more drinks!"
90,Katharine S.,1112,4,5/10/18,this place is a dream in the summer. they are on stone street and have communal style outdoor seating.i recommend their blackberry margaritas and the guacamole! the guac is sooo good. a star for service
91,Cristina G.,1112,4,4/22/18,"last time i ate here, the food was not so great, but i'm starting to think it was just the specific dish i ordered. last night, the food was bomb and the service at the bar was on point. win!i ordered the original w strawberry marg off your first one when you check in on yelp which was delicious and strong. up next i tried the regular margarita with salt and it was, of course, just as good. for dinner, i ordered a chicken burrito with no dairy, and the bartender nailed my order. it was smothered in delicious sauces and not a trace of dairy in sight. yes! you would not believe how many restaurants look at me like i'm crazy when i ask them to hold the dairy. our bartender was awesome though.the last time i came here, i ordered the chimichanga with steak. my suggestion is skip that dish and try something else because the other dishes do not disappoint."
92,Jack M.,1112,1,10/13/18,"made a reservation for a large party. waited over an hour while the restaurant attempted to sort out the reservation only to discover that the group's table had been given away. was promised free shots and a table as soon as possible only to be told that we would not have a table. worst reservation experience ever.edit while my party and i spent several hours trying to resolve our issue at the restaurant, eventually we were able to speak to management about the experience who came out to meet our party at the adjacent restaurant . an honest effort was made to rectify the situation once the details had been sorted. while i regret that it took so long to resolve the situation, i very much appreciate the lengths management went to to make things right."
93,Martina D.,1112,4,12/31/17,"this is one of those places where i really wish it were out of and not stars. i would give it a . but it does not deserve a or . the burritos are a good size, and i've never gotten anything that tasted stale. having said that, although the ingredients are good and fairly fresh, the price is a little steep for what you are getting.the tacos are good, and so are the burritos. my favorite thing about the burritos is that they come with a little container with sour cream, chopped up tomatoes, and guacamole, all neatly separated. i kind of wish the burritos came cut in half, but that is a personal preference. i switch off from ordering from here and another mexican restaurant, which has similar portions and prices. i tend to lean toward the other one just because you have the option to swap out rice for quinoa, and i'm trying to be a little healthier.i definitely like this place despite the few complaints. i will keep ordering from here for sure."
94,Yuting G.,1112,4,8/14/18,similar to other reviews. this place has the best guacamole that i've ever had in the city!!!highly recommend to have the guacamole here.other food is just so so. the chicken wings come with wings! so it is a good deal to have the wings.i will simply come back again to hang out with friends with the guacamole.
95,Lisa B.,1112,5,10/13/18,had delivery twice and it was delicious! tonight i tried the chicken enchilada's and i will definitely get them again. the corn is amazing and so were the chicken tacos. food arrived quickly and in it was still warm.my only suggestion would be not to order the nachos to go. unless they can come up with a clever way to package them. probably a bad move on my part. they were tasty but nachos togo is not very ideal. i'm sure they are delicious if you eat there. i would take a picture but all the food is gone.
96,Marcel P.,1112,5,4/3/18,"you will not be disappointed if your looking for an authentic mexican spot, food is on point and service is exceptional. if you have a chance go to lacey's section, best waitress. she helped with what to order. and always came quick with water & drinks. was a great experience. thechickenchimichangasis so good. this is a must to order hands down!!! we will be back for sure."
97,Ariana F.,1112,4,8/1/17,"i've been here times this summer and the food has been good every time. i've had the guacamole & chips, both types of sliders and the chicken chimichangas. the guacamole comes out fresh and delicious and the chips are nice and crispy. the sliders are little sliders that i have as a meal every time and they are perfect. thechimichangaswere crisp on the outside and stuffed perfectly on the inside and topped with sour cream, guacamole and cheese. the service is always good, attentive host and waitresses and i've never had to wait for a table even when the place is packed during weekday lunch hour around pm . i have not had a problem walking the few blocks there and back on my lunch break and being back at work within an hour. the restaurant is nice inside and there is plenty of seating downstairs and upstairs and the prices are great for the area."
98,Dao L.,1112,5,6/20/17,"went here for yelp event. the food and service were on point!we were served mild guac and chips. the guac contained more tomatoes than i usually liked mine but the ratio kinda worked. it was delicious. the guac came in a large shallow bowl so it was misleading on the amount of guac. do not dip too much guac per chip lol. . also had, a strawberry, mango, and electric blue frozen margaritas with salt. yes, i am an alcoholic . the margaritas as well prepared as there is good amount of alcohol in them. i got tipsy on my first drink but i am also a light weight asian. next thing we had were grill corn with cheese. and o m g, it was so good. i inhaled the corn in less than a minute. the corns were prepared well, it contained all the moisture and the sweet juice from the corn goes well with the hint of spice they throw on it. highly recommend.later came thechickenchimichangas. it was good but nothing special. lastly, we had the churros with some strawberrys.now, i always get my churros from some random lady in subway station for . so that is what i compared it too. the churros in this place is undersized and a bit too hard in texture compared to the subway churros. the service ."
99,Jillian L.,1112,4,6/20/17,"it is been a while since i had some good margs and mexican food. mad dog & beans totally hit the spot!this may be my new summer spot for margaritas! they have a ton of fruity flavors and they give you an option between frozen and on the rocks. the frozen margs are where it is at! the consistency is very smooth and not icy at all. they use fresh fruit purees to make their flavorings. i tried the frozen mango, frozen blood orange, strawberry on the rocks, and blackberry cucumber on the rocks. our server was nice enough to mix the two flavors for us. out of all, the blood orange frozen marg was my favorite.for food, we ordered the following large guacamole the guac was my favorite of the night! i think that i make a good guac, but i think mad dog may make a slightly better one.mexican corn perfectly charred and smothered in mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder. it comes on a stick for easy eating. i'm always a sucker for anything with mayo and cotija.chickenchimichangas my expectations forchickenchimichangasare low. i've had too many overly friedchimichangasstuffed with dry, flavorless shreddedchicken. thechickenchimichangasat mad dog are nicely fried and filled with moist, tastychickenand lots of cheese.churros w chocolate dipping sauce the only way to cap off the night. enough said.overall, mad dog & beans is a great place for mexican food! the food and drinks are on point and the staff is super friendly! looking forward to coming back soon!"
100,Diane H.,1112,4,6/20/17,"margaritas, margaritas, margaritas!!!!my top choices are passion fruit, spicy, and cucumber, made with their house tequila.their guacamole is really good and made fresh! i had spicy but it definitely could be more spicy. still tasty though!also thechickenchimichangaswere delicious! looks a bit small, but actually was filling!! the corn was alright, not like the mexican corn i'm used to having back in california. & the churros with chocolate was slightly above average chocolate was very similar to the ones i've had in spain yum! , but the churros were alright.overall i would definitely come back again for their margaritas!"
101,Des R.,1112,4,9/10/16,drinks were excellent. not too crowded for a sunday evening on a holiday weekend. there was only one waitress though and she was slightly overwhelmed.blood orange margaritas are my favorite from here and we have officially decided the appetizer menu is where it is at. try the guacamole and thechickenchimichangas. food carries much spice so be careful if you are sensitive to that sort of thing.if you are in the financial district stop by. it is worth it.
102,Ericka S.,1112,3,3/10/13,"i've been to mad dog and beans for lunch as well as drinks & appetizers. overall, md & b is a solid mexican spot. the atmosphere is nice it is well decorated and it has a cool vibe. if you enter from the pearl st. side, it can be a little confusing to get a seat, because you have to walk to the other side to see the person who will seat you. minor inconvenience, but it is no big deal.you must have the guacamole it is made fresh and you can have it mild, medium, and spicy to your taste. the tortilla chips are light and not too greasy. they complement each other well. the salsa is also good. i've tried thechickenchimichangas,chickenflautas, nacho appetizers. very delicious! from a drinks perspective, i have tried the sangria and it was very good.this is definitely a solid place in fidi, and a good place to have drinks and food. it is a little pricey, but considering where it is located, i am not surprised. if i was craving mexican in the area, i would go to mad dog and beans."
103,Sim D.,1112,3,1/5/13,"this is the closest mexican place from where i live, sometimes i come here when i do not feel like going too far for food. overall the food here is ok, a little bit over price. thechickenchimichangasis kind of unique, also the guacamole chips & salsa, grilled mexican corn and mexican hot wings are good as well, mahi mahi taco with guacamole is also a must try.what makes this place better is definitely the margaritas, there are many different flavors, mango, coconut, cucumber, blue margarita, etc. kind of strong but very impressive."
104,Heidi G.,1112,3,5/31/12,"service was very slow, but once we finally got waited on the food and drinks came quickly. sangria was just ok, mychickenchimichangaswere very good. my husband'schickentacos had small pieces of bones in them and the beans and rice that was served with his meal were not very tasty. my son had a burrito that was huge, he really enjoyed it."
105,Nicole M.,1112,3,3/6/18,this place is great for appetizers. i shared theirquesofundido amazing and medium guac with chips which was also excellent. the shrimp tacos were extremely bland and the pulled pork tacos were very dry and had an orangey tang to it. def was not a fan of either taco would say they kind of sucked. our waitress lorena was the sweetest cutie ever and so good at her job. will be coming back but only for apps. toloache has much better tacos as does tacombe and pretty much everywhere else. you guys need to up your taco game!
106,Melissa M.,1112,5,6/17/17,"came to this place based on the yelp reviews and it did not fail me! great food, great staff, and amazing environment. i had thequesofundidoand the steak cesar salad and both were amazing! do not forget to try a hurricane while you are here."
107,Evian D.,1112,5,3/24/14,"ok, so let me start by saying why i was hesitant to trying this place out . yelp reviews were very mixed, could not be sure if food was great or not . my friends have come here for drinks by never tried food so i had no real opinion from friends . it is deep in financial district and i live in hell's kitchen . the place does not sell authentic mexican but then again, most places in nyc are actually texmex and not real mexicanwith that said, what everyone agrees on is that this place has awesome strong margaritas, and i love margaritas!!! but it does not stop there, the food is actually very good. in fact, thequesofundidowas one of my favorites yet, full of peppers and onions and tomato chunks that made each bite a delicious succulent mouthful of fresh condiments with warm cheese on a warm tortilla flat! we also ordered the sliders and the nachos. again, another pleasant surprise, the buns were crisp yet soft and warm full with a generous helping of the meat. the salsa was thick and not watered down and fresh and gone too quickly well, what can i say, i love salsa and chips the margaritas were amazing, and to have such a good selection of tequilas was very nice!shout out to the frida and to partida tequilas on the menu for not a bad price considering the cup comes full!the feel maybe more of an upscale chillies. but with the space. this is a perfect space to come and chill after work or with good friends, get a table and drink some great margaritas and share the bites in between!!i absolutely loved it and am planning to be back several times with my friends.as my tradition, i really do think this is a great place for a fun second and third date and make it a spot because the lighting is low, the music is cool, and the staff is super friendly and margaritas definitely help keep the party going!!!good job mad dog!!!reasons why i would return . tequila list is great . different bites full of flavor . happy hours are half price margaritas . the bartender amanda was sweet and friendly and offered her advice on best picks from the menu! . ambiance is comfy and rustic but also can be romantic"
108,Erin C.,1112,3,9/2/11,"if you have to travel a great distance to visit this restaurant, it might not be worth it. we ate the guacamole,quesofundido, and a shrimp enchilada. we ordred the guacamole spicy and loved when it came out with a pile of chopped jalapeno peppers on top. it was fresh and delicious. thequesofundidowas pretty good however, the cheese could have been a better quality and it was too large of an appetizer for two people. i do not think we would order this again. the enchilada was pretty good. it might have lacked some excitement, but was still tasty. we also had the classic margarita on the rocks. this was also pretty good, but i believe they have added sugar into the mix. the sugar killed the fresh flavors and the tequila flavor. the best part of this restaurant is that it is located on stone street. the outdoor area was absolutely lovely and exciting. we will definitely be returning to this restaurant. it is not an authentic style mexican restaurant, but it has all the cheesy, saucy goodness of a texmex restaurant."
109,Donna H.,1112,3,8/30/11,"the atmosphere could be okay, but sadly the restaurant more often than not seems to be overrun by frat boy and exfrat boy but still living the dream wall street types. so then why do they get a thequesofundido. my god thequesofundido! have you ever eaten something so delicious that it brings tears to your eyes with each bite you think, it cannot be as good as i remember! but then you take another bite and it is! that is what thisquesofundidois. so if you are lucky enough to live close by, delivery!!!"
110,Henali P.,1112,5,4/13/11,amazing mexican food & strong margaritas!! thequesofundido& guac are deliciousss.
111,Amy C.,1112,3,6/5/09,"i came here with some girlfriends tonight for dinner. our initial collective reaction was simple awe at how high the prices were. i kept joking about how even chipotle is overpriced for rice, beans, and carnitas at about per person. at this place, our bill came up to per person there was of us so you can do the math .we all shared one platter of nachos the one thing that keeps bringing back my friend who suggested the place . the nachos did live up to the high expectations she would set up for me. as my main course, i ordered appetizers the tuna ceviche yummy! andquesofundido too heavy and too oily . i also tried a bite of my friend's steak quesadilla which i thought the meat was overcooked and the flour tortilla was undercooked.for dessert, i ordered the churros with melted chocolate dipping sauce. the churros were delicious, but the chocolate sauce was so watered down i could barely taste the chocolate. one of my friends ordered the churros with tres leches dipping sauce and she also reported that her sauce was very watered down. our waiter brought out a mad dog cake a flourless chocolate cake served with fresh fruit and drizzled in chocolate sauce on the house. the cake was not warmed thoroughly and tasted like it was sitting out for a while. it also sat in a shallow pool of the same watered down chocolate sauce that came with my churros.our waiter was nice and we all loved the music and decor. if i go back, i would definitely order the nachos and ceviche again."
112,Christopher P.,1112,4,7/31/08,"the food here is good, though nothing i've tried is remarkable. i'm quite happy to have a new choice of food down in this area. unfortunately, like everything else in the immediate area, it is overpriced and the drinks are stingy. the service is very friendly, but it can be slow when they are busy.i found the food to be surprisingly authentic. they serve freshmade guacamole in a molcajete, though it is not made at your table like at rosa mexicano. the tacos are made with small corn tortillas as they should be, and the serving of four leaves you just enough room to snack on guac or another dish.thequesofundidois served with the same tasty little tortillas. like any good authenticfundidohas more veggies in it than the typical cheeseandmeatinabowl disaster of the same name the veggies makes it sit less heavily in your stomach and add a lot of great flavor.the tampiquena is a great carne asada with lots of fixings. if i get guac before the meal, i cannot finish it all.if you are looking for a larger serving of texmex, the fajitas are good, though no different than you would find anywhere else. i have not tried the burritos, as i can get that sort of texmex fare anywhere. someone else here complained about the size of the tacos. anyone complaining about tacos not being of the absurd usual american size has clearly never had real mexican food and can be safely ignored when reading reviews of mexican restaurants. most common mexican foods are served from street carts and are made to be good for holding in your hand and snacking on. huge tacos and burritos of the american style simply do not exist there. "
113,Angela T.,1112,3,3/9/18,"this is a great hang out place and definitely good on a friday night if you want to feel buzzed. the vibe was great, the waitresses were nice, however they do get busy and swamped, so the service might not be the best during busy hours. i waited min before i got my utensils and water after being seated, so if you are looking for great service might not be good to come during busy hours.we ordered the giant liter tower of blood orange margarita appetizer mexicanhotwings entrees steak enchiladas with rice and beans , pulledpork burrito bowl , and the fish taco with a side of rice and beans we only had people, which means one liter per person. we should have gone with more people. the prices were decent especially in the fidi location. the foods were mediocre, very typical spanish cuisine. thewingswere seasoned very well with just the right amount of spices, not too spicy. the pulledpork came with the finishing touch of crisp on the top which was nice. rice and beans were very typical. fish taco and steak enchiladas were very typical like any other spanish restaurant. the drink was strong, we each had about glasses and we were buzzed for the rest of the night. they also give yelp checkin % off the first drink, so it is not a bad place to come after work if you are in the neighborhood."
114,Tara B.,1112,3,5/3/17,visited today nice decor fast seating at around lunch time. we ordered themexicanhotwings no spice at all. just color steak nacho very good grilled corn no flavor enchiladas good from what i heard from my boss . overall nice spot will come back to do happy hour and try the margaritas.
115,Timmy H.,1112,5,6/27/16,i recently just started working in the fidi area and decided to check this place out. the frozen margaritas here are awesome! the tequila menu is very impressive and has a wide variety of different tequilas available. i would highly recommend this place to anyone in town looking for a cool spot to have a few drinks after work especially if tequila and margaritas are your thing. i have not tried much of the food yet just themexicanhotwingswhich were great! i will definitely be back and am excited to try some of the other appetizers and entrees on the menu.
116,Brittany J.,1112,4,5/17/16,great queso fundito &mexicanhotwings. their margaritas are pretty awesome too. great atmosphere for after work. meet some characters in this place.
117,Thomas D.,1112,4,7/18/15,i liked this place. the food was a little expensive but get themexicanhotwings. those are really good! the drinks are good and for me strong and i am ft lbs.
118,Grace B.,1112,4,7/5/15,"great place to go for good times and food. came here for dinner right before the th of july fireworks. the hostess was great in accommodating our party of as we kept changing our mind on being seated outdoors or indoors to try to make sure we had plenty of time to catch the fireworks.we finally ended up being seated indoors upstairs no wait time and were promptly approached by our server. when we did not have our drink orders ready yet, she briskly left. we finally placed our drink and appetizer orders. i got a frozen margarita unflavored which cost and was surprisingly sweet flavorful and strong! for appetizers, we gotmexicanhotwingswhich were for wingsand came with dipping sauces and cole slaw although they were very flavorful without the sauces. we also got guacamole, medium spicy which had a nice hint of spiciness without being overwhelming in flavor. i ordered the gorditos which are actually listed in on the appetizer section but the portion size is large enough for it to be more than filling for an entree. i got the corn tortillas with chicken in them. yummy! love the green sauce that comes with it and the corn tortillas are so dense, soft, and moist!the vibe downstairs is also great and the place always seems to be packed. a solid choice for a guaranteed good time with friends any day of the week."
119,J C.,1112,5,6/2/15,"visited a few times. loves their guacamole andmexicanhotwings! margarita is delicious. great place, very relaxed atmosphere but a bit too dark. will definitely go back."
120,Matthew P.,1113,5,11/8/18,good eating.absolutely good eating!!!get a pastramni and corned beef sandwich and do not look back!
121,Andre C.,1113,5,11/8/18,"this is one of those classic new york experiencespastrami , corned beef, lots of pickles and beer!the crowds and the waiting in line are a bit overwhelming but all tourists love it"
122,Pete F.,1113,3,11/7/18,"i would like to know where new yorkers go for pastrami's. when i was there, everyone looked like tourists. i have to believe new yorkers do not pay for a pastrami sandwich, no matter how good it is.for me, it is a once and done. the pastrami was very good. but we have equally good pastrami at langers back home. and i do not experience nearly the sticker shock, including for a scoop of slaw.and that outdated new york attitude i can do without. is that intentional for the tourists or do they just really do not give a f. the only smile i got was from the cashier. call me old fashion but a few smiles would be nice when i m shelling out for a soup and sandwich with a side of slaw."
123,Amy R.,1113,3,11/5/18,this is quintessential nyc. be prepared to wait! suggestions . split a sandwichthey are huge seriously like over a pound of meat on each! avg sandwich . seat yourself and order at counter this takes less time and is part of the experience . drink water sodas are like . do not go during regular mealtimes line can be around the block . enjoy it for the experience!
124,Adrian A.,1113,5,11/2/18,"why cannot i give this place stars or even ! this place is literally the embodiment of what a sandwich should taste like. if god goes down from the heavens to eat a sandwich, i am % sure he or she would eat here. this deli joint feels like a dmv from the inside with disneyland lines from outside to their order counters. the employees are the best as well because they give this place that nyc feel, hardworking, tough looking, but very helpful. they have collection of pictures of famous people on all of their walls and that is a sight to behold. anyway. leggo on the food shall we.i ordered their pastrami sandwich, which is melt in your mouth.their sandwich is simple a meat which is pastrami for me and a rye bread. their meat feels like butter when you are eating it. i am actually having foodgasm by just describing it. their rye bread is thick enough to hold that juicy, meaty goodness, not to mention it is best the best dough in the business, as well. my girlfriend ordered their corned beef, which we shared half and half. this, too have the same quality as the pastrami, so you can nevet go wrong ordering what.for the our refreshments, we ordered their egg cream shake. so good, taste like a way better version of an eggnog. it is the right drink to compliment the best sandwich i ever had. yes, i said it! no doubt about it! overall, if i get bored, i would go to nyc for a day just to eat here. that is how i love this place ps hey why is my picture not on those walls ! i am famous being yelp elite lolpss i can only dream haha"
125,Renee C.,1113,5,11/4/18,"this is a nyc bucket list destination, and it is also good as hell. when i went there, i was initially overwhelmed with the restaurant system when you enter, they give you a ticket, and when you leave, you give them back that ticket.i ordered a pastrami sandwich they give you slices to sample, and it was perfect. i knew i was going to have an enjoyable gustatory experience. the pastrami was perfectly warm, and the mustard was perfect. it was the best pastrami sandwich i have had in my life! they also sell these craft sodas, and the diet cherry coke does not even taste like diet!i'm not going to lie, the sandwich is a bit pricey . ! , so it is not a place i will be frequenting often, but it is a place that i need to go to once every months."
126,Hung N.,1113,4,11/2/18,there is one in houston where i live. i have always wanted to go to the original one in new york. we got that chance today it was an interesting experience.when you walk in they give you a ticket even if you are not eating. that is how they keep track of people and keep them from trying anything sneaky because you have to provide the ticket when you leave and use it to pay. we opted to go to the counter and order directly from the chefs. we got the pastrami on rye cuz you just have too. it came with a pickle and a slightly pickled cucumber. i must say it was quite good. i added their mustard and it it spiced it up even more. it had a great smokey salty flavor and they pile the meat pretty high.i'm glad i was able to take this off my bucket list and they did not disappoint.
127,Victoria O.,1113,5,11/6/18,my review from years ago disappeared.best chopped liver in the world.best pastrami in the world.best franks in nyc. that magical crisp of the casing when you bite into the dog.matzoh ball soup good but not as good as nd ave deli.terribly crowded so do not expect to get in and out in minutes. even the takeout line is long.the ticket system for entry and exit is confusing and bizarre. do not lose your ticket.cole slaw great and the portion is huge.
128,Tiffany P.,1113,5,10/18/18,"is . for a pastrami sandwich worth yes!after seeing the amount of reviews this place had and how expensive a typical sandwich can cost, i had doubts about this place! ugh, i was totally wrong. this pastrami sandwich was the best i have ever tasted. literally. the texture of the meat was just so juicy and plain, how can that sound so tasteful right the serving was a good sharing portion if you are not too hungry. they also serve pickles and cucumbers on the side to go with your sandwich.this place left me missing new york "
129,Saxon M.,1113,5,10/14/18,"this is the best sandwich i've ever had. not being dramatic. get the reuben sandwich with the pastrami. it is melt in your mouth good. love the character & history of this place. the pickles & cucumbers are a great addition.btw the ticket system is kind of confusing if you have never been here. when you walk in everyone gets a blue ticket. this ticket is where your order is written on. you have to have one to exit, even if it is blank. if you try to exit without a ticket they will charge you ."
130,Linda W.,1113,3,10/21/18,the cutters are super cool and give you samples before cutting the rest of the meat.the guy at the front door was rude and annoying though.pastrami on rye was as good as i remember.tons of meat!!
131,Cynthia D.,1113,4,10/19/18,"i've heard about this place for years from online reviews and food tv shows so when in nyc recently, i made it a point to check it out.it is everything that you expect if you have seen photos watched a show that featured the place. old school dinerlike atmosphere, friendly employees and expensive but huge! sandwiches with freshly cut meat. i will agree with what someone else said since i think it accurately describes my feelings as well it is delicious but i would not say life changing. we got there around pm and there was no line to get in, however, there were lines behind each counter inside there are maybe of them . we did not have to wait long to order though the counter line we got in only had two parties in front of us and it moved pretty quickly. we ordered the hot pastrami sandwich that came with cheese and mustard on it and an assortment of pickles on the side. we also had an onion bagel with cream cheese and tomato . there were two of us and we shared both items it was a lot of food. we did not even finish everything! the hot pastrami sandwich was good but typically i like my pastrami cut thinner. i also think the mustard is a necessary addition to the sandwich. it was very dry when i would get a bite that was just the bread, meat and cheese and i was happy they had more mustard available at the tables.overall, we enjoyed the experience and it is fun to dine in and see all the old pictures and feel like you are part of something that is remained pretty unchanged for many years in the city. however. i will say that i feel this way because we were able to get right in, get some food and enjoy. if i had waited min or more to just get in the door, i do not think i would have been as pleased. i do not think the food is that great that it is worth the long wait times. just my two cents!"
132,Katie L.,1113,2,10/9/18,"go to sarge's on th rd ave for a hefty pastrami sandwich and quintessential nyc experience! they put the deli in delicious, not katz's.after hanging out in the les, katz's pastrami sandwich and a cream soda sounded like a winning combo at am. however, expect some attitude on the side, especially by the bouncer harassing people for tickets when they leave. a great way to swindle more money from unassuming latenight patrons, who are not paying attention to a raffle ticket handed to them at the beginning of the meal. i misplaced mine briefly, and they were not going to let me exit. i did find it stuffed in one of my pockets, but their attitude was find it.or else .the pastrami sandwich itself is fine, if a bit fatty and hardly lb like they advertise. it is large enough to share with a friend, if you do not want your digestion to work overtime at the crack of dawn. harry & sally's table is clearly marked, to the delight of my movie fanatic friend, who made sure to sit underneath the sign. overall ok to do once, hopefully without the bouncer exchange at the end. i still say go to sarge's in murray hill all the way!"
133,Kevin S.,1113,5,11/2/18,"i've been going to katz's for many many years.and to be honest even though the place has raised their prices the food is as awesome as ever.over for a pastrami sandwich at most places would make me think about going in there,however katz's over stuffs these sandwiches and when ever i ate a pastrami sandwich there it was yes stuffed and juicy.added to that the home made fries and a couple of cans of dr.browns cel ray soda.i'm always around that area ans the place is never empty,especially on a thurssat night when people are going to the nearby bars and clubs there is a line outside for people to enter.one of the best deli's for their food,atmosphere and amazing staff!!!!"
134,Jacob D.,1113,5,11/4/18,"sandwiches so good. did not know what to expect as i made the line on a saturday. lots of tourists making their patronages. but it was worth it. wait was not too long even though we were wrapped around the side of the building. they hand you a ticket as you walk in for each person . do not lose it. if you do they assume you got two sandwiches and two sodas which is around . you head to whichever cut station has the shortest line when you get in. tip go in to the cut station furthest from the door, generally the shortest line.you pick your meat and they give you a plate with some small slices to taste to let them know you like it.their pastrami is what they are known for from instagram and it is so delicious. a little more fatty than the corned beef sandwich which i got as well, so that gives it a little more flavor and a leg up over the corned beef. matzo ball soup, superb. it is a huge ball so you could probably share it between two if you are getting sandwiches. got sides of fries and coleslaw yum as well.tables have ketchup and mustard. mustard is good. add extra to your sandwiches.if you are paying with credit card, go to the counter beyond the cut stations."
135,Pam B.,1113,3,11/4/18,"long drive from hotel, and wait outside and get ticket inside, which you must present to show payment or pay a fee. had pastrami sandwich & potato salad which i did not like, too much mayo. sandwich was not that large, pastrami flavor and tenderness were lacking, bread was dry. have had better pickles too. other diner had turkey that was on dry side. cheesecake was disappointing, in texture and flavor. waiter seemed annoyed for most requests. would not go back, very disappointed. miss other popular deli that has closed."
136,Emily C.,1113,5,10/6/18,"katz's is definitely an iconic spot in nyc and is so well known for their pastrami. there is usually a huge line so either come really early before the crowd gets there or come really late when it is way past dinner time. i came really late for a late night option and did not have to wait at all. the cutters are not too friendly, actually depends on who you are. i had a cutter who was friendly to the customer in front of me but was indifferent towards me.once you walk in, each person is handed a ticket regardless if you plan to order or not. make sure you do not lose your ticket since it is your way out too. then you go up to any cutter station and order from the cutter. they would give you a small sample of the meat that you chose while you wait and then write the price on the ticket. there is a separate counter for ordering fries. after finishing your meal, you exit by handing in your ticket and paying.i tried the famous katz's pastrami on rye and added swiss cheese. the pastrami was absolutely delicious. it was so tender and practically melted in my mouth. the mustard that they have on the table adds a nice contrast of flavor to the meat. the cheese was placed in between the cuts of pastrami which made it melt a little and tasted great. the bread was also soft and soaks up the juices from the pastrami but does not get soggy. they also give you types of pickles one is definitely more pickled than the other but the sourness and crunch factor is necessary.i definitely think that it is a must try spot since the meat was so delicious but it is definitely pricey. be prepared to spend at least on one sandwich."
137,Alexandria T.,1113,5,11/5/18,"pastrami was amazing, the sandwich is huge and big enough to share. i had a hotdog cooked well done, it was okay, def good for the price. the hotdog was juicy and the skin was a little thicker than i personally prefer.the line was incredibly long, we first got in line a bit outside. we still got our food in ~ minutes"
138,Alyssa P.,1113,2,10/2/18,"ummm. i feel like i'm in lala land. the food was. kinda tasteless. kinda bland. kinda flavorless. kinda not worth all the talk. kinda wondering what is going on with yelp. kinda think this is one of those places that became a thing and everyone pyschs themselves into thinking it is amazing.anyways. service was not that great. server had an edge. who would have thunk it. a nyer with an edge lol.anywho they have the stupidest ticket rule. they are killing trees to hand out ticket number. your ticket gets written on when you pay for food. if you do t get any food, you must return the ticket. lost tix are .so you order the food, someone writes on the ticket then you take your ticket to pay for the food.why on earth do not you order your food, pay for it and wait like other places i have not idea. crowd control i suppose and that just means they need to reconfigure the ordering process."
139,Jenilee C.,1113,4,11/1/18,"this place is a zoo, and for good reason. we got there mid afternoon, on a monday, thinking we would have a short wait and i guess you could probably consider a minute wait short at katz's.they keep you moving through the line as quick as they can, to get you to the cutters. it seemed quicker for us to order at the counter than the people who were separated and waiting to be seated and order at the table.we had our heart set on a reuben which we are familiar with the corned beef version. our cutter was kind enough to suggest we try both that and the pastrami before we committed, and i'm so glad he did. the pastrami is where it is at. it was so moist i know everyone loves that word and delicious, it was not a fair fight. my mom and i were able to split one sandwich comfortable and it was served with a variety of pickles. they stack the sandwich high with meat, russian dressing and sauerkraut. the only thing i would have changed is the option to toast the bread, as we normally do. but i would still eat it again untoasted. well done katz's!"
140,James A.,1113,5,2/18/18,"food is great but pretty pricey. i would recommend going here if you have never been at least for the experience of tasting a new york city food institution.i had thekatz'scornedbeefhotsandwichon rye with mustard and the matzo ball soup. the rye was soft like it was baked that day. thecornedbeefwas so full of flavor and had the perfect fallapartyourmouth texture you expect from goodcornedbeef. the matzo ball soup had one nice big matzo ball that was not overcooked like some others and the broth was nice and balanced. would be a great soup for a cold day if you are not feeling well. if you live close enough, they deliver! both thecornedbeefhotsandwichon rye and the matzo ball soup were perfect examples of new york city culinary mainstays.sometimes there is a line outside but it usually moves pretty quick so do not let that keep you from stopping by if you see a large queue out the front door."
141,Kait A.,1113,5,1/29/18,"if you are craving a pastramisandwich, you will not be disappointed. yes, this place is a bit touristy and expensive due to how famous it is from when harry met sally, but i will not like. it is a greatsandwich. prepare to wait. or come early and beat the lunch rush. hold on to your ticket!! bring cash!!absolute must katz'spastramihotsandwich . russian dressing. mustard. rye bread. tons of meat. delicious. steak fries . also good katz'scornedbeefhotsandwich . square potato knish . round knish with potato . i always go for the pastrami because i just cannot help it. theircornedbeefis also amazing you can order it lean if you would like by the way. thesandwichesare huge so you could definitely share one if you are not starving."
142,Marie Y.,1113,3,9/12/17,first time being in ny. first stopkatz's. no debate. landed at am and we still went to get pastrami as our first meal luggage in tow.we arrived to a super empty restaurant. we were actually the only ones there. the guard hands you a ticket and you approach the counter. they take your order and get to work. while they are making you yoursandwichthey give you samplings of the meats to get your approval. after completing the order they ask for your ticket stamp what you go and give you back your ticket. you take your trays to any open spot and chow down.we ordered the katz'scornedbeefhot sandwich our secret dry cure pickling formula requires a full month to be ready to serve.i really did not enjoy thecornedbeef. the meat tasted bad. like it went bad.katz'spastramihot sandwich smoked to juicy perfection and hand carved to your specifications.the pastrami was good . should have just gotten a whole of the pastrami.after your meal you head to the cashier hand them your ticket and pay cash.overall i thought there was too much hype. i prefer la's langers. there i just said it. running away.
143,Kelli S.,1113,4,7/5/17,"visitingkatz'sdeli is probably the # thing people recommend when you tell them you are going to nyc, as far as food goes. we made it to the famous deli on memorial day at around p.m. we did not really set a time for our visit, but it ended up being a good time to go. there were still people in there dining, but it was not nearly as hectic as i'm sure it can be during the traditional lunch hour.you get a ticket when you come in one per person and you can either go to the deli counter to order yoursandwich, or you can opt to be waited on. a section of the restaurant is reserved for those who want to be led to a table and served, and part of the restaurant is for those who order for the counter and seat themselves. i knew this going into the restaurant because a friend had told me. however, it was still so overwhelming to order from the counterpeople were hording the spaceso i just asked if we could be seated and have a server. you have to retain your ticket that you get and turn it in when you leave lost tickets a fee and you pay for your meal when you leave.since the deli is crowded, they make use of every square inch. we were seated at a longer table and shared it with another couple. the boyfriend preferred to order oursandwichtogo and enjoy it in a more peaceful place, but he did not mind the crowd so much once our meal actually came.katz'smenu is hugethere is a lot you can choose frombut it is not a booklike spread like sarge's menu. there are a fewhotsandwichesand coldsandwichesyou can choose from, but there is also a breakfast menu, grill favorites and a bunch of specials you can choose from. since this was our first visit and everyone raves about the reuben, we just decided to share that, but there is plenty of options if you want to try something different.since it was not as crowded as it could be here, considering how famouskatz'sis, our food came out relatively quickly. it was delicious, in a different way that our sarge'ssandwichwas, and i'm glad we made it here to try that famoussandwich.here's what we got reuben of course, when you go tokatz's, you have to get either the pastrami or the reuben. since we had sarge's reuben the day before, we had to compare! we ordered the reuben fromkatz's, which featuredcornedbeef, swiss cheese and a russian and sauerkraut combo. this was a closedsandwich not open faced like sarge'ssandwich , and it still contained a generous portion of that juicy, tender meat. but, i felt like thissandwichhad more ingredients in it at least more of the mixins. i could really taste the cheese and there was more sauerkraut. our reuben from sarge's was more straightup meat and less fuss and frills. the twosandwicheswere slightly different to us and tasted slightly different so we could not determine which was better, per say. we appreciated eachsandwichfor what it was.katz'ssported a smoky flavor and the meat was super tender. i loved how i could taste more of the cheese and sauerkraut in this one, and whatever russian sauce they used was killer! i can see what all the hype was about. we shared thesandwich, but since i was still full from lunch, i only had a few bites and let the boyfriend indulge in the rest. katz'scornedbeef if i ever came here again, i would want to try thecornedbeefhotsandwich. i think when it comes to the meatier options, i preferhotsandwichesover coldsandwiches. this version sounds good it features the eatery's secret dry cure pickling formula that requires a full month to be ready to serve. katz'spastrami the boyfriend and i agreed we would probably want to try this famous pastrami the next time, since it also came highly recommended. the meat is smoked to juicy perfection and hand carved to your specifications. rumor has it that you do not need mayo for this one . the meat is just that flavorful all on its own!new york cheesecake if i had room for dessert here, i would want to order one of the famous nystyle cheesecakes! creamy and sinful, this cheesecake is supposed to be fluffy, delicious and a musthave for any dessert fiend. i cannot wait to try it one day. and i would just get it plain no fruit toppings necessary."
144,Eric S.,1113,4,6/5/16,"she will have what i'm having.uuunnnggghhhh well here we are, at one of the most famous businesses in all of new york, which thus makes it one of the most popular places in the world with nearly k yelp reviews. our last day in manhattan found us on the lower east side. knowing that we could not leave without getting a legendary pastrami on rye, we stopped in at pm on a tuesday and the place. was. packed. this was not a weekday lunch rush mind you, just business as usual for this landmark jewish delicatessen.the system works as such every person that walks in the door gets a ticketdo _not_ lose this ticketand heads to the slicing counter. something like or cutting stations servecornedbeef,hotdogs, salami hard or soft , and pickles. from there, it is a waiting game until you reach the front of the line. each carver will give you a free sample of whatever meat you desire, kinda nice of them.once that is done, find yourself a seat good luck . crowds will likely be heavy at any all hours of the day, so plan accordingly. i would recommend that one person in your group scout a table while the others wait in line for meaty sustenance. speaking of food.every order comes with varieties of pickles is considered a fresh pickle essentially a cucumber that is brighter in color, while the other is a more traditional sour gherkin. these are a refreshing addition to any lunch plate and is just one of the many things that has putkatz'son the map.besides those yummy pickles, we enjoyed a good quality bowl of the matzah ball soup . we also got an order of latkes aka potato pancakes for those came with sour cream and applesauce. a plate of fries was , which is straight up ridiculous. cans of soda are . the pastramisandwichis a whopping and comes with a whopping lb ofhot, juicy meat. i recommend the deli mustard to go with it. unlike carnegie deli, atkatz'syou are more than welcome to shareand you should, since it is a huge portion.bread . circuses yup, the totally hilarious scene with meg ryan and billy crystal from 'when harry met sally' was filmed here. you know, the part where they meet up for lunch and billy's character says something to the effect of men can tell when women fake an orgasm , so meg's character says something like watch this , and then does all the moaning and whatnot, yada yada yada. director rob reiner's mother, estelle, then proceeds to deliver perhaps one of the greatest lines in the history of film. i do not think i have to tell you what it is. in fact, it is such a flawless bit, it was voted rd on the list of alltime best movie quotes. there is a nice sign recognizing the moment.due to the cultural significance, i'm proud to call it my th uploaded photo.elsewise, the ticketing method was weird. i understand the purpose to discourage theft of reubensandwiches , but the bouncers at the door came across as overlyaggressive. if you lose your ticket, that is a bullsh t fee. no ticket no exit. do not pass go. do not collect pastramis. cash only, so come prepared with an assload of paper money.in closing,katz'sdeli is simply one of those 'must see' places. much like central park or times square, this restaurant has withstood the test of time and is essential for those vacationing in nyc. deal with the crowds, deal with the cost, and get a delicioussandwich.as for fake orgasms that will cost you an extra .____________ for those of you wondering did eric s have a stroke earlier the answer is no this is what climaxing might sound like if converted to text i would not know, and do not bother asking my girlfriend either! hiyo! double extra points my review is # , forkatz'sdeli, which is quite literally the breast timingi mean best timingever. but seriously, if somebody was going to be the th reviewer, it might as well be me. and why not most of my postings are already saturated with dirty puns and sexual innuendi, and if you think giggling at the number is too juvenile, then i weep for your lack of levity."
145,Lee P.,1113,3,4/5/16,"i guess east coasters have different deli standards than chicagoans. who is to say who is right. i thought thekatz'scornedbeefwas minimally seasoned and just ok. the rye bread was without caraway seeds and kind of bland. the dill pickle was nothing special. compared to manny's delicatessen in chicago,katz'sdoes not stand a chance.it is an experience dining here. i stood in line for a table, which turned out to be the wrong way to go. you should go right up to one of the cutters and place an order, then there are plenty of open seats in the back. but at least i got to sit with a couple from scranton, pa who own a bar and grill there. i asked the guy what he thought about thekatz'soperation. i just look at all the benjamin's, he remarked, commenting on the enormous crowd of people dropping for asandwich."

153,Davis D.,1113,4,4/21/09,"holy cow! after watching travel channel and seeing this as one of the musttry spots in nyc, i had to try it out and drag my friends that live in nyc with me. i had no idea about this place except that it supposedly had the best pastrami ever. we got here and it is pretty large and crowded, and filled with all kinds of stuff on the walls like pictures of celebrities that have eaten there, posters, beer neon lights, etc. they also had bread crumbs everywhere on the floornot sure what the purpose was but i'm sure there is a good one.it did not bother me. anyways, you basically walk up to any one of the chef's behind the counter and there was of them , and you would tell them what you want.i ordered the pastramisandwichof course along with my friends. i just had mustard, and pickles on the side with it. the chef pulls out a huge slab of smoked meat, and cuts off a couple slices for you to sample first before he puts together yoursandwich. he made oursandwiches, which were filled with at least an inch and a half of pure smoke pastrami. i took my bite, and words cannot describe how amazing it was. the pastrami here is out of this world. sliced nice and thin, with a nice, crisp peppery crust, juicy, moist.all worth it.be prepared to spend some coin here though. you are looking at at least per person. mysandwichwas alone, and though it looks small, you will be surprised how quickly you feel like you will have a heart attack. none of my friends were able to finish it, including myself. in the end, i paid about for everything because of drinks etc.i highly recommend this spot if you are in nyc.you cannot be disappointed, and i wish they had a spot like this in ca.i thought ca had good pastrami joints, but i was wrong. if pastrami is not your thing, they havecornedbeef,hotdogs, and other types of delisandwiches. a must try."

160,Sue W.,1113,4,10/10/18,"this is definitely an iconic jewish deli. after my friend posted, another friend commented she remembered this place as it was down the street from her grandparents and we are already seniors! i had an omelette, which was advertised as oversized as person i could easily pack it in. the best was my friend'smatzoballsoup huge but nice fluffy light texture and yummy! and pastrami sandwich. the pastrami is made in huge batches and is really excellent not the oversalted overpeppered stuff you get in supermarkets. they serve all with good homemade crispy pickles. this is the place where meg ryan had her harry met sally scene."
161,Tori G.,1113,5,10/9/18,"well this is one of those must see places of nyc. it is really easy to get to from pretty much everywhere and the lines seriously run like a top. the rhythm and flow of people in this deli is perfect! even as an out of towner, i was able to go through this restaurant pretty easily and get everything i needed. and yes, it is different. there are lines for everything and you are given a ticket upon entrance. your totals are put on that ticket so do not lose your ticket!!!!! the absolute best meal, hands down, is the pastrami on rye with a side ofmatzoballsoup. out of this world!!!! the side of pickles was worth the taste and pretty good but i could not get over the freshness of the deli meat and thesoup. in fact, it was so amazing, i seriously considered ordering some to send to my home five hours away! i cannot say it enough, this was a must see place for a trip to new york city. i will absolutely go again and again, and again! "
162,Marcia P.,1113,5,10/9/18,"yes, it is a terrible tourist trap, but the food still lives up to the hype. just went back here for the first time in years, and it is as good or better than i remember. only problem is the line was longer! this is many traveler's first experience with pastrami and deli food, and it sometimes slows up the works. we took an italian friend here and he wanted to get parmesan cheese to put on thematzoballsoupand a glass of red wine with his pastrami! sorry, paolo, this is a nyc jewish deli! have a pickle and an egg cream and tell the amici back home all about it!"
163,Suzy Z.,1113,5,10/7/18,"i went there at about am i could not sleep because i was still on california time and decided to have pastrami sandwich for breakfast. when i got there, there was only one customer ahead of me. everyone was soooo nice to me. their pastrami melts in your mouth. theirmatzoballsoupwas alright. i would come her again only if there is no long ass line."
164,Tiffany C.,1113,4,10/1/18,"on every list of what to do in new york , this was food stop # on my recent trip to new york. knowing we had a packed days of pure eating, we knew we had to pace ourselves. between the three of us, we ordered the pastrami sandwich andmatzoballsoup. it was more than enough.walk in, order at the counter, eat, and pay after. order sandwiches in the middle.soupoff to the side. if you are wondering, that is how they do things. we did not know, and were a little confused at first. we lucked out and came right before the crowd, and so the staff helped us out.the pastrami sandwich had that melt in your mouth quality. no hard bread that scrapes the top of your mouth. not soggy that it sticks either. and thesoup, delicious. i've never hadmatzoballsoup, and so would have nothing to compare it with, but i liked it. not too salty, and was a perfect compliment with my sandwich.to top it off, there was a photo shoot held in the deli with models wearing high fashion clothing. made this a fun, truly unique new york experience!"
165,Clay F.,1113,5,9/27/18,the legends are true. pastrami on rye with mustard andmatzoballsoup. both were amazing. the place is a mad house. lots of activity. self service is fast. pickles were really great. glad we came.
166,Aileen M.,1113,3,9/24/18,"trust me, it is good, but for a sandwich is a bit too much. tried thematzoballsoupand it needs to be served hotter or something. glad i tried it but will not be needing to make another visit."
167,Blanca C.,1113,1,9/8/18,"what is the hype about for a mediocre sandwich, a hospital tastingmatzoballsoup, sad fries and terrible service.you can get the same quality food at any other deli for the price.do not follow the herd and run.to top things, i got sick from this food!!!! worst"
168,Nicole K.,1113,5,9/7/18,"katz's is nys classic deli. it is an institution. i have been on so many occasions but never really appreciated all of its ingenuity and beauty.they are known for their sandwiches pastrami, corned beef. they are on the pricier side but well worth. the meat is fresh and high quality. upon entering everyone is given a ticket and you order at various different counters. the slicing guys give you a sample of your meat as you watch them hand slice the meat for your sandwich.it is not just about the sandwich they offermatzoballsoup, sides such as fries, cole slaw and knishes.katz's has plenty of beverage options, and desserts as well. they do traditional blintzes and other jewish traditional foods.but back to the sandwich this is hands down the best sandwich in ny. the meat is so tender and made with such flavor and perfection. they like it on and each sandwich could easily fill two people unless you want it for yourself!"
169,Denise T.,1113,5,8/29/18,"ah, yes, a staple of our society in nyc for all nationalities. although, now living in florida, i continue to order from katz deli. why, where else can you get a taste of new york while living in another state superbmatzoballsoupto be shared with the delectable pastrami sandwich! but, to bring a taste of childhood would be to bite into the potato knish! mama mia, katz you bring tears to my eyes!!! this little brooklyn girl thanks you immensely for being able to live in the sunshine state, but always being able to bring her back home, of happier memories, with just the taste and smells of the legendary katz deli. thank god for your delivery service."
170,Sinan Z.,1113,5,8/25/18,this place really meets the hype!!the hot pastrami on rye is soooo great! i also got thematzoballsoupand i enjoyed it as well! the line looked really long but it moves fast. this is a musttry!!
171,Tiffany J.,1113,5,8/23/18,"worth.please come here.with over reviews and all the fame it needs, there is not much for me to say. the only beef i've had that topped this was texas brisket. enjoy the heap of pastrami between two pieces of rye and nothing else other than cucumbers and pickles . i love the conceptthe entire show is on the pastrami.otherwise, portions are huge, so be mindful. ordering can be confusing, and lines can get long, so ask before you waste too much time.thematzoballsoupis also pretty good. reminds me of the chinese meatballs from my childhood, but much softer. i also got to try chopped liver and kugel for the first time, which was. interesting. but i am certainly not qualified to say much about kugel or chopped liver."
172,Stevie P.,1113,5,8/4/18,the pastrami ruben is the greatest sandwich to grace planet earth. half sandwich halfmatzoballsoupat am after a night out is the only way you should end a night.
173,Torrie B.,1113,5,11/4/18,"katz's has been on my bucket list for a long time. i was browsing photos of their food before writing this review, and my mouth was literally watering as my fondly remembered my meal. my friend and i shared acornedbeefsandwich, fries, and free pickles. i absolutely love pickles and these were some of the best! so fresh, crisp, and perfectly complimented thesandwich. the bread, meat, and mustard were all on point and the fries were super yummy too. i wanted to try more sides andsandwiches, but we were just too full. later that night i had my first experience with heartburn and i can absolutely say that katz's was worth it. hope to go back soon!"
174,Mike B.,1113,1,10/31/18,"anyone that rates this place as great has never had good deli. first the acceptable. the pickles & coleslaw were good & it all stops there. the potato salad was awful, it had an aftertaste that has not left hours later. our friend had a mediocre chili dog & fries for , though i will grant that this may not be the place for chili. still very expensive. wife had half pastrami & split pea soup. she said the soup was good & got sick from the pastrami.i hadcornedbeefsandwich. the rye bread was the worst. no crust & spongy like brown wonder bread. thecornedbeefwas barely adequate.all of this for . + tip. it would be ok to charge absurdly if it was any good. it is not, do not go!"
175,Chris L.,1113,3,9/11/18,"came here with a friend to see what the fuss was all about. we split acornedbeefsandwichand a pastramisandwich. the meat in thesesandwicheswere absolutely top notch, but the bread was a serious turn off for me. really was not a fan of the texture or the flavor of the bread.also, there was way too much meat, nobody needs that much meat on asandwich. but i guess they really need to stuff thosesandwichesto justify the price tag.to sum up amazing meat butsandwichesare way overpriced. next time i come i will be ordering the meat a la carte."
176,Alex P.,1113,4,9/3/18,"had thecornedbeefsandwich. it was pretty good, just a little dry compared to othercornedbeefi've had.was not prepared for the prices. wanted to try the brisket but a sandwichwith no sides is pretty expensive, so me and my bf just split. thesandwichesare big, i do not think i would be able to eat one by itself. you can get a halfsandwichwith a side soup or salad , but its about the same price as a wholesandwich, so not really a good value in my opinion.environment was pretty cool, but definitely an odd system for ordering. do not lose your ticket. i think next time i would do waiter service just to avoid the cramped order line.overall, i definitely thinks it is worth trying but just know what to expect."
177,Chris K.,1113,1,9/3/18,"do not eat here! tourist trap and staff has dmv trained attitudes. high volume crowd system is extremely confusing. first you are given ticket and not told why. do not lose your ticket if you have a party member who is not dining and lose ticket a bouncer will block the door and not let you leave until you pay .next you have a long counter top with signs that say cutter , cutter etc but the staff does not tell you that you can go to any of these lines so everyone lines up at cutter # .next a staff member, dmv style, says what do you want then when you tell them your order they start talking to other staff members and do not acknowledge you. so i waited ten minutes for the staff to make my order. the staff slops the order on a plate and then calls for next patron why you wonder where to go next.i then went to look for beverage and wanted to pay.the beverage person then told me that i was in the wrong spot and pointed south. so i went south and that person sent me back full circle. i received beverage after complaining and then attempted to pay for my order. no waiter said you pay when you leave.next you look for competitive seating. picture trying to get michael jackson back stage tickets! oh i see a table but it has a sign that says waiter service table. so i did not understand since i had to get my own food, my own drink and my own napkins why would i need a waiter foodcornedbeefsandwich.meat was very tender and bucks or perfect for construction workers. meat tastes like it was boiled and then someone accidentally dumped a salt shaker on meat.then we left to pay for the wonderful meal and see the beginning of my post!"
178,Jane Y.,1113,4,7/29/18,"katz's delicatessen is a nyc icon for a reason, and i finally got to experience why firsthand. the housemadecornedbeefis good and the pastrami. omg that pastrami is freaking amazing! they sell so much of it so quickly, and they give you so much, that you are guaranteed to get freshly braised meat, and they give you so much of it, that you will quickly understand why it also costs so much for a simple pastrami cornedbeefsandwich. in addition to the meat, the men behind katz's deli counter have their customer experience down to a science . they provide you with a sample of the meat your purchasing. . if you are getting your purchase to go, you can request they package everything separately and they will do so without any qualms. meat in one wrapper, bread in another wrapper, pickles in a third wrapper, and all of your accouterments like the mustard are packed in their own containers.if you are in the area, or in nyc for a visit, it is worth putting onto your list of places to visit.there are two things that i do not like about this place though that prevents me from rating katz's delicatessen with a perfect score. they are the following . the line outside with a bouncer at the entrance and as soon as you step inside is well orchestrated and they are clear from the get go that you must retain their ticket or risk financial penalty. however, once you get past the two bouncers, it is kind of fend for yourself. you line up for the deli employee, but people cut, and openly push their way to the front of the line. . they appear as though they are a cash only establishment, but if you actually take a look, you can pay with a credit. the credit card station is at the very left of all of the lined up deli employees behind the counter."
179,Debi R.,1113,3,7/27/18,"i wanted to love this place. we were a party of and we all ordered something different.of course we ordered the pastrami andcornedbeefsandwiches. we also had cheese steaksandwiches, chickensandwichesand more. most of the meat was on the dry side. our overall rating of the food was average.the way you order is a bit confusing. upon entry you get a ticket. when you order your food, you give the server your ticket and they write the price it and return it to you. the same goes for ordering sides and drinks. you pay as you exit. if you lose your ticket, you pay .which would have been perfect if we lost ours, cuz after sandwiches, sides and many beers they would have lost money!staff was friendly and helpful when asked how to navigate the ordering system.the only time i said, i will have what she is having. is when i was asked if i wanted another beer."
180,Donathon C.,1113,5,7/10/18,"bestsandwichi ever put in my mouth!the pastrami and reuben cornedbeef sandwicheswere absolutely toecurling orgasmic othis was at the top of my todo list when i came to ny. ive seen a lot of documentaries and read lots of articles about this place and have been really excited to try it. you walk in, grab a ticket, and walk up to the cutting station where a cutter will take your order, take out the fresh cooked meat, have you sample, then cut the meat in front of you. you will then take your food to the left, grab a drink, then sit down at a table. they will mark your ticket as you order things.you pay at the end so keep your ticket!minimum charge if you lose it. you cannot get out without paying and or the ticket.enough hype, let us get to the food.i tried both their pastrami and reuben cornedbeef sandwiches came two days in a row . i know this place is famous for the pastrami but thecornedbeefwas just as good.the pastrami was to die for though! such good flavor and cooked perfectly. the reuben had melted cheese and their special sauce relish spread. totally made thesandwichnext level! i did not have sauerkraut because i'm not a big fan, but theirs was actually really good.here just look at my pictures. it tasted better than i could take a picture of.it is been an hour and my toes are still actively curling oi think i need to go lay on the bed now. enjoy the pictures"

182,S C.,1113,3,6/24/18,"worse than expected.cornedbeefsandwichwas good, but not great. overall, it was not up to the hype of its name. maybe too touristy now."
183,Nicole W.,1113,2,6/18/18,"i thought this would have been a good substitute for carnegie deli, but it is not.cornedbeefsandwichwas mediocre."
184,Tommy O.,1113,5,6/10/18,"ever since i saw katz's on man vs. food, i knew it was destiny for me to come here. pizza,sandwiches, and pasta are my favorite foods and i am a huge fan of pastrami andcornedbeefsandwiches. my buddy and i stood in line around am on a sunday. the line streaked around the corner, but it was not too bad as it moved very quickly. we were inside within about minutes. fair warning, during peak times, the wait time can get in between + hours. but with the ordering system in place, the line does actually move. once we got inside, it was a madhouse as there were a ton of people, but there was also a ton of seating.so i will give you a little scoop of how the ordering system works if you are too lazy to google it. the cashier gives you a ticket. make sure you do not lose this ticket!!! or you will be charged for a lost ticket. you then have three separate areas with lines to order sides soup hot dogs,sandwiches, and beverages. you can step up into any line and then you wait until you can order. then you give them your order and they make your food for you while adding your items to your ticket. when you order yoursandwich, you get to see them cut your meat and they give you samples while you are waiting, which was a very cool experience. once you get your food, you can go eat. the place is packed so be ready to be sitting next to someone in communal cafeteria style seating. once you are done eating, leave the plates on the table as someone comes around to pick them up. then head up to the cashier to go pay. so it is a relatively straightforward process, but because it is so busy, it can be overwhelming.now onto the food. my buddy and i ordered a pastramisandwichand acornedbeefsandwich. both on rye with mustard and we decided to split them. this was hands down the bestsandwichesthat i have ever had!!! the meat was full of flavor, juicy, and tender. the rye bread was soft and warm and the mustard added the right amount of flavor to not be overwhelming. words cannot how delicious thesandwicheswere.i will admit that the prices were pretty expensive. it was about for asandwichand bottled water. however, thesandwicheswere huge as they were at least a pound and i'm sure it is a fairly expensive cut of meat. they are big enough that you can split it between two people. so in my opinion it is worth the price.katz's is an absolute must try when visiting nyc! yes, it is a tourist trap and a bunch of locals come so plan your trip accordingly. thesandwicheswere hands down the best that i have ever had. even if you have to wait a long time, katz's is well worth the wait!"
185,Mary D.,1113,5,5/29/18,"a nyc staple! you have to go at least once, experience the bestcornedbeefsandwich, kosher pickles and german potato salad!"
186,Diane Z.,1113,5,5/19/18,where harry met sally! the best jewish deli anywhere. my husband and i shared onecornedbeefsandwichand it was more than enough. you must try the matza ball soupto die for! a new york must.

188,Raymond L.,1113,4,5/13/18,"personally not a huge fan ofcornedbeefsandwichesbut this, this is the place to go if you ever want to give it a shot. still a regular deli structured place, get in line, grab a ticket, order and hope for a table. their homemade mustard is on point and the pickles are excellent too. the one and only issue i have is withcornedbeefitself, it is very greasy. on the plus side, i'm a big dude and even half thesandwichfilled me so the value is there."

191,Roberta M.,1113,4,4/17/18,"i've been eating here for many years but never seen it as crowded as today. it is a tues at in the afternoon. not very comfortable sitting at the table with people standing on top of you and banging into your table. as they walk by they hold their tray loaded with food on it over your head. you just hope it does not fall on you. well, i noticed the prices have gone up again. now, acornedbeefsandwichis . and pastrami is . . wow a bit pricey. a can of soda is . . also had fries. total was . + tax. at least the food was good. cannot getsandwicheslike these anywhere else. i took mysandwichhome and will probably put some of the meat on another slice of bread. that gives me dinner for another night. it is worth it. that is why i keep coming back. love this place."
192,Patrick G.,1113,4,9/6/18,"i would never been tokatz'sdelicatessen before but we made the trip since we were in nyc.it was worth the trip. i had the corned beef on rye and my wife had thepastramion rye. now the corned beef was very good, but thepastrami. it was a battle worth fighting. we also had pickles and cole slaw, for whatever that is worth, but thatpastramiwas very very good. it might be the best deli meat i've ever had. it reminded me of brisket, probably because it can be made from that cut of meat. makingpastramiis a far more involved process than brisket production.the service was great. i got to watch the chef slice up the meat, a treat for me since i'm terrible with a knife. he handled that meat like he had cut it times, which is probably true. the place was crowded, but i hardly noticed. there seemed to be a party going on. good for them. the cole slaw was cole slaw. it is ok.i do not need to write anything else except have thepastramihotsandwichon rye. you will not be disappointed. if you are, it says more about you than the meat."
193,Julie C.,1113,3,9/1/18,"been wanting to try this place for awhile now and finally got the chance to do so. it is insanely popular and to be quite honest a little overwhelming if it is your first time. upon entering you get a ticket that you use to pay with at the end so do not lose this ticket!! then you either choose table service or you can go up to the counter to order and then seat yourself. my friend and i chose to order at the counter but we were so confused as to where to go or if there was even a line for counter service. when we finally got it sorted out we ordered thekatz'spastrami to share. this also came with a plate of pickles. happy we decided to share because thesandwichwas huge!! the food was delicious and definitely filling even though we each had half asandwich. there is ample amount of seating so there was no problem finding a seat. when it came to paying it was extremely chaotic because if you wanted to use card you pay in the back. the cashiers in the front only take cash, so just a heads up. paying cash at the front was no problem but then there were people behind us who were also trying to exit while we were trying to pay. why put the cashiers there if it is just going to because a traffic jam !"

201,M C.,1113,3,7/17/18,"everyone lied! not that great, tbh. living in la everyone tells you ny delis are so much bigger, better, greater. since this sentiment was pervasive, i started thinking it might be true. during my first visit to ny i wanted to try such other worldlypastrami. people said it would ruinpastramiforever. nope.this place was packed on mother's day, go figure. it was also raining. since we did not want to jostle at the counter, we waited for a seat. we waited forever. once seated, we immediately ordered a matzo ball soup, coleslaw, and apastramisandwich. the matzo ball soup was good. the coleslaw had a strange, offputting seasoning. thepastramiwas way too thick, like honey baked ham slices thick. cheese indiscernible. bread not a great canvas. we ordered anotherpastramisandwichto go and the quality of the meat was even worseit had copious amount of disgusting fat, ewww. i went through the entiresandwichpulling off the fat. never again. that is why the meat needs to be thin, so that the fat is edible and tender. cannot believe the prices for fattypastrami, i also did not think thesandwichwas very generous , meatwise, compared to la delis.not a fan and would never wait like that forkatz'spastramiagain."
202,Katie F.,1113,4,7/11/18,"being a fan of when harry met sally, we had to stop into katz before exploring more of the lower east side. let us just say this place is famous for more than its screen time.++ it is insanely crowded mainly due to tourists, like me! however, staff keeps the line moving and has their stuff down to a welloiled machine!++ i opted for the famous kat'spastramihotsandwich, which was plain and simple, but delicious! the bread is made in house daily and not toasted unless you ask for it , meat is freshly carved and cured for days! and a pickle is thrown on the side for flavor. want mayo got to ask for it!++ portions are huge in fact, we split the sammie and did not even need a side of chips! their other homemade sides looked and smelled amazing, as everything is made fresh daily!++ location is famous being on the corner of e houston and ludlow st, and has been a staple in the area for yeeeaaarrrrrrrsss! having opened shop in and had transformations throughout the years this deli is a wellknown, appreciated business in the neighborhood. parking is a nightmare and expensive so plan on a subway ride, or a walk if you are headed downtown.+ pricing is a bit steep but what can you expect for a piece of history in new york i would highly recommend coming here, and do not forget to have what she is having!"
203,Julie L.,1113,5,7/5/18,"i have to admit, i had low expectations for this iconic place and figured it was over hyped due to its notoriety.i was incredibly wrong. i do not know what they do to make theirpastramibut i have never ever had anything like it. i ordered the reubenpastramihotsandwichand while devouring it thought to myself that i would move to ny for this. locals complain about the price, it is + for asandwichbut i guarantee you have never had anything like it. katz is completely worth the hype."
204,Ra‚àö‚à´l R.,1113,5,7/2/18,i had a plainpastramihotsandwichand it was delicious. the bestpastramisandwichi have ever had. it was simple yet it felt like there was a party in my mouth. thepastramihad a lot of flavor. service was great. #raulvsfood
205,Joanna C.,1113,5,6/30/18,"wow!!! to be honest, i was a bit indifferent when we arrived atkatz's, perhaps partly due to being traumatized by eating slice delisandwicheswith no sauce or other filling for lunch almost everyday for something like years. but this blew away my nonexistent expectations.katz'spastramisandwich of course we had to try the classic, and it was probably one of the bestsandwichesi've ever had. the meat was so juicy, flavourful, and meltinyourmouth good. the layers ofpastramiwere twice the size of the bread that enclosed it. it comes at a bit of a price tag, over for thesandwich, but they pack it with such a generous portion of mouthwateringpastramithat makes it so worth it.it is quite interesting how ordering and paying works. as we entered, we were each given a ticket, even if not all were ordering something we shared because thesandwichwas so ginormous haha . then, we lined up at a cutter, who took our ordered, and also gave us a little sample of thepastrami! what a nice guy free food is the key to the soul hehe. after receiving our pipinghotsandwich, we claimed any open table, devoured our meal, and only as we exited, we paid. i think it is a pretty ingenious system, since it reduces the bottleneck of payment and front loads the traffic on the food preparation. that is also why everybody gets a ticket, and if you lose the ticket, you are charged a penalty otherwise it could have been that you walked out with a free meal .anyways, thesandwichatkatz'swas amazing and it is definitely somewhere i would come back to for a satisfying boatload ofpastrami!"
206,Gregory D.,1113,5,5/20/18,"my mission in life was to try akatz'spastramisandwichbefore i die. well i finally made it to new york city for the first time in my life. trip planned out perfectly. i would be eating atkatz'sthe day before i left. so i get there pm on rainy night and because of the weather no one is in the place. this was my lucky day. no lines, no wait. it would be just me and mysandwichin no time flat. i get up to the counter and tell them i want pastramisandwiches. the gentleman behind the counter tells me, we ran out ofpastramitoday. i told him i wanted to eat the bestpastramisandwichin history. he replied, well you are part of history, it is probably the second time in five years that we ran out ofpastrami. i told him that is not a part of history i want to be part of. he gave me a business card and told me to call tomorrow, but do not count on thepastramibeing delivered because deliveries were usually on tuesday and this was on sunday. so, i took my corned beef reubensandwich, which was a great consolation prize and tried to stifle my tears at the table. the next day i called realizing some things were not meant to be. lo and behold, thepastramihad been delivered on monday. i jumped in an uber and waited in line minutes at pm in the afternoon to order fourpastramisandwichesto go and one to eat there. after scouring the place for a seat i sat down to eat mysandwich. i took my first bite and all i could think of was heaven."
207,Kristina O.,1113,5,5/5/18,"had thepastramihotsandwichon rye and it was delicious. i do not think i have ever eatenpastramibefore, but i do not think i can ever eat it again unless it is atkatz's! thesandwichwas huge and big enough to split between two people. we had to wait in line to get inside and then they give you a ticket to order at the deli where you order yoursandwich. we were in and out of there in an hour."
208,Dana L.,1113,5,4/20/18,"i know this is a super hyped tourist destination and for that reason i was not super stoked about going to this place as i knew that the lines and the prices would be overthetop high. that being said, once i got there and got through the masses of people and the insane lines that we experienced at pm on a saturday, i was not disappointed.i ordered katzpastramihotsandwichwhich came out to about . this is a hefty price tag, but thissandwichis piled about . inches high with fresh,hot, deliciouspastrami. it was definitely more than large enough to share with another person. i ate only half of mine and i was extremely full, so if you split it with someone the price is not too bad. i got mine with swiss cheese, mustard, and mayo on the side. it also came with a side of pickles and cucumbers.honestly, much to my surprise because i do not really likesandwiches this place was one of my favorites on my weeklong trip to new york and i would say it is a must try! do not let the lines or the tourists scare you away!also, they have a part of the store where you can send salami home to your loved ones or yourself. i'm not judging , so if you are looking for a unique gift you can check that out."
209,Allison H.,1113,5,4/20/18,stop reading reviews and go tokatz'sdeli. people complain about staff but pro tip put a tip in their jar before you order. i guarantee you they will be all smiles and might even throw in something extra.the food heaven. if nyc were a flavor it would bekatz'spastrami.
210,Alex O.,1113,5,9/17/18,it is iconic for a reason. i personally do not likeroastbeefsandwichesbut i indulge in pickles and cheesecake! great late night meal after hitting the bars around the area. perfect late night date night 
211,Cathy M.,1113,4,9/8/18,"we could not leave ny without trying out a classic deli, and we definitely wanted to try the most famous!location towards the lower east side, this deli is literally on the corner of the main street so it is very easy to spot.line wait there was already a line out the door the moment we arrived. once we entered, we were given tickets to hold onto do not lose it or they will charge you , and shuffled into various lines to order our food.tables you can either put your name down to have them find you a table and be serviced, that would take about minutes or you can do self seating. all of the tables towards the wall are reserved for service, but the ones in the center are all self seating. my friends had me find a table for them, while they ordered my food. i recommend doing that if you are not going alone! tables are extremely cramped, pretty difficult to find, so if you find an open table, keep it.ordering system is so confusing. there were cutters for the meat, so if you want just asandwich, make your way to the furthest line the back, because there should be less people waiting. once you order yoursandwich, they will put the price down on your ticket. there is also a separate line for the drinks, if you want to try their cream sodas. you pay at the kiosk before you leave the restaurant!menu katz's is known for their pastrami, so that is at the top of their list. if you are not a pastrami person, there are other options like tritip orroastbeef. you can order the wholesandwich, which is about persandwich, or you can do a combo of halfsandwichand a side for about ! most of thesandwichesare pricey, but they will definitely make two complete meals.here's what i ordered halfroastbeefsandwich . i was so excited to try the coldroastbeef, but was disappointed by the lack of flavor. the quality was outstanding, perfect medium rare, tender and juicy, but it just needed some sauce or mayo. my friends tried to put mustard in it for me, but i did not enjoy it much. i regret not getting the pastrami instead.small side salad it was in a plastic box, i do not know how long it was kept out. the lettuce was a bit wilted, i was not too happy. i should have gotten their soup instead.pastramisandwich so this was my friend's, he had me try part of his since i was not too pleased with myroastbeef. this was absolute perfection, nothing like any pastrami i've had back here. the meat was so tender, it reminded me almost of brisket. it was smoking and piping hot when my friend unwrapped his. definitely worth ! it was so much that he took the rest to the airport with us.conclusion definitely order the pastramisandwich, nothing else! do not make the mistake i made! the ordering system was a bit confusing, but i guess it is the only way to cater to large masses of customers. my friends told me the cutters were not too nice towards them, since my friends were confused, however, they let it go. i thought they had quite an honor system going on, since you basically pay at the kiosk before you leave the restaurant, anyone could easily walk out without paying. i think they should come up with a better system, but it might be hard since they are so busy and popular!"
212,Megan N.,1113,5,7/27/18,"this deli is so good, try theroastbeefsandwich, french fries and latkes. the lines are long, but the staff are organized about it and get you in fast to enjoy their yummy food."
213,Latasha H.,1113,5,6/11/18,uh the food is amazing. i had theroastbeefsandwich. i had so much meat on mysandwichi made like sandwichesextra. its so delicious. they give you so much meat.
214,Sabin J.,1113,5,5/28/18,excellent choice. worth the wait. got theroastbeefsandwich. go there hungry. do not go there knowing you are going to pack your meal to go.
215,The T.,1113,3,4/10/18,"i got to tell you, i was a little disappointed from what i was told. the pastrami was amazing, i will give this place that but be ready for very thick cut. since pastrami is fatty, when you bite into thick but pastrami, expect it to be tougher to chew.roastbeefsandwichwas not good at all. it was very tough to chew. fries were incredible.this place is a madhouse, which is understandable since it is famous and very busy. however the way their lines are set up once you get into this place is pretty bad. it is like a cattle call and your battling to get to a guy to make yoursandwich. thesandwichesare or more and not worth it. i will not come back."
216,Bree R.,1113,3,8/22/17,"for oldtimers who can appreciate a classicroastbeefsandwich, i totally get the appeal! but me personally, i found theroastbeefto be extremely dry and overly salted to the point where i needed to sip water with every bite! thesandwichis truly beastly and a quarter in, i got a stomach ache. it is all about the hype. this place has been around forever, and everyone who is anyone has their signed portrait hanging on the wall, so katz lucked out and somehow became a restaurant icon in nyc and a mustdo for tourists. the restaurant has an oldschool diner feel, the food is incredibly overpriced, french fries are cheap and flavorless and security at the entrance is stressful. it is definitely not my thing, but i guess you should try it if you have not before! it is just my one opinion!"
217,Mickey W.,1113,5,10/17/16,"this is a legendary deli that has legendarysandwiches. once you bight thesandwichyou will love it. i am a huge fan of both cornedbeefandroastbeefsandwiches. absolutely outstanding. highest quality meat and made with such care you can taste it.this place is a must go to place. with its similar and rival deli carnegie closing you just cannot take these old new york staples for granted any more. so come, patronize, keep them around so the legend can continue into the future!"
218,Letty C.,1113,3,9/16/16,"i was born and raised here in nyc, this was my father and i go to spot in the seventies when i was a child. this side of town, les or lowe east side was suspect and gritty like much of old new york city. i would sit at the counter and stare at the pics on the wall of hollywood patrons of this iconic establish like sammy davis jr., frank sinatra, and barbra streisand. i would order pastrami and dad would order the lentil or split pea soup. the workers were friendly and they talked about george steinbrenner and our home team the new york yankees with dad.that was then.the sit in counter has been replaced by an assembly line ofsandwichcutters who cut over pricedsandwiches. i paid . for aroastbeefsandwichwith tomatoes and pickles.no sides or drink. . .seriously.when you enter you move thru a turn style, you are given an orange ticket.you give that ticket to the man at the deli counter he writes on the ticket what you ordered.you sit and eat, soak up the atmosphere.and then you use that ticket to pay the cashier.complex right the cashier takes your orange ticket and attach your paid recept which you must show the big bouncer dude when you exit. seriously.its a tourist spot.gone are the days of a cozy warm meals at the counter. its an assembly line of unfamiliar and over priced vigor.this was so disappointing."
219,Cee G.,1113,5,4/27/16,"what an experience!! katz is the type of restaurant that every city must have that engages people of all ages. they have so many items on their menu that will sure satisfy most all taste buds!! famous for their pastrami androastbeefsandwiches, their hot dogs burgers and fries, assorted pickle variety, and much more.katz delicatessen contains so much history that people from all over, including royalty, celebrities, politicians and more, have left their prints or memories within the restaurant either as a framed picture, garment piece, wall writing, etc. it is a definite must stop here if you travel to new york city and are in the lower manhattan area. you will not regret it!!if you are lucky you get to meet the owner alan dell and he luvs to take selfies with people!!the food is always satisfying. never a complaint. all smiles in the restaurant. and always packed to capacity!! amazinnnggggg!!!"
220,Jane B.,1113,5,4/27/16,"katz's deli is a mustvisit for all new york foodies! yes, it is an extremely touristy place to go, but i have no problem with that! the classic neon sign and divey diner decor are very charming. they also have a sign above the table that meg ryan and billy crystal sat at during the infamous scene from when harry met sally. you can stand in line and get your food to go or sit at a table to be waited on. the menu is pretty basic, not too overwhelming sandwiches, soups, sides and a few desserts. all of the food is phenomenal very fresh! it is no wonder why people ship meat from the deli all over the country. the prices are insane, but we expected that going in. in my opinion, the food is totally worth it.thesandwichesare enormous as you can see from the pictures . i was very happy doing the halfsandwichand soup deal for my lunch. i started with a matzo ball soup very good! i chose theroastbeefsandwichwith cheese, coleslaw, lettuce and tomato. it was one of the best delisandwichesi've ever had! unfortunately, my aunt ordered the pastrami, which is their most popularsandwich. that was also amazing!i would recommend avoiding the p.m. p.m. lunch rush. i went with a party of three at a.m. on a weekday and we did not have to wait at all! within the hour, the line was out the door and wrapped around the building."
221,Adam C.,1113,3,2/29/16,"katz's is so damn busy it is not funny. when i first walked in i thought it was a market. you order your cornbeef pastrami roastbeefsandwichesin any of the line and do not ask for anything else in those lines. i made the mistake of asking for chicken noodle soup it was cold outside and the guy seemed a bit annoyed but he said i gotchu which was nice of him. i ordered a reuben, but subbed the cornbeeffor pastrami. the flavor of the pastrami was just ok, very juicy, but i do not see the hype. it is expensive. i probably will not go again."
222,Eric F.,1113,1,10/30/15,"i'm from ny and know good deli but this place is not. yes you get a hugeroastbeefsandwichpiled high with meat but the quality is so so. for . yes . i expect better taste not fatty and tasteless.i appreciate the tourists spending their money here but spend it elsewhere. better yet, eat somewhere more reasonable and buy a homeless person a meal with your savings. you will be doing a great service for someone who is hungry."
223,Fern M.,1113,2,9/8/15,"my husband and i took our company from out of state to katz's delicatessen on houston street.we were handed tickets and told they had to be returned when we left or pay a penalty. we decided to have waiter service. so we sat in the service area. a nice young man came to our table, or so i thought he was nice. can i take your order. no introduction! we needed a few minutes so he came back a whole minutes later. he took our order. i ordered the blintzes, my husband, the halfroastbeefwith pea soup and my company ordered a pastramisandwich, knish and blintzes. while waiting for our food i noticed our waiter kissing a girl and running his bare hands through her hair.his bare hands through her hair. the waiter returned with pea soup and bread with the bare hand he touched the girl's hair with. i questioned him about his bare hand and the use of only one glove. he nastily replied what does that have to do with anything. my husband explained what i saw and asked for another soup and for the waiter to put on another glove. the waiter went to talk to someone at the other end of the deli. he was shaking his head no. i do not know what transpired but he put on two gloves. while waiting for the soup to come out,my husband stepped out briefly. during this time i also notice one ofthe men behindthe counter while makingsandwiches was rubbing his hands all over his face, using hishands to wipe his immune nose. when our waiter returned, the waiter brought over the soup and started to bring out the food and sodas with paper cups, which when wet became soggy and hard to hold.as far as the food is concerned the blintzes were good. my company's pastramisandwichwas good, not great, but good. the knish was well overpriced aseverything else but was good. my husband'sroastbeefsandwichwas very fatty, almost half of it could not even be chewed.during the whole time we we were there the waiter did not come over to us to see how things were or if we needed anything except to bring us the bill which only the total amount was written on one of the blue tickets we received when we first came in. when the waiter wrote the amount on the ticket and handed it back to us he said cash only and to leave my tip on the table . what nerve.the point of this review is not to totally bad mouth katz's as i have not spoken to the owner s yet neither of them could be found. i paid my bill. i did tell the cashier all of the above. she was speechless.as soon as i got home i called katz's. the owner will be in between and tomorrow expect my call.i gave two stars only for the food. at those prices we have been given real glasses to drink from instead of flimsy coffee cups to drink soda from."
224,Brad D.,1113,2,9/2/15,"we came here for a late lunch during our first visit to nyc because i've heard lots of great things about the famous katz deli. we ordered the pastrami & cornedbeefsandwiches, matzo ball soup, and aroastbeefsandwich.the soup was good. thesandwichesare large, with lots of meat, but the flavor of the house cured meats were lacking. and these are priceysandwichesat around ea. the meat is hand carved, so the slices are thick, which means that the chewy fat pieces are thick too too thick. i think thesandwicheswould be better if thinly sliced.all and all, it was ok, but i've had better delisandwichesin l.a.it was a shame to pay so much for just an ok delisandwich."
225,Vika C.,1113,3,5/12/15,"today me and my husband finally decided to check this place because of a lot of people talking about this diner and how greatsandwichesthey have.but i was totally disappointed, i cannot tell that it is totally bad, but i thought that this place will be the best.that is why i give only stars. we had pastramisandwichandroastbeefsandwich, the bread tasted like from deli and meet nothing special."
226,Kinjal N.,1113,4,8/24/14,"they give you a number when you walk in and you order based on that number.do not lose the number of they will charge you!i came in with a friend who wanted to eat theirroastbeefsandwichand she did so one mind blowing bite at a time.the place was packed and has the when harry met sally quotes all around the place.that and the meat shop atmosphere with a restaurant on the side gives it a very different character than anything i've ever seen. oh, and be prepared to wait. there is pretty much always a wait."
227,Rebecca W.,1113,1,7/13/14,"worst service i've ever experienced, and food is mediocre at best.the deli operates on a ticket system where they expect you to return the ticket upon exit. not knowing this policy, i lost my ticket since i was accompanying friends and did not buy anything. while trying to leave, i was informed that i needed to produce the ticket or pay a fine.even after i recovered my ticket and tried to leave again, the staff accused me of fraud and did not believe that i had not eaten anything. i am a lb girl, i do not eat after midnight, i have a stable job, i literally have no motivation for lying to this man. yet, while i am calmly speaking to him, he is yelling at me and telling me that i am belligerent when he is the one raising his voice and i'm merely trying to understand the situation at hand.i am very disappointed with this establishment because i had heard so many great things about it. however, these reviews were from my drunk wasted friends and we all know that everything tastes better while highly intoxicated. the half brisket roastbeefsandwichi got was fairly average and not memorable enough to face the horrible and traumatizing experience with the staff during my visit.for your own sake and everyone that you know, spare your time and energy and do not go to katz's awful deli where the security guards have major complexes and would rather have a fight than a mature conversation. year old girl who appreciates drunk food and wishes that she had a good time here"
228,Nicole M.,1113,4,7/1/14,"visiting from san diego with my boyfriend who is a new york native.came to the infamous katz, but like some others. will not return.i'm impressed by their amazingly kind and down to earth staff even through all the hustle and bustle of regulars and tourists.there is always a line, but it moves quite quickly.every adult must receive a ticket at the door which the waiter or deli man will write your prices ticket must be presented upon exiting to pay for meal. unless waited on i believe.my boyfriend and i opted to get in line at the counter and order. our guy was super friendly. cut up samples of the meat from thesandwicheswe ordered to munch on as we wait and watch oursandwichesbe made.we lucked out on getting a table. pretty difficult since no one seats you and tables are trashed as you walk around. but the bussers come around frequently to clear out tables.as for sides. we had coleslaw which was amaaaaazing and mac salad which was alright. too wet saucy for my liking.a can of soda is . . which is an obscene price.the price of asandwichranges from .did not realize that until we saw the menu inside.for cans of soda. a reuben and a pastramisandwich. mac salad and cole slaw. our total came out to about bucks.though thesandwicheswere very delicious. the prices are a bit ridiculous. still cannot get over the . for a soda. haha.all in all. i came for the experience as a tourist and the popularity it gained from when harry met sally. i probably would not come back again. maybe only to try theroastbeefsandwich which i heard has great reviews."
229,Shawn K.,1113,4,6/25/14,a staple of nyc.do not come here often since the portions are pretty large. most people get the pastramisandwichi always opt for theroastbeefsandwich. avoid the weekends you will have to deal with b&t or tourists. midday lunch is always nice.
230,Playboy B.,1113,5,11/7/18,no place in nyc compares to katz the bestbrisketsandwichon the planet the pastrami amazing corn beef awesome turkey too good steak fries rock the old fashion root beer the hot dogs the knishes the cheeseburgers the philly cheesesteaks the soup the coleslaw the pickles the reuben the egg creams the draft beer the bologna the salami what else can i say katz is out of the world!!

232,Tutti S.,1113,3,9/27/18,"first of all there is no parking lot. and yes i know this is nyc. hostess was helpful, with suggesting i use a parking app, since the parking meter was broken.i ordered thebrisketsandwichwith baked beans and fries. they serve an impressive amount good of meat on theirsandwiches, so that is a plus. the meal over all was okay, but not great."
233,Majes W.,1113,4,9/24/18,"hmm not too sure what all the hype is about. all the hotsandwichesare now. i got the pastrami andbrisketsandwichand katz cheesesteak. both thesandwichesi thought were way too dry and overt expensive for the size. i did enjoy the cheesesteak the most, that was very tasty and juicy.be prepared to wait and do not lose your ticket they give you right when you enter, you will need it to pay and leave!"
234,Cindy F.,1113,5,8/16/18,"came here on a thursday just after pm. was not too busy yet and there were tons of tables open. you get a ticket when you first walk in and they make sure to tell you to not lose it there is a charge if you do . first station is a grill station where they have burgers, dogs etc. second is thesandwichcounter where you get pastrami, roast beef, turkey,brisketsandwiches. next station is where you order sides and drinks. it can get a bit confusing. there were cutters behind the counter when we got there but when it started to get a bit busier, another cutter opened up further down the line. just get in a line.we got a pastrami on rye with mustard and a roast beef on rye with mayo and a side of fries. bothsandwicheswere fairly pricey + but worth it. the cutter gave us some pastrami and roast beef to try. the pastrami was moist and warm with tons of flavour. the roast beef is served cold and rare and was pretty good with the mayo.sandwichescome with some pickles and pickled cucumbers. they give you roughly oz of meat in a wholesandwichso it is huge! fries were not bad but nothing special either. they do have mustard on the table if you want more which i ended up using with the roast beef as well.by the time we left, the place started to get fairly busy. i'm not a huge pastrami fan but i would definitely eat here again"
235,Jez M.,1113,4,7/25/18,"quite a long way out, but my son wanted to go, so we trudged there after going on staten island ferry. it was good to see china town and little italy, on the way and some interesting locals around roosevelt park. i would suggest getting the subway there, which we did to get back to time sq.it is an iconic restaurant experience, portions were as expected large, i had the matzo ball soup & halfbrisketsandwich mybrisketwas a bit dry, my son had the ruben which he really liked, my wife had pastrami, she only managed to eat half so had the rest wrapped. was the most expensive meal we ate all trip. but at least we can say we went there."
236,Tony S.,1113,5,7/19/18,"katz deli is everything you will ever need !! experience the historic ordering process and enjoy all that katz deli has to offer. do not be shy ask the good people behind the counter for reccomendations or advice , i chose the pastrami andbrisketsandwich! a+ for quality and a+ for service. make sure to get the blitzes for dessert you will not be disapointed"
237,Naeem H.,1113,4,7/11/18,"while the katz's deli unfortunately is not filled with seductive moans like that iconic scene from when harry met sally , it is filled with the sound of postmeal sighs from very full and very satisfied customers.the restaurant is very busy most of the time, which is surprising given the outrageous prices they charge. however, i mostly forget about the cost after getting my hands on one of their famous hotsandwiches.katz's does meatsandwichesbetter than anyone else i've seen, and it is hard to go wrong with the pastrami, corned beef, orbrisketsandwiches. overall, it is expensive, but absolutely delicious and wellworth at least one visit. i guarantee you will not be disappointed."
238,James B.,1113,5,7/5/18,"how have i not reviewed this amazing place before now!! i love this restaurant!! one of the best in the city if you are into meat!! while i'm trying to cut down my intake of it, i still enjoy a greatbrisketsandwich. you would be hard pressed to find one made better than this place. want to talk about comfort food go here and get asandwich, you might finish half but the other half you will be taking to go. unless of course you are not human then i guess you can eat the whole thing. but an alligator would be full off half of one of these babies. great deli meats, great steak fries, great service. you cannot go wrong here!! it is pricey though."
239,Syyu C.,1113,4,6/29/18,"pastramisandwichis amazing and lives up to the hype. priced at , worth that and more, delicious meat which melts in your mouth. chaotic and always packed on the weekends.this is cafeteriastyle seating offering either table service or self service. if you want self service, pick up a ticket and wait in lines of to order. you then have to find a table there is more seating towards the back restrooms.also tried the beefbrisketsandwichand it was really dry. only recommend the pastrami. onesandwichwas enough to share between two people."
240,Deanelle A.,1113,5,5/22/18,"whether you are a local or you are taking a trip to the northeast coast like i did, you have to stop by and grab asandwichfrom katz's! first off, the line was out the mf'n door but sooo worth the wait. promise! they got it pretty organized in there and it is pretty simple, follow the signs for ordering. there are different lines to stand in forsandwiches, sides drinks. but the place is booming with people a character!you get to the counter and they automatically offer you a sample of the meat and let me tell you.that meat just melts in your mouth no pun intended . there are huge steamlike containers that hold the meat and the cooks are constantly pulling out massive slabs of meat slicing them, continuously moving. almost like a fluent dance ! we ordered a reuben and thebrisketsandwichwith a side of fries.thesandwichesare huge. i was full off of just half of it! the bread was soft but unable to withstand the stack of meat placed in it. the spread also made it softer and easier for thesandwichto fall apart but who said it was supposed to be eaten like a princess lol this girl sho' did not eat like a princess, more like a savage !as a warning, this was probably the most expensive meal i had while out there! with the twosandwiches, one side of fries and drinks it came out to be approximately . it was definitely an unforgettable experience and one to have on occasion."
241,Andrew P.,1113,5,4/13/18,"very good pastrami. i would highly recommend sticking to what they are famous for and that is the pastrami. now if you want something with more flavor, get the rueben with pastrami. it was hands down our favoritesandwichand we also tried the turkey and the beefbrisket. the turkey andbrisketsandwicheswere very basic, so the pastrami was definitely what everyone liked the most."
242,Chi N.,1113,5,3/29/18,this place is on steroids as in the size of thesesandwichesand the amount of patrons that go here. we waited in line for mins and we get to try different meats and finally decided on pastrami andbrisketsandwichesand also had the soup. worth the wait!!! yummm
243,Burg B.,1113,5,3/4/18,bestbrisketsandwichin nyc !! katz has the bestsandwichesin nyc!! the pastrami the corn beef the turkey the steak fries the knishes the hot dogs the burgers the root beer the pickles everything classic!!
244,Lorin B.,1113,5,1/19/18,"one of my best new york nights was spent at katz's deli. i highly recommend the beefbrisketsandwich. you will get enough meat for two meals. i got mysandwichat pm, got home by , was able to finish half of thesandwichand the other half was breakfast. what a deal! i do not know if a bettersandwichexists. my friend i was with was so impressed by the service she tipped dollars on the spot. if i had the cash on me, i would have tipped . no joke it is that good!"
245,Stacey T.,1113,4,12/21/17,"a staple for my jewish family, we have been making the pilgrimage here from nj for as long as i can remember, although since i moved to the city about years ago it is been a lot more convenient.we always go the self service route, how it is meant to be. bring some singles to tip thesandwichmakers and they will likely give you some nibbles while you wait. if you have a pickle preference make sure to let them know i'm all about the half sours! our recommendations are the square potato kinish, corn beef you can get it lean if that is your preference , pastrami, and thebrisketsandwich. if you are with a few people, get a side of cole slaw to add to yoursandwiches. do not forget the amazing mustard and in house russian dressing. the french fries are nothing to write home about but my dad still loves them. wash it all down with a doctor brown's soda black cherry or cream are the way to go .keep in mind if you go during prime time dinner it may be a zoo, but i've only encountered this a few times."
246,Daniel C.,1113,4,12/13/17,"before we came to nyc, everyone said to come to katz's delicatessen and get the pastramisandwich. they also advised to not lose our ticket that we get upon entering. if everyone says to come here, we had to come here. make sure to bring cash because they are cash only. we got to the restaurant around lunch time. they advised us at the entrance, where you get your ticket, that we could wait for a table which will have a server to serve us or we could get our own food from the cutter then find an open table to dine on. there was a wait for a table and the place was not too busy so we took our chances to go cafeteria style.while i was standing in line at the cutter section, someone dining behind us left so mink quickly took the table. score! there are two sections in the restaurant. first section is the meats andsandwiches left and middle of wall . second section is the grilled items and soup far right of wall . i first stood in line for the meats andsandwichesbecause the line was shorter. you will get a sample slice to munch on while waiting for the cutter to prepare your order. i ordered pastramisandwichand brisketsandwich, both with no mustard. it came with two types of pickles. the pastramisandwichis probably one of the best, if not the best, pastramisandwichesi've had in my life.brisketwas very good too but you have to get the pastramisandwich. the pickles were legit! as full as i was at the end of the meal, i ate them all.after ordering in the meat andsandwichsection, i stood in line in the grilled items and soup section. mink wanted a grilled cheesesandwichand i wanted a bowl of their matzo ball soup. the soup broth was very good and the dish complimented the meal perfectly. mink really enjoyed her grilled cheesesandwich. service is very friendly in the entire establishment. there is also free water in the back that is self serve. the restaurant is constantly busy so keep that in mind. you will pay as you leave. if you have never been here before, you have to come here. until next time that i will be in nyc, i'm going to dream about coming back here."
247,Jennifwr C.,1113,1,9/22/17,"what a let down! multiple people recommended this restaurant to us, so we decided to try it. first of all, their system is horrible. they give you a ticket to get in and then you have to wait in three different lines to get everything you need. the first line is for the matzo ball soup.which is served warm but by the time you get thru the lines and find a table, is no longer warm. the soup was decent but ive had better. i tried the beefbrisketsandwichwhich was flavorless and very fatty. i wanted to send it back but i was honestly afraid to because the staff was less than friendly. to make matters worse, after i went thru the lines, i could not find the ticket they gave me at the front door. i searched everywhere for it while the manager stood there and watched me.i could not find it so she said i had to pay them , which is their policy for a lost ticket. after i pushed back a little and started to sweat from embarrassment, they gave me another ticket and did not charge me. keep in mind, this is all before i even sat down to eat! one last thing, for a halfsandwichand soup it is close to and that is before you add a drink, side and gratuity. if the food was good, i would not mind paying those prices. but, given the poor quality of the food and the poor service, it literally pained me to pay my bill. i do not understand what all the hype is around this place! i will not go back."
248,Amanda A.,1113,5,8/9/17,"bestbrisketsandwichyou will ever have. oh my god, so juicy, tender and flavorful. they let you try the meat before you order too, so if you are not % sure what you want, ask for a sample. if you get there before noon, you will not have a problem with the line, most likely. we arrived around am, no line at all, got oursandwichright away, and got the table under the she sat here sign, in reference to when harry met sally. word to the wise, do not misplace your ticket. you will have to pay a fee if you lose it, even if you do not order anything. it is cash only, and sandwichwill run you about but it is worth the price and the wait."
249,Yoomee H.,1114,5,9/19/18,"it was kinda late and my family and i was looking for a place to rest and eat something, somewhere. and i did not know that crystal, my little sister led us to this place called luke's lobster. i was so down to try their famous lobster rolls, so we decided to eat here!crystal ordered lobster rolls, shrimp rolls, poppy slaw, and a side of salad. i had the lobster roll and it tasted really good!!! the girl who took my little sister's order gave her some clam chowder to try, i guess. that was real nice of her. her and another guy who worked there was also friendly! i love it when the workers are pleasant!if i ever visit new york, again. i will gladly drop by for lunch or dinner or just a small small snack."
250,Alina P.,1114,4,10/4/18,the best clam chowder ever!!!the place is packeddo not forget to stop by for happy hour!
251,Calvin S.,1114,4,9/26/18,"believe it or not, the first place i tried luke's lobster was in japan. i loved it so much that i had to try this place in the birthplace of luke's lobster next time i was in nyc.which was just recently!it was quiet at am as they just opened, and also the place was cold. it was somewhat of a hot day, but not too overwhelming to the point where the a c needed to be blasted.i had the lobster roll with the clam chowder. the lobster roll was definitely amazing, even better than the one i had in japan. large chunks of lobster and the sauce was great too. the clam chowder was a bit diluted, yet salty at the same time. i would probably pass on this next time, at least for this branch. however, i came for the lobster roll, and the main event easily met my expectations, so it is a star for me.i did not get much in terms of service since you order from the counter and that was it. either way luke's definitely is a yes for me for lobster rolls in nyc."
252,Thadd J.,1114,4,9/23/18,"yet another great yelp find. after checking in at the hotel, i was looking for something to eat. luke's was only a couple of blocks away.i arrived late in the afternoon, so there were only a few people inside. it is a neat and clean place. the staff was friendly and helpful. since it was my first visit, i had a question or two. a somewhat small area with a few small tables along the wall and a couple of seats at the countertop looking outside the front of the place.you place your order towards the back from a small and easy to read menu. i had a cup of clam chowder and luke's trio. the trio allowed me to taste a slightly smaller version of each roll. the menu has only three types of rolls maine lobster, jonah crab, and north atlantic shrimp.all the rolls were delicious. they are not drenched in mayo and veggies. according to luke's menu, they rolls are a quarter pound of seafood, melted lemon butter, mayo very little, i barely tasted it or saw it , and their secret seasoning.the lobster was my favorite, it was pure lobster with just enough seasoning to help bring out the freshness of the lobster. the crab was light and sweet. the shrimp could have used a little more lemon to help cut the freshness of the shrimp. the atlantic shrimp are not as sweet and the fresh gulf shrimp that i'm used to in texas.the clam chowder was gratifying, it definitely holds its own against the other clam chowders i've had on the east coast.looking forward to going back the next time i'm in nyc."
253,Meg S.,1114,5,10/19/18,"a friend in louisville had written about this place on facebook awhile back so i took note and decided i had to go. there are several around and we went to the one on william st. it is a small friendly place. we looked at menu on the wall and i saw friend's recommendation. i asked the guy at the counter and he showed me a pick of luke's trio lobster roll, shrimp roll, and crab roll. my husband had the same. friends had the trio salad and clam chowder. she liked the salad, but he did not care for the chowder. my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our rolls. it was a costly lunch but probably average for new york. including tip for the of us. would definitely recommend and would return."
254,Annaleah J.,1114,5,10/24/18,"wish i would have discovered this place earlier during my week in nyc, i would have gone everyday! tried a lobster roll and a side of clam chowder. everything was delicious!! lobster meat was so good, paired with their warm buttery bread.so good! definitely recommend"
255,Tom F.,1114,5,10/24/18,"the lobster rolls may seem pricy for a chain like this, but they are divine. not too creamy, pretty simple. huge, sweet chunks of lobster exploding out of a buttery bun. yum."
256,Uyen L.,1114,5,9/3/18,"according to my very limited experience with other lobster rolls, this one was delicious because it was not smothered in mayo and other sauces. it was lightly seasoned so the lobster shined. i cannot wait to go back. sure, it is not cheap for what it is roll is the size of a hot dog bun , but if you get the slaw and chips, it rounds out the meal perfectly. to me, it was worth every penny because it was so fresh and tasty. the staff was very friendly and the place was clean. we went in around pm and it was dead so no problem with seating. the clam chowder is also very good. loved it and cannot wait to come back for more."
257,Vivian L.,1114,3,8/25/18,"luke is one of fidi's gem, i used to frequent this joint a few years ago more once every other month. this was before the prices increased for their famous lobster rolls. it is a really cool and casual spot you just order and sit at one of the tables.i think their lobster rolls are more fresh than any other places around here but the prices increased over the years and i cannot justify to the price i pay for smaller size of the lobster rolls. i stopped coming here."
258,Jungwon S.,1114,4,6/9/18,"fooduhhh, i mean it is good. i got a lobster roll and the lobster is amazing. very fresh. i did not expect to have this quality of lobster in nyc. it was also very impressive that without making it just too sweet or salty, it was perfectly seasoned.pricewelp. this is why it is not stars. i thought it was definitely overpriced even considering the fact that it is lobster and it is in nyc. i've had other lobster rolls of similar quality in the city and other places at a much, much lower price. i did not think there was anything too special about this particular roll that would compensate for the price.overalli would not go back for the roll. it is worth a try but not to go for regular basis."
259,Rhea D.,1114,5,11/5/18,"we had the trio half lobster, half crab and half shrimp roll and a cup of clam chowder.the crab roll is what we liked the best but the rest are quite good as well.it is a bit too small for my liking but it seems like everything in nyc is expensive anyway.nonetheless, it is well worth the price."
260,Kyle V.,1114,4,6/15/18,"lobster rolls are expensive, and these are lobster rolls in new york city. yes, you are going to pay a pretty penny to enjoy a quick meal. the best part of our meal was the clam chowder, which they brag about not even being theirs.the trio was a great way to try all rolls but you get a tiny portion and they all taste extremely similar. the lobster roll was my favorite of the but it still lacked true fresh flavor.just like anywhere else in the city, it is small cramped but we enjoyed our lunch."
261,Dennis L.,1114,5,5/21/18,the trio!! for this delicious thing. shrimp. crab. lobster. only half a hot dog each though. but still so good. butter drenched on it. there is siracha sauce and pepper for you to toss on it also for added flavor.this stuff is good. seriously it is good. just expensive. but a wonderful experience.it was really smoky inside though. not sure if the ventilation was working adequately but the delicious food makes up for the smoke.great food. so delicious. fresh.
262,Johnny S.,1114,4,10/20/18,"i had the large lobster roll, clam chowder and pumpkin beer. all very good. the hospitality was superior, the entire team was on it, knowledge of their menu and really made all the difference in my experience. i lived in san diego for years and travel to san fran., miami, seattle, la, and nyc multiple times a year for work, seafood by far is my thing, i would rank the lobster roll up there with my favorite joints in those cities for that particular dish. i would return no doubt, good seafood!"
263,Alvin D.,1114,5,10/28/18,great lobster roll! temperature difference on the meat and bun was right on. clean and simple on the flavor. definitely coming back when i hit fidi again.
264,Darek J.,1114,4,8/16/18,"i've been here a couple times and i love the lobster rolls here. they are much better than the one i had at lobster and burger. the bun was toasted just right and the sauce is fantastic. i would eat here more often if i could afford it!the only reason i give it stars is because the portions are quite small for the price you pay, and a lot of people on here are concerned about portion size.but hey it is lobster what do you expect."
265,Natalie C.,1114,3,7/22/18,"my friend and i dropped by luke's lobster after touring the statue of liberty, because luke's lobster was one of the higher rated restaurants around the area. we dropped by around pm on a thursday, so there was absolutely no line. the store was small but comfortable. upon entering the restaurant, the smell of butter and seafood filled the air. i had high expectations coming in.as the word lobster was in the name of the restaurant, we both grabbed a lobster roll. within a minute of ordering, the lobster roll was ready to serve. to my surprise, the dish came out way smaller than expected, though there definitely was huge chunks of lobster on it. the piece of carb surrounding the lobster was simply a buttered white toast folded in half to give perspective on how big the roll really is . keep in mind that the price of this was +tax, coming out to be around . . i understand that this is the financial district, and therefore food prices are going to sky rocket, but i honestly do not know if such a small roll is even worth the price since i was still hungry afterwards.on the bright side, the lobster was really sweet and fresh. i think they used just enough seasoning to add flavor to the lobster, while maintaining the lobster's natural flavor.luke's lobster is definitely a good place if you are hungry for a quick bite. just do not count on it for a full meal."
266,Taylor R.,1114,4,5/18/18,"as someone from the midwest, i do not have the chance to enjoy quality seafood often. this satisfied my lobster cravings!my only complaint is that i wish there had been more. i could easily have had five lobster rolls!also, huge shoutout to the staff. they were very helpful in accommodating me in such a tiny place."
267,Mich M.,1114,5,4/6/18,"just finished a shrimp roll, lobster tail, and pickle for lunch and i am craving for more. god, the food was so good! the shrimp roll was warm and buttery, definitely try it! the lobster tail was boiled and tasteless, so feel free to add your own condiments for flavor. they have salt, pepper, and sriracha hot sauce.i'm a pickle lover so the free pickle was definitely a bonus."
268,Tung Y.,1114,4,3/27/18,"at last. before one opens in toronto, i finally have a chance to try this out. ordered a takeout on a late tuesday evening close to closing at p. knowing that the rolls are not huge i ordered a lobster roll and half a crab roll with poppy seed slaw side and a lemon blueberry lemonade.the cashier treated me nicely and did not rush me even though it is about to close. other staff were nice too.by the time i got back to the hotel the rolls were already cold but that does not make it less delicious nor fishy. the chunks of lobster were hugged by the garlic butter infused roll. so good. so was the crab roll. very satisfying.it is expensive given the portion but the quality of the shellfish is there so i still think it is worth it.next time i will eat them at the restaurant and hopefully they will taste even better!"
269,Daniel A.,1114,2,11/1/18,"this place is overrated no flavor what so over! i've had way betterlobsterrollsfor a better price. it is literally bread andlobster. really add mayo, tarragon, some spices, maybe some bacon to make it taste good. and the clam chowder tasted funny! the prices are also a little to much for a tiny sandwich! never again!"
270,Ivy C.,1114,5,9/29/18,nice place! super freshlobsterrolland crabrollalso.definitely a must check if you are around
271,Nancy B.,1114,5,9/26/18,"my friend had read that luke's has the bestlobsterroll in nyc so when we were walking around the financial district we decided to check it out. granted, i'm from minnesota so my experience with freshlobsteris limited, but i have had otherlobsterrolls, including some in boston.i cannot say that luke's is the best in the city, but it is the best one i've ever had & luke's is on the list of places i must go when i'm in new york . better yet, open one at the mall of america it needs a place like luke's!

275,Stanley W.,1114,4,9/5/18,"ordered thelobstertrap and luke's triorolls. the triprollcomes with shrimp, crab, andlobster. all the seafood was fresh, but only thelobsterrollstood out among the pack.for thelobstertrap, thelobsterrollwas the best i've ever had. the lobstertail was fresh, but did not taste like much even with butter. the soup was alright.summary. get thelobsterrollonly stars everything else is just average stars "
276,Yifan D.,1114,2,9/1/18,"preordered the luke's favorite online and picked up in store, and very disappointed. . they forgot to give me chips. . thelobsterrollwas extremely salty.conclusion too salty, too expensive i got the double sizedlobsterrollin boston at about the same price , and the server is careless."
277,Stella H.,1114,5,8/31/18,thelobsterrollis awesome! crabrolland shrimprollsare tasty but thelobsterone is my favorite. definitely need to be tried.
278,Alex D.,1114,4,8/17/18,"lobsterroll i thought the serving size was pretty big. i got it delivered and had to eat it in two sittings. it was mainly claw meat. was pretty good, not overthetop extraordinary or anything. but the serving size was substantial.clam chowderget this. i like this way more than thelobsterroll.salt & vinegar cape cod chips do not get this. way too much vinegar. if you like drinking vinegar straight, you might like this.blueberry sodado not get this. tastes like nothing. it is basically water with a sprinkle of sugar and some bluish color. just get regular water."
279,Kenny Y.,1114,5,8/6/18,"this location is welldeserving of its high yelp rating. limited seating but if the weather's nice there are plenty of places to sit outside. we went here on a thursday night pm and there was no line and plenty of seats inside the restaurant. the food is as good as it gets we ordered the luke's trio which consists of acrabroll, shrimproll, and lobsterrollserved in half portions. highly, highly recommend because it gives you a little taste of everything on the menu without leaving you too full, all at a reasonable price . the bun is buttery and toasted perfectly crispy brown on the outside, and the seafood itself is sweet and flavorful. they do a really nice job of not overseasoning the seafood and they let natural flavors really shine through. in my opinion, one of the best spots to go to in the financial district."
280,E K.,1114,5,7/20/18,hands down the best lobsterrolli have ever had! i have had what i consider amazing lobsterrollsat chelsea market lobster place and in connecticut particularly new london but i really think luke's takes the cake for lobsterroll! incidentallybut i also think indicative of their philosophy and excellent service and foodi stumbled on them on a recent trip to philadelphia and branched out tocrabrollspecial of the day at the suggestion of the server and it was amazing as well. even if there is a line it moves fast thanks to friendly and efficient staff
281,Antonio S.,1114,2,7/13/18,"portions are tiny, waiting time is crazy long. i went in today and ordered acrabrolla small corn chowder and a glass of beer. it came to a total of . therollwas tiny and did not have much flavor. there was a fair amount ofcrabmeat but it really was not seasoned. the corn chowder was tasty but again the portion was tiny for . the beer was ok. i do not know if i will go back, not sure it is worth the price or massive waste of time."
282,Rachel L.,1114,4,7/3/18,the lobsterrollis a bit small for its price. myrollcame with the claw part so it was not that meaty.i actually like thecrabrollbetter. there was a lot ofcrabmeat and the price was not too bad. i also had their clam chowder which was pretty good.i will come again if i am craving seafood.
283,LaToya K.,1114,4,5/25/18,"i. love.their. lobster.rolls. luke's is my goto for lobsterrolls. not necessarily this location, but any of their locations. i came to the william street location for lunch during the week to get my fix. the place is small, but there was no wait for a table. this time i ordered the trio, a small lobsterroll, a smallcrabroll, and a small shrimproll. they are not super filling, but they are super tasty. i also had one of their blueberry lemonades. i think my favorite thing about the lobsterrollshere is that they are not heavy on the mayo. in fact i'm not sure there is any mayo at all, but there is that delicious butter. makes the lobster just melt in your mouth. writing this review is making me crave one right now."
284,C K.,1114,4,5/17/18,"the lobsterrollandcrabrollwere delish. shrimp was ok in my book . the staff was friendly and accommodating. however, they did say we could sit at a table in the alley. i'm sure they did not know, but when we tried to sit at the tables in the alley, we were not welcome per the wait staff of the restaurants there . a little obnoxious from the dubliner.there were many empty tables. anyway, therollsare great.get some now!"
285,Kate Z.,1114,5,5/9/18,one of the best lobsterrollsi've ever had. they do not skimp on the lobster chunks like some other places do. thecrabrollwas really good too. same with the chowders.
286,Natalia M.,1114,5,4/29/18,"been here or times, the food is so good i've always gotten the same thing. luke's trio which are smaller versions of the lobsterroll, shrimprollandcrabroll everything from the bread to the seafood is delicious. i always pair this with the poppyseed slaw which is also soooo good and i do not like slaw. my husband got luke's favorite which is the lobsterrolland two sides he got chips and slaw . honestly this place is very low key and we always enjoy coming here. i guess it could be said it is on the pricier side luke's trio is , but imo it falls in line with prices for this type of food. staff is friendly and pleasant."
287,Andrew C.,1114,4,3/13/18,"i love getting food here despite the fact it is a good min walk, plus like today when it was a mix of rain and snow i still came out and walked the trek of horrid hotness and sweating. stars because i nearly broke a tooth in thecrabrollbecause there was a dingdangdoodly she will in myroll, props otherwise"
288,Mengjia Y.,1114,5,3/8/18,"thecrabrolland the lobsterrollis excellent, especially thecrabroll. the lobsterrollis no as good as burger&lobster."
289,Chris H.,1114,5,1/23/18,"amazing beyond belief. coming from the south east, i doubted the quality. i was set straight at the first bite! amazing trio with thecrabrollbeing my personal favorite. had the bisque that was off the chart. i would fly back to nyc just to eat here!!!"
290,Phuong N.,1114,3,1/19/18,"we tried allrollshere lobster tails,crab& shrimprolls. they all tasted good, but the best one to me iscrabrolls. price is quite expensive for very smallrollsize. for + for lobsterroll, i expected the lobster quality to be great androllsize slightly bigger, but it is very small, much smaller than expected. they only makerollswith cold lobster meat, not warm or hot, so it took a bit getting used to. restaurant size is very small, just enough for people max to sit inside."
291,Catherine K.,1114,5,1/18/18,"luke's lobster is a great spot if you are looking for some fresh seafood. i am a huge lobster crab shrimp person so this place seems like my kind of heaven.when you walk in, the smell is amazing, the decor is so cute and nautical, and you feel like you are at the beach.i tried the lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese for dinner last night and it was amazing. i wish their portion sizes were a bit bigger, especially for the price we are paying i would say it is a bit pricey , but the lobster was fresh and both the mac and cheese and soup were just divine.i definitely will return to try theircraband lobster grilled cheeses, their lobsterrolls, andcrabrollsone of these days!"
292,Eugene D.,1114,4,1/15/18,"pretty good food. thecrabrolltasted fresh. we all ordered bowls and they were really good.pricey in my opinion, but i would each here again"
293,Grace N.,1114,4,12/13/17,"i read the reviews here saying that the sandwiches are too small for how much they cost but i did not take them too seriously my fault ! how small can they really be it costs dollars for a sandwich!when we got our order lobsterrolls, crabrolland lobster bisque i was amazed. yelpers were right they are very small and not so filling. they were amazingly good though. they are worth trying but if i was a local here i do not know if i would be able to afford such a small sandwich at a high price on a regular basis!"
294,Amanda L.,1114,5,7/27/18,great food.lobster was fresh. i highly recommend! had the lobster roll andclamchowderand both were amazing!!
295,Christian R.,1114,5,7/16/18,kind of pricey but pretty great. their special was a lobster roll with cape cod potato chips and a generous helping of cole slaw. the combination was delicious. i also loved theclamchowder.i took a couple of people who had never hadclamchowderand who are really picky eaters. they were hooked.
296,Archana W.,1114,4,6/10/18,"we had the likes trio and the shrimp on top of the blue salad along with a small serving ofclamchowder oh my god, where do i start ! the lobster was by far the best of the trio but all of it was amazing. theclamchowderwas delicious!! i was actually sad we did not get a bigger size. definitely understand the hype of this place because it was all so yummy. it is a little pricey, for everything including chips was about . but i think worth it. on a cold rainy day, thatclamchowderhits the spot, i will definitely go back to get thechowder!!"
297,Elvira K.,1114,4,5/22/18,very small portions!! cold seafood put on top of bread. hated the cold shrimp roll. loved the crab and lobster roll. bestclamchowder!!!!! yet the portion sizes are very small.
298,Vivian L.,1114,2,3/11/18,"while visiting ny from los angeles san diego ca , my friend and i decided to try this place based on the great reviews. i saw quite a few that were hesitant about the price but frankly, for a lobster roll is pretty typical so, undaunted by the pricing, we went in with high expectations and boy were we sadly disappointed. it was the tiniest and blandest lobster roll i have ever had. the description told of the lobster being flavored lemon butter and their secret seasoning , but i did not taste any lemon, butter, or seasoning. i could not even taste any of the natural sweetness lobster meat usually has. and i'm not sure if this is typical of east coast lobster rolls but instead of the thick, buttery, toasty bread i'm used to, it just seemed like a regular slice of bread that was slightly toasted and used to wrap the lobster. i also got theclamchowder, which was flavored nicely, but theclambits had the texture of having been frozen and thawed too many times. would not recommend this place nor would i want to come back for more."
299,Cristhian C.,1114,5,2/21/18,"came to luke's for a quick bite to eat before heading to see a movie. service was quick and the cashier was very helpful and courteous. not to mention the food was really delicious, especially theclamchowder. will definitely be coming back if i'm ever in the area"
300,Katharine W.,1114,5,4/27/18,greatlobsterrolls andlobsterbisque! the flavor of thelobsteris scrumptious and paired with a buttery not too thick roll makes eating this roll an amazing experience! will definitely visit this place again when in the financial district!
301,Lindsi G.,1114,4,4/24/18,"sought out alobsterlunch spot after getting off the staten island ferry ride.lobsterroll andlobsterbisquewere both great. staff was super friendly, too, and the place was pretty empty at pm on a tuesday. took off a star for the size to price disproportionality. i'm happy to pay for a solidlobsterroll, but this one could have been % bigger for the price. otherwise had a great experience!"

303,Emily C.,1114,5,2/16/18,"update my mistake was not going for thelobsterroll. thelobsterroll was amazing and perfectly seasoned. i'm a bigbisquefan and that is the reason why i went for thebisque. the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. legen wait for it dary.i had thelobsterbisque, and i've had better. i also order the alobstertail, and it was bland. there was no flavor, and after eating thelobsterbisque, it did not settle well. i'm drinking ginger ale hoping it helps my stomach. the service there was great, the people working there were friendly."
304,Christin W.,1114,5,1/31/18,"food is awesome. anthony and lisa were lovely. will definitely be going back or visiting another location soon. luke's trio was awesome partial to thelobsterroll, though the crab took a close second and thelobsterbisquewas perfect. good recommendations by the staff."
305,Yvon C.,1114,5,1/29/18,"love this place. totally impressed by the care of therinn and the head chef anthony. kind, warm and generous. and went above and beyond to take great care of my brother and i. my brother hates mayo and therinn customized thelobsterroll without mayo with no hassle and complaints. the food is off the hook too. had thelobstertail, two flannel dish and thelobsterbisqueis warm and fuzzy. warmed my heart."
306,David F.,1114,5,12/9/17,"wow. really, wow.i do not have a lot of experience withlobsterrolls, but given my experience at luke's i'm going to dive in to this world.i did not expect thelobsterto be cold in the roll but after a few bites it was clear that this is the way god intended it. an excellent butter salty seasoning of some kind soaked the thing it was excellent.i had a large bowl oflobsterbisqueas well also excellent with a nice chunk oflobstermeat in the bottom. they apparently buy the soup from some company in maine but i'm pretty sure they put the fresh crab in it.its more of a grab and go place a few places to sit but its not like a date place.excellent"
307,Vivian C.,1114,4,11/15/17,"small but scrumptiouslobsterand crab rolls!food orderedlobsterroll, the trio three half sandwiches of thelobsterroll, shrimp roll, and crab roll , andlobsterbisque. warm bread was deliciously buttered and grilled, which contrasted nicely with the cold, fresh, seasoned seafood filling. loved thelobsterroll and the crab roll the best over the shrimp roll would definitely get those two again and skip the shrimp roll. i love that their mayo spices dressing is light and let us the flavors of thelobsterand the crab be the stars of the rolls.lobsterbisquewas rich and perfect for a cold day definitely could taste thelobsterin it.drinks some fun lemonades and juices also by luke'slobster.space super cute and cozy with a beach shack by the sea theme. limited seating.service pleasant and professional!price this is where i knock off one star. for the price, they could give a little more sandwich, but they do pack the small rolls pretty full and the taste is fantastic, so will be coming back for mylobsterand crab roll cravings!"
308,lydia m.,1114,4,6/26/17,"goodlobster, crab, and shrimp roll! it is expensive for the a small portion of our food. it is still good to try. spent about for rolls andlobsterbisque."
309,Yuechen Y.,1114,4,5/28/17,"very delicious food! if you are a tourist traveling to new york and happen to be in the area near the statue of liberty or just a working professional near this restaurant, definitely come and check it out. the restaurant is very small can seat around ish people, but you can always have the food to go. i tried almost everything on the menu. i ordered a couple oflobsterrolls with thelobsterbisqueand the clam chowder at first, and then went back in line for some more rolls luke's trios lobsterroll, crab roll, shrimp roll my favorite rolls of all was thelobsterroll, and my parents' favorite roll was the crab rolls. the shrimp rolls were okay because the shrimps were pretty small. i prefer thelobsterbisqueto the clam chowder. thelobsterbisquewas flavorful and well seasoned.the only complain of this place is the waiting time and the portion. there were one person taking customers' orders and helping with food at the same time. besides that person, there were only two waiters preparing for the food. the wait time was around minutes for each order. the portion of everything is pretty small. i had to went back to order something more for my party because everyone was still hungry after onelobsterroll and the order of the soup. the total cost was about for about people."
310,Steve w.,1114,5,5/12/17,deliciouslobsterrolls! great place to walk to after observing the freedom towers. service was top notch. my wife wanted a large cup oflobsterbisqueafter the first order. the kind gentleman just gave to us for free and said enjoy! keep up the great service guys!

313,Frank Z.,1114,4,12/29/16,"upon checking in at the andaz wall street, my girlfriend and i decided that luke'slobsterwould be a sufficient choice for our first meal after arriving in nyc. we had previously triedlobsterrolls in toronto as well as seattle however, we were disappointed, and we wanted to give this establishment a chance to prove the magnificence of thelobsterroll. the pictures looked super amazing and it indeed did not disappoint. in fact, we were blown away by the amount oflobsterused and the flavor as well.given our reservation at le bernardin later in the evening, my girlfriend and i decided to share alobsterroll and alobsterbisque. thelobsterroll had a perfectly crispy and seasoned roll, and the lobsterthey use per roll was overflowingly delicious. it was refreshing and perfectly seasoned, and we both enjoyed it very much. thelobsterbisque, on the other hand, left some to be desired, as i believe seattle did a better job in that regard, at pike place chowder. thelobsterbisquehere was a bit on the grainy side, and the flavor was lacking. however, it made up for it by having large chunks oflobsterwithin, which tasted wonderful.the service was fast and helpful, but the environment was slightly cramped. it is a small establishment, but definitely worth a trip if you are in the area! overall, this place had the bestlobsterroll we have had and i look forward to returning even though they raised their prices .ambiance upon entering, the dining room is slightly cramped and had limited seating. however, it is nicely decorated.food thelobsterroll was amazing, but thelobsterbisqueleft more to be desired.service . even though it was not too busy when i went, the staff seemed inattentive and i needed to get their attention after waiting at the register for a couple of minutes.overall .

314,Anna S.,1114,3,12/4/16,"restaurant looks like very tacky with selfservice.we gotlobsterbisque, clam showder,lobstertail and crab clams.soup packages were dirty. it was looks like someone took it with hands stained of showder. not very pleasant impression. but both of showder were very tasty and hot.lobstertail and crab clams were too small for portion and very cold. very cold. like from a fridge. and taste was like it was cooked like yesterday.we were very disappointed. because all of these staff cost ."
315,Kelly N.,1114,4,11/26/16,"really small place with a seating for probably no more than people. orderedlobsterrolls, shrimp roll, crab claws andlobsterbisque.lobsterroll was probably one of the best i have tasted. did not have too much mayo and a good amount oflobster. portions were the same sized as most otherlobsterrolls i had. shrimp roll was not very good. there were not a lot of flavors and shrimps were small. crab claws were small also.lobsterbisquewas just what i needed on a cold day. it was hearty and had good amount of chunky pieces oflobster."
316,Aliyah E.,1114,3,6/9/16,"my star rating is leaning mainly on the cost of thelobsterroll, cape cod chips, thelobsterbisqueand crackers that was all . oh! and let us not forget the of the pickle! and the fact that the food was not entirely filling yes, gluttony is real! .thelobsterroll was tasty and i love that when i bit into it i could taste solely thelobsterand a hint of butter and seasoning. i have to say that i was sad to see it go once i had the fourth and final bite.luke'slobsteris good if you have either already eaten and or just have a craving for shrimp, crab orlobsterrolls. do not plan on getting filled up onlobster, unless you have deep pockets! this place i highly recommend for appeasing your seafood craving or getting a tasty lunch."

318,Tony D.,1114,5,11/30/17,"when it comes to lobster rolls,luke'sare the best. the lobster is fresh and the roll is simple, so the flavor of the lobster really shines through. i've tried the crab and shrimp rolls as well. all are good, but the shrimp was my least favorite. the portions are not that large, so you will need to either order more than roll or something else to go with it. i went with theluke'strio."
319,Karen K.,1114,1,11/2/17,"a bit disappointed. looks are definitely deceiving. the reviews on here are old & the menu has changed. i had theluke'striowhich includes of all three crab, shrimp, lobster. do not waste your money. they are small & i found the crab meat to be super salty, the lobster roll was tasteless not like your normal lobster roll. before they atriothat included all three with a drink, side of chips and or pickle which costed more but i'm assuming worth it. before . now . honestly the best part or the rolls was the buttery toasted buns. my coworker had a cold drink that is was pretty gross in her words. they do have a lobster mac & cheese that i wanted to try but after today's experience i might just take that thought back!"

322,Lillian C.,1114,5,6/13/17,"this was my first time trying the lobster roll and it did not disappoint! there was a good helping of wellseasoned lobster on it and even the bun was flavorful. you can get a card stamped everytime you order a lobster roll,luke'strio, or tail salad. after the th stamp, you get one for free! i would recommend coming here if you are in the financial district and want a quick bite to eat."
323,Rachel L.,1114,4,1/9/17,"came here for lunch on a rainy weekday and the place was only halffilled. perhaps it was the rain that deterred the crowd, or because we had a late lunch around . pm. the menu is fairly simple there are only three rolls to choose from lobster crab shrimp or you can opt for theluke'striowhere you get each of the lobster, crab and shrimp rolls. you can also add sides to a roll for . we each had a lobster roll and shared the slaw and chips. the first time i triedluke'slobster was at the theater district and i thought it was just ok. i have a better impression of the lobster rolls at this fidi location. the bun was buttered and toasted perfectly, there was a generous amount of fresh lobster and there was just the right amount of seasoning on the lobster. however, i would say skip the combo and just have the lobster roll, then go elsewhere for desserts "

327,Stella S.,1115,5,11/7/18,"no wait on a wednesday night! this was the perfect quick dinner after a broadway show. we were starving after watching the book of mormon and decided to try totto ramen. there was table ahead of us, but the host seated us within mins of getting there. i was surprised the restaurant was so small for a place with so many reviews. it felt authentic. if you sit at the bar, you can see the chefs making the ramen.our host recommended the spicy miso paitan with bamboo shoots. i ordered this and my friend ordered the original paitan with egg.spicy miso paitan the broth was really thick and flavorful which was nice on a cold day. i love the chili sauce they put in this. this really hit the spot. i am giving this stars because the broth was too much at the end so i was not able to finish my ramen. typically, the soup is my favorite part, but it was just too thick for me to finish it.original paitan the broth was nice and rich, and surprisingly not too salty. the green onions tasted super fresh. the broth was such a nice contrast to the spicy miso paitan. we finished pretty much all the broth because it was so tasty!next time i would definitely get these again, but order the spicy miso paitan to share then get the original ramen to share to finish off the meal."
328,Annie L.,1115,4,11/1/18,"went here around pm and there was a line out the door but the wait was not very long.i ordered the spicy miso paitan with pork and my brother got the spicy paitan with chicken. both were delicious. the broth has a very bold chicken flavor and mine was a little extra oily from the spicy oil which i do like. so if you are not a fan of heavy broths, do not order what we did for it is a very particular flavor.i loved how they cooked their charsui pork. it was tender and juicy, which went perfect with the al dente noodles. perfect fall winter meal."
329,connie c.,1115,4,10/29/18,spicy paitan with char siu and egg the broth is creamy but not too heavy compared to the tonkatsu . noodle textures are perfect. the only thing i did not love was the char siu. i feel like their original location makes it just a little better.cash only!
330,Ivy C.,1115,3,10/24/18,"i love the authentic feel of this tiny, bustling ramen shop bar seating next to the open kitchen with rolling vats of ramen broth, fresh noodles, and japanese staff. but despite its popularity and the thousands of star reviews, we were pretty disappointed in the food. i wanted to love it so badly, darn it. it was our last meal in ny.i always hoped this would be better than ippudo or the best we have in ca. so i set up my own ramen taste test to try ippudo, totto the two most reviewed + star ramen restaurants and one . star, lesser known restaurant in this case, zundoya .when ordering ramen for the first time, i always default to the restaurant's top selling dish to use as a benchmark.ippudo had a creamy, flavorful broth with meltinyourmouth pork. their pork buns look more sad now but the pork is still cooked to perfection.zundoya was a very close second. i love the bigger portion, ability to customize level of broth fat and type of noodle curly was great , and how it comes with all toppings for a flat price if you choose their signature ramen.cherry on top, with the wait time, zundoya would easily suffice over ippudo any day. this place deserves more yelp cred!totto sorry but you were so far behind. thinner broth, large, but tough piece of pork, larger, but less flavorful pork bun. shoot less flavorful all around! also cash only.one huge plus though vegetarians and carb cutters will love this place. you can sub cabbage in for noodles for . and the vegetarian broth was surprisingly flavorful and fulfilling packed with mushroom, vegetables, avocado, etc for . i tried that in addition to their signature bowl out of curiosity and i'm glad i did!all in all though, if you are looking for a rich, creamy broth, this is not your place. with new ramen shops popping up everywhere in ny, i would check out a lesser known place with . stars first."
331,Audrey K.,1115,4,10/15/18,"first off, i'm not usually one to like ramen or initiate a trip to ramen bars parlors. but it seemed like a must eat while visiting. we came across this one walking distance between our place of stay and timesquare .it did not take long for us to get seated at about pm on a weekday. cash only ordered with the waitress up front before being seated. i like how they had chicken broth as their ramen base and chicken meat. we sat up front at the booth, so we were able to watch as the chef made the bowls. it was quicker than i expected! in to eat and out was quick. the quality was really good and the noodles were not thin and soft. they were altendte and chewy. just the way i like it. i even drank the broth and i'm definitely not a soup consumer, but it tasted so good."
332,Linda W.,1115,4,10/20/18,we were walking around our hotel looking for a place to eat and this was close by.lines were long but ramen was excellent.mega ramen broth was tasty & creamy and there was so much meat!!must have been a little salty though bc i woke up in the middle of the night chugging down water 
333,Jason C.,1115,5,10/6/18,"the sides shine more than the ramen here! this is one of the few ramen bars in nyc that oozes an authentic japanese basement ramen shop vibe. too bad you have to tip and your do not pay a vending machine.i had the spicy bang bang boiled chicken as a side, i did not have high expectations for it, but it was amazing. it was zesty and the chicken had texture but was not rubbery. the crunchy bean sprouts complemented the chicken well.the chicken paitan based broth did not have a very strong taste to it. there was a lil bit of umami, but not that intense. it was good, but i expected more. there is better chicken paitan broth in nyc. noodles, pork belly and the pulled pork was top notch. the cabbage and garlic were nice touches. overall excellent taste and textures. if you have been here in the past, the mega paitan ramen, the price went up a lil bit and you only get half an egg now.lines can be long, but not as bad as some of the other popular from japan chains in manhattan. they are efficient by taking your orders ahead of time."
334,Valerie C.,1115,5,10/8/18,"sorry ippudo, i've been converted. totto is my new favorite ramen joint in manhattan.we started with the pork buns. it is was solid, a little heavier in taste because of the mayo but i did not mind.for ramens, i can only speak for one ramen that i tried here, the extra spicy miso paitan ramen. it is freaking amazing!!! the soup base was so flavorful but not overwhelming, and the noodles were perfectly cooked, chewy and al dante. the consistency of the soup was pretty thick and grabbed onto the noodles well. i would say the portion is pretty generous as well. i opted for the chicken char siu to stick with the whole chicken theme. compared to my friend's pork char siu, the chicken char siu was definitely drier, but i thought it was still tender enough. in the future tho, i would want pork char siu instead.great ramen, authentic ramen joint vibe, and cannot wait to go back to have more bowls!!!!"
335,Sharon L.,1115,4,10/13/18,"this resto is very small. no material what time you go, it is always busy and there is a waiting line.we waited for minutes. the host take your order while you wait out side for a sit to free up. very efficient, so you basically get your food is ready when you get a table.service was great, everyone was friendly. food was amazing! the ramen was perfectly cooked, even the soft boil egg was done perfectly.my chicken ramen was so good. the broth was not too salty, but my chicken was a little dry. my husband took the spicy pork ramen, and it was delicious as well. the spiciness was not too overwhelming, the pork was cook to perfection but the broth was a little bit salty due to the miso broth.the quantity was to the point.it was not too much or too little.we would go back again. it was worth the minutes wait."
336,Evelyn A.,1115,4,9/17/18,"the staff here is quite pushy, but i do not think they really have a get around. they need to get people in, eating and out as fast as possible. i've never not seen a line here, with good reason.the peppery goodness of their spicy ramen is insanely good, and it is my husband's go to. i prefer a more basic ramen, pork broth, add an egg. i do not know anyone who prefers chicken to pork, but if anywhere would master that broth, too, it is totto."
337,Karen F.,1115,4,9/17/18,"cash only! remember to bring cash!totto ramen is in a very interesting location, as it is in a basement of a building. the place is tiny with limited seating, but they make it very efficient by asking you to place your order before getting seated. although they close at pm, they stop taking parties after pm so do not try to make it here anytime after.it was nice to be seated at the counter while you salivate away and watch the chef work wonders. every time they make a new bowl, you start to wonder if it is yours.totto ramen's soup is chicken based broth. for my visit, i went with the most popular ramen, the mega paitan. although it was good, i thought it had too much meat that it became distracting. i love protein as much as the next person, but it was too much. for my next visit, i would probably go with the regular spicy paitan with extra noodles.definitely something different to try. i recommend coming in small parties and during off hours."
338,Claire L.,1115,5,10/24/18,"with nearly , reviews, i'm not sure there is anything i can say about totto ramen that has not already been said. totto ramen proves that sometimes the simplest, most honest ingredients, combined together, can create something incredibly unforgettable.i was in new york for a networking event, and my extended family decided to stay in new york for a night and have dinner together before coming up to new haven to visit me at my college. my mom chose totto ramen she and my dad drove to pick me up from my event at park and east rd. their hotel was close to totto ramen, so my grandparents waited for us at totto. the westward traffic was insane, and it took over minutes for us to drive to totto ramen at th and nd, so they ended up waiting for us for nearly half an hour. nonetheless, the waitstaff treated my elderly grandparents with great respect even though they were taking up bar space on a busy weeknight it was totally my fault new york traffic's fault for being late, sorry to other patrons! without buying anything and made them feel very welcome. it was both of their first times in new york and they were overwhelmed by the crowds and noise, but the waitstaff at totto ramen made them feel at ease. while i'm sure many establishments would have not hesitated to make them stand at the doorway because they were not paying customers at that point, the staff were patient and let them wait for us.now, onto the food i ordered the spicy paitan with pork, and it was outstanding. i asked for extra spice, and the mound of chili they served with my ramen did not disappoint. the broth rich, creamy, clinging onto the noodles so that every bite was savory, completely encapsulated the umami flavor profile. noodles were a bit thicker than normal ramen noodles, which allowed them to have a satisfying mouthfeel.terrific ramen, good vibes, but even better service you will not regret coming to totto ramen."
339,Khoa N.,1115,5,9/28/18,"definitely one of best bowls of noodles i have ever eaten. i have tried the spicy paitan, extra spicy miso, the spicy bonito, as well as the tsukemen. everything was delicious. flavorful broth, thick savory pieces of cha sui, and perfectly chewy noodles.they do have good days and bad days but overall it is mostly delicious. today was one of the best days. i savored every bite and spoonful of my spicy miso ramen. it was perfection. a solid ."
340,Sai A.,1115,5,11/8/18,"this place gives a very authentic vibe. people are talking in japanese,aa, the food is made in front of you, and bar seating. it is the perfect palace for ramen,aa and feels like a hidden gem. worth the visit, and will come back when visiting the area."
341,Shannon Z.,1115,5,9/13/18,"totto ramen is a super small ramen place with no ac when i came but it has got to be one of the most popular ramen places in new york. my friends and i came to totto in need of some delicious ramen and soup and i heard about this place through many youtubers and food bloggers.totto ramen i did not know is actually known for their chicken based ramen which my friends and i were skeptical about and wanted the regular tonkatsu ramen. they have a shop next door which sells that but when we went there, it was already closed. so in the end, we opted to try their chicken based ramen.i ordered their extra spicy paitan with pork char siu. they gave their spice on the side so you can add as much spice as you want to your soup. it definitely gave an extra kick to the ramen but it was definitely not spicy . when i got the ramen, i was really hungry and really excited to try.and i really liked it. the soup was thick so it grabbed on to the noodles really well. it flavored the noodles in every bite so i felt like it was extremely tasty. i'm still dreaming about the taste of the ramen as we speak. this is probably one of the top ramen bowsl i had ever had and it was a chicken flavored broth!definitely a must try place when you are in the area! i'm from la where there is a bunch of really really good and famous ramen places where the price is definitely cheaper than totto. totto, in my opinion, is definitely more pricey than what i'm used to but that is new york for you."
342,Matthew C.,1115,4,10/19/18," . month october day and time sunday afternoonfood starswe ordered the spicy paitan and the mega paitan. the regularlysized dishes such as the spicy paitan come with char siu only, but the mega comes with pulled char siu and pork belly. these cuts were full of flavor and i highly recommend you order the larger bowl. the char siu was bland. the mega paitan broth was rich and thick, with an undercurrent of garlic. the spicy chicken broth was thinner but just as tasty. the hotness was just right.setting & atmosphere starsthe restaurant is small but cosy half the restaurant sits at person tables, with the remainder at the bar. the cooks prepare the food right in front of the latter group, providing theater to the eating experience.drink n aservice starswe were seated and waited on quickly. we watched the bowls prepared before us and we were served in short order by the cooks directly.value starsthe standard bowls are , typical for the city. the mega paitan costs and easily keeps two people happy. note however, the restaurant requires a minimum of one item per customer.return yesthe broth is great, and that means the ramen is great. guaranteed great ramen is hard to find."
343,Ally R.,1115,4,9/15/18,"finally went to totto ramen this evening, and yes, it is worth the hype. as others have mentioned, this location specializes in paitan chicken broth which is a creamy with a rich chicken flavor. totto ramen next door has tonkotsu and veggie broth.we arrived at pm and waited minutes to be seated. they have an efficient process where they take your order before you sit down so it is ready when you are seated.note totto ramen is grade pending. we only realized this after waiting minutes. i hope they get an a rating soon.ordered chicken bun . this bun came with two pieces of char siu chicken, iceberg lettuce, mayo and teriyaki. it was pretty good.chicken paitan ramen the broth was killer good. it has chopped pieces of chicken in it. the noodles were prepared al dente and had chopped onions, scallions, and nori on top. you can choose between chat siu chicken or pork.miso paitan ramen this broth was the same as the other but has a dollop of miso paste with ground pork on top. it was served with chopped onions, scallions, bean sprouts and a half hard boiled egg. you can choose between chat siu chicken or pork.if you are in the mood for chicken broth ramen in midtown west and do not mind a wait, head over to totto ramen."
344,Ran W.,1115,3,10/23/18,my chicken paitan was yummy but my boyfriend got the pork ramen and it was drenched in pepper. we think it was an accident because i had some and there was no taste except for the pepper. cash only.
345,Chris T.,1115,4,9/10/18,super small venue where you are sharing a table or the bar with strangers who have come in with you. overall the flavors of the broth were good but my bowl in particular was wayyy to peppered. i cannot remember the name but as i was eating the bowl i was literally drinking half a cup of water with every gulp of the soup because of how much black pepper was in the broth was not spicy just super peppery . totto still gets stars because my partners bowl was apparently on point and she would not change a thing about it so maybe i just chose the wrong dish. she had the chef special.the staff was very quick and efficient not exactly super hospitable and the wait even at around pm was not super bad at about mins.
346,Jenny C.,1115,5,10/19/18,ramen on a chilly day will always be the best. but coming in the summer is good too. they did not have ac so it was kind of warm with mosquitos buzzing about and sucking our blood t_t .but i have and will always love totto's ramen. miso ramen all the way!
347,Christina W.,1115,4,8/21/18,i came here today with my friends for a quick lunch. it was not packed even though it was a tuesday afternoon. we ordered miso paitan and spicy paitan. the noodles were pretty chewy. my friend also ordered acharsiuporkbunwhich in my opinion was the best. the workers there are very affectionate. they kept coming over asking us if we wanted any drinks from the fridge or for a refill on water.
348,Maria H.,1115,5,8/18/18,"this is probably my favorite ramen place in town! we got twocharsiuporkbunsand mega paitan ramen best seller! . theporkbunwas amazing. i would say it is one of my favorite dishes. highly recommended. the ramen was also really good, huge portion with rich soup!!!!!! great service too."
349,Kelly S.,1115,5,3/7/18,"this place is amazing! it is fairly small which is nice and it looks like a place you can go all the time however you would have to wait to be seated which i did not mind much. i heard about this place from my friend and she hyped it up so much that i actually had to see it for myself. i definitely lived up to it.the dish i ordered was the spicy paitan andcharsiuporkbun. theporkbunwas so good, i honestly cannot emphasize it enough. the spicy paitan was splendid as well.the staff was also very welcoming and kind. they were checking in how was the food and attentive. while we were waiting, the waitress let us order before hand so by the time we were sitting, we would have our food ready. you would also have to only pay in cash.overall, i loved it and i most definitely come back again."
350,Megan W.,1115,4,1/11/18,"although the prices seem relatively high ~ for a smaller sized bowl of ramen, the broth is very thick and filling. i ordered the extra spicy paitan withpork, but got the spice on the side. the dish was very fragrant and flavorful, but i would recommend getting the spice on the side because it can be very spicy. next time, i would request a smaller amount of green onions next time, since the amount was overwhelming.thecharsiuporkbunwas extremely juicy and soft, and the flavor was very sweet. i would refrain from this dish if you are not a fan of oily greasy foods. i personally thought that the amount of mayonnaise was slightly overwhelming. at the price of . for and . for , i do not see myself ordering this often.as a small ramen shop, totto ramen is relatively busy, even right before close. however, the workers are very friendly and do their best to accommodate your party in a timely manner. my party of four was given a thirty minute wait time, but we were seated and served within the next fifteen minutes!"
351,Shawn C.,1115,5,1/4/18,"wow! amazing! the bar for ramen and service! if you are still reading this and not getting down to totto ramen, you need to leave now. go!many of the reviews talk about the line to get in and even with the snow storm, there was a wait. while waiting on the stairs to go down in the restaurant, the host was super friendly and kind. cute voice and situationally award of everyone waiting. working from a list that you put your name on, she hand out menus to the next names as she gets people into the restaurant and seated. the menu is very straight forward with photos, descriptions, and prices. she is quickly back and takes our order party of two]. you can sit at the bar, which i recommend for first timers, or wait a little longer for a table.the place is small or maybe tiny is a better word, but new york big for most restaurantslol. once seated at the bar we could see our food being made. thecharsiuporkbunwas killer! get it! get two and  wouldo not' share!! it is that good. the service is fast and super friendly. right after theporkhun was finished out ramen was being served.all i can say is, this is the bar of ramen in my opinion. it was well balanced, flavorful and hit on all the senses. noodles had great flavor, broth was hearty and the entire dish felt tasted super fresh. the price for what your getting was right on point for us.get to totto ramen today!!"
352,Mary H.,1115,5,1/1/18,"we stood in line for quite a bit for this place but everyone we spoke to in line said it was worth the wait. well, i ditto that. this place is the og, great selection, flavorful broth, delicious food. i've never eaten ramen this good. i highly recommend this place when visiting nyc. the ramen is fresh, large chunks of meat and vegetables, packed with flavor. thecharsiuporkbunis amazing and also a must try! you can share a mega ramen bowl and order a side and it is plenty and satisfying. enjoy!"
353,Chris M.,1115,5,11/28/17,"this is the way to eat ramen. sure there are a million ramen spots in nyc, but this place truly made me feel like i was in japan. it is a cozy underground hole in the wall with from what i could tell a fully japanese staff. went on a late weekend evening and barely had to wait for seats at the bar. i would not have chosen anywhere else to sit. we got to watch the masters prepare their creations while speaking to one another in japanese. the spicy paitan was wonderful, but i'm tempted to say thecharsiuporkbunwas the star of the meal. the meat was so juicy and thebunso soft. hands down one of my favorite ramen shops in the you.s."
354,Priscilla R.,1115,1,11/26/17,"s t a y a w a y!!! i'm not sure how this place has stars the music is horrible every other word is an f bomb. i ordered thecharsiuporkbunand it was filled with fat notpork. lastly, the waitress chica came back after we had tip her to say that we needed to leave more. what a joke!!!!!"
355,Kevin L.,1115,4,10/23/17,"one of the many delicious ramen spots in nyc. both the appetizers and entree i ordered were tasty. the chaisiuporkbunwas juicy and braised very well. for the ramen i ordered, i got the mega paitan, which was a little of everything in my ramen bowl. everything was tasty from the broth to the meats. a little fatty in content, but nothing too much to complain about. the place has a whole in the wall feel, so space is limited and you might have to wait for a table on weekends. but for me it was definitely worth it."
356,Jacqueline V.,1115,5,9/19/17,"when you think of hole in the wall. it really is hidden but this restaurant is definitely a gem. we came early and put our name of the waiting list. we sat at the bar not an alcoholic bar but it faced the ramen chefs and we watched curiously as they made all of the dishes. our ramen was amazing. spicy paitan with chicken and the miso paitan and also tried thecharsiuporkbun. everything is delicious!!! thebunwas amazing, possibly the best i've ever had. the soups were similar and when delivered there was a glob of spicy paste on top that you have to stir to mix in. we did not add toppings but you have the option to. our service was great. it is cash only. a complaint is that it is sooooo hot. sitting near the food being made was warm enough, but then adding spicy soup & the doors were kept open. it was hot and we were sweating. but it was so worth it. we were adamant about trying the original one and we are so glad we did! we did not have a long wait since we came early and put our name down. limited seating in the restaurant so they will stack you based on how many people are in your party. would not recommend going here in a large group. but highly recommend this restaurant!"
357,Kevin B.,1115,5,7/16/17,"i do not think i've reviewed totto ramen before. i've been here so many times in the past years. i always stop by whenever i am in new york. the place is always packed every time i go, wait could range from minutes to an hour. but it is always been worth the wait. i just wish they have a shaded waiting area, because it sucked when we were waiting outside and it rained. i always order thecharsiuporkbunand any of their spicy ramen. only thing you are missing to complete the experience is sapporo. try it!"
358,Lynn W.,1115,3,6/7/17,"service was great. that is also why i think they deserved good rating.we went in a party of . it was weekday at p. wait was minutes for at the bar. the host had said it would be a minutes wait.caution it is cash only.i am critical of good noodle. there are varies types ramen, udon, soba, hand pulled, spaghetti, etc.this ramen tasted fresh but not made at the location. noodle made at location has a more moist texture. i think their focus is broth. miso broth in miso paitan was too thick. their speciality dish mega paitan is too pricy. their chicken paitan broth was regular. their side itemcharsiuporkbunwas a bit salty.environment is not for kids. it is for grown ups that appreciate music of all types including expressive language.bathroom is extremely tiny and the last table sitting so close to the bathroom door made the environment seem unhealthy for dining for those people.i am glad i tried it once. i probably will not really go again because of the crowd and tiny space."
359,Sarah F.,1115,4,5/23/17,"toto ramen lived up to the hype! i had a minute wait on saturday afternoon and my order was taken while waiting outside. i would highly recommend thecharsiuporkbun. it is sweet,salty, fatty and delicious and by far my favourite think i ate all weekend. i also ordered the mega chicken paitan and it was definitely enough for two people. overall it was delicious, the chicken broth tastes very different from all other ramen experiences i have had but i really liked it. i would say the only downside is that you feel rushed just embrace the speed and size of the place! and keep in mind that it is cash only."
360,Cathy K.,1115,4,4/27/17,"finally got to try this famous ramen place. we arrived around on a weekday and waited about min.we ordered thecharsiuporkbunand megaporkramen. theporkbunwas unimpressive to me but thecharsiuwas flavorful and tender. the mayo in thebunwas a nice touch.the ramen was delicious and the egg was perfect. the wavy noodles were cooked just right. i did not like how much garlic there was though. there was garlic puree and fried garlic bits. it was too much for me but some people may love that.about halfway through my bowl, the ramen started tasting very heavy and salty. the soup felt almost too thick to drink. the cabbage helped a bit.cash only."
361,Rucha D.,1115,5,4/14/17,"it is your classic take on authentic japanese ramen in a very small shop, which is on par with walking into a ramen bar in japan. wait staff is incredibly attentive they take your name and order before you are seated during busy times which is quite often, being how tiny this place is . you are greeted when you enter and when you are about to exit.my friend and i shared thecharsiuporkbuns delish and served with heapings of theporkbelly, but i like momofuku's better in composition for ourselves, we ordered spicy paitan broth was flavorful and the vegetables fresh the spicy chili oil topping mixed in well with the flavors already in the paitan for an overall great bowl the special i think their mega paitan come here if you are a true ramen enthusiast and you will not be disappointed!"
362,K. D.,1115,5,3/21/17," stars for totto ramen. the wait was only minutes for a party of on a friday at pm. we tried the chicken paitan a little bland but still delicious , the miso paitan my favoirte! , and the mega paitan my dining companion's favorite . basically, you could not go wrong.we also had thecharsiuporkbunsand they were delicious. we will be back."
363,Amy P.,1115,3,3/15/17,"be prepared to wait! i did not think totto ramen would be too crowded since it was a thursday evening but i was wrong. the cold weather definitely brought everyone in! we waited approximately minutes for a table for four the host took our order while we were waiting so the food would arrive quicker.charsiuporkbun for . steamedbunfilled with two slices ofcharsiutopped with lettuce, mayo, and teriyaki sauce. definitely enjoyed thebunin general but there was not enough lettuce and an obscene amount of mayo and teriyaki sauce for a smallbun.spicy paitan choice ofporkor chicken with house made broth filled with sesame oil, bean sprouts, nori, and scallions. honestly, nothing about the bowl wow would me or anyone else in our party. basic ramen you can get anywhere else, just at a steeper price here.not to be confused with totto ramen next door. i was extremely confused initially but the staff member explained their broth wasporkbased while the original totto ramen served chicken based broth.cash only! minimum one order per person."
364,Kohei I.,1115,5,2/7/17,"totto ramen is the best ramen restaurant in nyc. my favorite is chicken paitan.charsiuporkbunis another must item to try. noted that they do not accept credit card, cash only."
365,Eva C.,1115,5,1/8/17,"food one word, scrumptious! i ordered the spicy paitan with chicken as well ascharsiuporkbuns. i must say, i was quite impressed! because i sat at the high table, i was able to sneak a peak at the chefs as they quickly worked their magic and prepared the food. the flavor of broths usually make it or break it for me, so i took my first sip of the broth and.i was sold!! it was very flavorful and rich what else can i say but that it was on point especially with its milky texture initially, i thought the chicken appeared a bit dry but turns out that i was wrong. i took my bite and it was actually really delicious and juicy. as for thebuns, it was also tasty! i might have appreciated it a bit more if i did not finish my ramen first because i was a bit too bloated. the meat was geared towards the fatty side, which makes it the more delicious. i also enjoyed how the sauce was not too overwhelming but just right.service i put my name down for a table of two and thought the wait would take at least an hour since the small restaurant was packed with people and the waiting area was all filled. i was wrong. my friend and i came back after half an hour from our apartment and everyone who was waiting was already seated. there was already a whole new pack of customers waiting to be seated. we missed it when the waiter had called us but luckily we were not called too far ahead so they were still willing to seat us when we came back. the wait for our food was honestly nonexistent. it arrived super quick within minutes. the thing is, you must eat quick because the waiters are waiting to take away your finished bowls immediately after you are done in order to seat other customers. i guess this is why the line moves on rather quickly.by the way, cash only!!"
366,Kim Y.,1115,3,1/2/17,"cash only, decent ramen, averageporkbun, terrible lines and even worst seatingsmy sister is an avid ramen fan and has been on the hunt for the best ramen in new york city. needless to say, she had to come to totto ramen. we waited about one hour to hour for lunch in the rain.tip there is a sign in sheet. put your name down and then resume your place in line. the waitress will come out and call your name when they are ready to take your order. you will have to place your order about to minutes before they seat you. once you were seating, your meal will be brought to you within minutes you sit down.charsiuporkbun they were your averageporkbun. softbun, good braisedporkbelly with teriyaki sauce and mayo. it was nothing noteworthy.mega paitan original wavy noodles with three types ofporkcharsiupork, pulledcharsiupork, andporkbelly chunks. the broth was good, less salty than many other ramen broths i have had. but, it felt very heavy and chunky towards the middle of my meal. my sister who normally drinks the entire bowl could not bare to finish her soup. the raw onions in the ramen were distasteful and quite much. however, i did really enjoyed theporkbelly chunks, which were perfectly braised and packed full of flavor. warning i could not finish my bowl of noodles. i finish all the noodles and left one piece ofcharsiu, some pulledcharsiu, and half the bowl of broth. i had this bowl of noodles for lunch at pm and was still full at pm.service we placed our names ahead of groups, but the waitress mixed up the order and did not seat us until we asked if we would be seated next. when we were able to sit down, we were placed on a small twoseater table we had three people in our party next to another two seater table. my sister was sitting in the aisle to the bathroom and the waitresses and customers repeatedly passed by. the party next to us also finish earlier and we had to get up twice from our seats to let the old party of leave and a new party of enter for their seats. needless to say, we were very uncomfortable in our seats. other than that, they were very friendly, but do not expect any service. you just eat your bowl of noodles and get out!after this experience, i probably would not be returning. i would try the east side location, which tends to have no lines and probably a more comfortable seating."
367,Jess S.,1115,5,10/28/18,"i had the spicychickenpaitan. mushrooms added. and a sapporo. excellent flavors and portion size. i went solo around p on a sunday and was able to get in immediately at the bar. you write your name and partysize on a list outside the entrance. very tiny, cozy spot. the lines and wait are so long because of this and the popularity i suspect. the hostess and my waitress checked on me for a total of times, the perfect amount in my mind. cash only, great price points. check it out!"
368,KC W.,1115,4,9/23/18,"important things to note cash only, and this location only serveschickenpaitanramen. for tonkatsu and miso broths, go to totto ramen next door my friends and i did not know this before we arrived, but next door was already closed by the time we realized there was a difference in the menu. thankfully, totto ramen did not disappoint!i had thechickenpaitanwith pork chasiu, while my friends ordered the spicy version. in the past when i've triedchickenramen, i've been unimpressed because it was so creamy and heavy, but totto's was light and flavorful. the noodles were a good chewy consistency and the chasiu was thick and fatty. i wish that the original came with bamboo and an egg because those are some of my ramen essentials, but otherwise it was delicious.my biggest complaint is just that there was no ac in the small cramped restaurant, but if we were hot sitting there, i can only imagine how hot it was in front of the stove. aside from that, totto ramen was delicious and i would definitely come back to satisfy mychickenramen cravings."
369,Connie T.,1115,4,9/2/18,"cash only!they did not tell us until after we ordered, so i'm not certain if they tell you ahead of time.came here after seeing the puffs at new world stages, so we just ended up wandering over here.they havechickenpaitanwhich is not my preferred type of ramen.they have tonkatsu next door which i would opt to try next time.we ended up choosing this place over the one next door because this one had a line out the door and they did not.this place was good.it was very busy but the service was quick.i love ramen, and if they are doing it right, i do not have much to complain about.the soup is much thicker than tonkatsu, but it was still creamy and the noodles were cooked well.i prefer my noodles yawa and my boyfriend prefers them futsu or kata.i like that here you can specify without seeming like you are dtm.it was a good dinner and i'm not disappointed in coming here, but i think i will try next door next time!"
370,Shayan S.,1115,2,8/4/18,"would i go here again i would rather try somewhere new.but if you want to check this off your list go to the one on the east side vs. west side if possible. it is bigger, the music is better, you get seated faster, the service was ridiculously quick too. i got thechickenpaitanwithchickenchar siu, and spicy bamboo shoots and the seasoned egg. thechickenchar siu was dry. the broth was nice and light, the texture of the noodles were lovely. the bamboo shoots were not f cking around. they were insanely spicy, so just be prepared for that. the seasoned egg was not the best i've had but it was still pretty good."
371,Peter T.,1115,5,7/27/18,"i do not really eat ramen that much but my siblings and cousins took me to toto ramen while in vacation at nyc. i would say i was surprised and pleased with the experience. the serving was great. i ordered an extra hard boiled egg and pork chunk to mychickenpaitan. it was worth the price. limited seating inside but makes for a more authentic feel. it gets really steamy when you sit at the bar as they make your noodle in real time. however, i'm willing to forgive that just cuz the food was great. will definitely come back when in the area."
372,Mei L.,1115,3,7/24/18,"so my boss has been raving about this place as a place i have need to try as i am a big ramen fan, but i am a picky ramen fan. i usually have high expectations, as there are so many ramen places popping up, but i grade the bowl of ramen based on broth, noodles, toppings and service. i got the spicypaitana with pork char shu.broth rich and creamy, had a good amount of flavor for being achickenbased compare to pork based ramen. noodles my ramen came with straight noodles, which i like as much as the curly, but it seems a little over cooked. at ippudo's, you can get it cooked a certain way and i like my noodles a little chewier. toppings it was topped with bran sprouts and green onions sliced the long way. i know that not all ramen places put the same toppings, but for the basic without add ons seems a little lacking. i would have like some bamboo shoots, wood ear mushroom, etc. the add on would have cost much more than the ramen itself . also it did not come with a ramen egg for the spicy one i got.additionally, the pork was a little dry for me and could have braised a little more but that is just me . service we got seated at the bar quickly and the server was super nice. we left a nice tip. i also did get the pork buns and it was braised well, but i do like ippudo's buns more.overall, the experience was good, and this place is a solid place to eat at price is good but when i compare it to other ramen places as a whole, it falls in my expectations a little. maybe if i get thechickenpaitanwithout the spicy as the spicy has more pepper than spicy. i did taste it before mixing and the first sip without the spicy was delicious."
373,Jennifer Z.,1115,4,7/19/18,"i'm not a huge ramen person but totto ramen definitely hit the spot as a really really good ramen place that i would recommend to anyone who visits new york. my sister and i ordered thechickenpaitanand the megapaitan two of which i would say are must trys at totto. i think those are the two most famous well known ones as well! the seating there is just seating as it goes so do not really expect to be able to sit by yourselves my family ended up sitting at a table with another couple, however it is not bothersome at all. the restaurant is very tiny and very loud but the food makes it worth it. the broth in both of the dishes were very creamy and delicious and the noodles had a perfect elasticity to them. the amount of meat that is given in the megapaitanmakes it completely worth the price. regular ramen in dallas normally only gives you around pieces of char siu, rarely but in the megapaitanthere were almost around pieces of meat!! being someone who is not a big fan of ramen, i was definitely converted after trying totto."
374,Ariel R.,1115,5,7/17/18,"my coworker and i had the pleasure of enjoying lunch at totto ramen while we were visiting new york city for a trade show. when we arrived, there was a large line outside, but a hostess saw us, asked if there were two of us, and swiftly got us seated.it is small on the inside and has an urban feel, but it is comfortable and homey. the waitresses were friendly and took our orders. my coworker ordered thechickenpaitanand i ordered the spicychickenpaitan. when they put spicy on the menu, they were not kidding. it. was. hot. i had to keep taking a break because i kept coughing and sweating, but man was it good! the flavor of the spices, the broth, the noodles, everything was delicious. prior to eating at totto ramen, i had never had ramen like this before. it is legit!"
375,Katherine Z.,1115,5,7/11/18,"totto is my favorite ramen place in manhattan. they specialize inchickenbroth ramen paitan , and they do it well. the noodles grab onto the the rich and meaty flavor of broth and theirchicken pork is always so tender and cooked perfectly. i usually add a boiled egg to my order as well, because the runny yolk compliments the ramen nicely.my regular order has become the spicychickenpaitan. if you are not a person who likes spice, i would go for the regular but i think that their spice adds a whole new dimension to the flavor.the actual shop is small and there is always a line, but they have a system of taking orders while you are in line so your food comes out a few short minutes after you are seated. the staff knows how to work efficiently and they will get people in and out of the shop as quickly as possible."
376,Danae L.,1115,5,7/7/18,"very small restaurant, hence the long wait. i counted, roughly chairs even the restroom is cramped, probably a couple centimeters more spacious than one on an airplane.unfortunately despite the long way, there is no text message system that allows you to put your name down and go around to nearby bars. they also try to take your order before you are seated to help speed the process. i highly recommend coming as early as possible!onto the food! highly recommend thechickenpaitanwith pork. my boyfriend and i ordered the same entr ] c e with either pork orchickento try both. thechickenwas dry, definitely going to the pork.if you are on your looking for nearby ramen restaurants, you will probably find totto and ippuodo westside as they are near each other. the difference totto does not have a text message system, cash only, and no room to hide from the rain. ippuodo has them all.broth and pork, totto is the winner.seasoned boiled egg and noodles, ippuodo wins.cannot go wrong with either of them, enjoy!"
377,Paul I.,1115,5,6/26/18,"my fiancee and i were visiting new york city hopping around the city enjoying several libations and taking in the town us being california natives . suddenly, hunger struck like a villain of hell's kitchen deliberately trying to ruin our night. we instantly thought of ramen to be our hero. we took to instagram to poll our social audience to see which ramen spot they would recommend. overwhelmingly it was totto.totto luckily was around the corner and this is where our journey actually was just beginning. we started with some pork buns and sake. the sake was the perfect appetite wetter and the pork buns were very enjoyable. then, out of nowhere, we were blessed with a bowl of the megapaitan. it sported perfectly cooked al dente ramen noodles,chickenpaitan, char siu pork, pork belly chunks, and a solft boiled egg.the broth was rich. the meat was tender. the egg was beautiful. great experience! highly recommend. thank you totto, thank you.cheers!"
378,Hui L.,1115,3,6/7/18,"i did not know i could lovechickenpaitan i consider myself a tonkotsu ramen fan but totto's make have convinced me otherwise.came here for an early dinner as it is going to be my last week working in this area and did not have to wait long for a seat by the kitchen. yeah the stools have no backs and there are also no hooks for bags or anything so i just held my bag. it was cool watching the chefs at work while they put together the ramen bowls and stir the hot giant pots of soup bases. they do add some kind of special sauce or oil from a brown jar before adding in the rest of the components of the dish. maybe it adds flavor i went with the classicchickenpaitanwithchicken instead of pork which i later regretted . they also offered this dish with miso but i wanted to taste thechickensoup on it is own with any influences from other umami flavors. i'm totally fine with few toppings.my bowl came out in about minutes. thechickenhad the consistency of slightly softerchickenbreast meat. definitely should have gotten the pork char siu instead. the noodles were soft. i did not really get or care for the raw onions on top and chopped scallions. the soup is definitely the star of the bowl. i did not knowchickenbroth could taste so good! it is almost almost on par with the richness of tonkotsu broth! towards the bottom of the bowl though, it gets a bit grainy. as in tiny pieces of shreddedchickenhave sunk to the bottom and the last bit of soup you want to drink has the texture of drinking some poorly mixed powdered drink.so verdict tried it. but tonkotsu broth still wins."
379,Debbie d.,1115,1,5/30/18,"this place, compared to ippudo, is average. the buns ea are good, the ramen is not. ordered theirchickenpaitan , tasted average. the megapaitanat tasted average too. every small addition to the ramen, like half egg and spices are extra . went here a week ago, no a c, crazy hot inside. and they really rush you to get out. do not forget your cash, and tip %, the japanese servers are so onpoint with their math that they confront you on the spot if you are missing a few cents to make the % mark which is not deserved given the sweaty ambience and rushed service ."
380,Leslie T.,1115,4,5/29/18,"people have been raving about totto ramen forever and it was good, but honestly nothing too special. i realize that most people order thechickenpaitanand i opted for classic tonkotsu. maybe that is why i was only satisfied and not impressed but i was happy about the price, especially it was just as if not slightly less yummy compared to ippudo and other ramen places in the area. definitely better than mentoku where people go if totto's wait is too long haha . after tax and tip it came out to and i left full and satisfied. came at pm on the saturday of memorial day weekend and there was no wait last time i had wanted to go was dinner on the saturday of labor day and the wait was . hours. so got to try your luck "
381,Katherine Z.,1115,5,5/18/18,"hole in the wall joint with high turnaround. my friend and i came at around pm on a friday and waited about minutes, not bad. they seem to have a good process of circulating customers in and out. got thechickenpaitanwith pork and it was just simply good. no complaints, the broth was good and noodles were perfectly chewy. i tried my friend'schickenand it was a bit too dry. very pleased with my whole experience."
382,Annette L.,1115,5,5/5/18,"wowww totto ramen really surprised me.btw this is the original and totto ramen next door is the tonkotsu sister restaurant.honestly i was skeptical about eatingchickenramen bc i've only had tonkotsu aka pork being from california & spoiled with menya ultra and orenchi . the sound ofchickenramen sounded. healthy cringe but i was very wrong. it was amazing. a must try when in nyc.food extra spicychickenpaitanwithchicken, option ofchickenmeat or pork ~ a perfect bowl of ramen! the spicy sauce similar to a saute sauce comes on the side. the soup was flavorful with a balance between salty and fatty on the lighter side of fat compared to tonkotsu but will not leave you feeling heavy . the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente ask if you want more cooked . thechickenwas sooooooo good. it was not dry at all but it was not too salty or fatty either. please teach me how to cook mychickenlike this ah.misopaitan comes with half a boiled egg, ground pork, bean sprouts, and a choice of char siu orchicken. was not as huge of a fan of this one because i felt like the miso flavoring was not strong enough for me. but the egg was amazing. i would definitely add this to my ramen.sapporo bottled was hoping for draft ~ service amazing service with smiles everywhere ! wait on wednesday for a table of at pm was minutes.ambiance casual with dim lighting. small place with a ramen bar and about side tables for slightly larger parties not good for tables of + ."
383,Diana C.,1115,4,4/21/18,"it was raining and exactly pm opening time but already there was a wait with several names on the waiting list. it is recommended to come a bit earlier than pm so you can try to get inside and be the first or so seated since the restaurant is small with just a bar counter and a table that seats and people. the counter is great to sit at and watch them cook as you eat. you can see them torch the pork and create the ramen bowls in front of your eyes.i got thechickenpaitanwith pork and piece cha siu bun to split with my friend. it was delicious, it was filling, and something about sitting at the counter and watching the cooks prepare the ramen elevates the eating experience.cash only."
384,Joe D.,1115,5,10/13/18,"totto is literally the greatest ramen i have ever had!me and my girlfriend have been there almost times, and every single time, the same order we always get extra spicy paitan with pork and aseasonedboiledegg, an avocado bun and a pork bun are amazing.the broth and whatever base is used has such a great taste. it is almost hard to explain.everything is always cooked perfectly, and the bowls are huge! the pork bun is phenomenal as well. i could eat !we will probably be back again next week."
385,Dakota B.,1115,5,3/14/18,"we had such a great time here! the waitress outside who took our orders and seated us was very friendly and accommodating.this restaurant did things a little bit different than most others, in that we ordered our food before being seated. i assume they do this because of how small the interior of the store is. but by the time we were seated, we only had to wait minutes before our food was placed before us.i ordered the chicken paitan, and i added theseasonedboiledegg. if you are into spicy food, you could try the spicy paitan, or ask for their spicy sesame oil to add a kick.if you are looking for a place to try ramen in the big apple, this is an awesome place to try!"
386,Sapan P.,1115,5,1/29/18,"totto ramen is one of my favourite places to get ramen in the city. its central location in the city on nd between th and th, and another one on nd between nd and rd makes it super easy to get to and their consistency in flavour and price is comparable to no other.from the outside, totto ramen seems likes an uncomfortably small fastserve restaurant with bar only seating but they have plenty of seating in the back for groups up to people. there is usually a waiting time but i've never experienced it to be longer than minutes. after eating there, i realize why this is the case. their service is extremely speedy and they have a sufficiently large waiting staff that continually keeps the flow of customers moving in and out of the restaurants for new diners to enjoy.the menu is small and well done and offers a variety of ramen options even to those that prefer milder flavours such as me. i had their chicken paitan original straight noodles in house made chicken paitan soup topped with scallions, onions, nori, and char siu chicken and added a few toppings pulled char siu chicken pcs for ,seasonedboiledegg , bamboo shoots . the chicken was extremely lean which made some of the char siu chicken seem a little dry, but the broth in which is was soaked in completely revived it is flavour and texture. the noodle were cooked to be perfectly al dente and their ratio of noodles to meat to toppings was perfect. you were able to enjoy chicken in each bite and taste the saltiness and spices in the broth.what sets totto ramen apart from other ramen restaurants is the thickness and flavour of their broth along with the freshness of ingredients that they use. they keep their menu simple which allows them to offer a great product consistently at a low price. i will definitely be back and hopefully be a regular for every time i am in midtown looking for great, hot, flavourful ramen!"
387,Kyu S.,1115,5,3/3/17,"i find it necessary to eat at totto every time i come to manhattan! from its homemade noodles to the savory broth, the bowl is to die for. you get a filling portion of food with your option of adding various toppings. i love the spicy paitan they give you the spicy sauce on the side so you can build your spice level to your desire. it can get super busy so try to go during nonpeak hours if you do not want to wait!tip addseasonedboiledegg, corn, and spicy bamboo shoot for more flavor!"
388,Lauren T.,1115,5,1/18/16,"absolutely delicious! some of the best ramen i've had, and portions that you can actually finish! definitely get the spicy ramen withseasonedboiledegg."
389,Judy L.,1115,4,6/9/15,"dined here for a late dinner at around pm on a thursday night. there is a waiting list that you sign up for a table at the door. we were originally waiting for a table of six, but we took the suggestions from other review on totto to split up the group so that we would get seated quicker. we waited about an hour on the busy sidewalk and stairs until the hostess server called for your name to see if your were still around waiting for a table. to save time, they will take your order while you are waiting for a table which i found great as we were starving!atmosphere the space of the establish is really small and is what is expected of new york. i think you could only fit a max of people patrons + work staff in the restaurant. there is bar seating and maybe four square tables along the wall. sitting at the bar is awesome because you get to watch the chefs prep your ramen like we did! the service was okay as we had to ask for water halfway through our meal. we definitely waited longer for a table ~ hour than we actually took to finish+pay for our meal ~ minutes . you do not want to sit too long after you complete your meal as there are still tons of people waiting for tables!food spicy ramen both my brother and friend ordered this and they really liked it. they ordered it with chicken instead of the charsiu pork . spicy nisbo i ordered this and was happy that i did as i did not want anything that was too boring or too much in taste and flavor. i opted to add in aseasonedboiledeggfor an extra . i also ordered my ramen with chicken instead of the charsiu pork . i was pleased to find that the ramen at totto was overly salty as it is in a lot of other ramen places that i've dined at.the three bowls of ramen+additional toppings came down to +tip was pretty good in price and value!overall, a great experience with ramen in nyc. i would definitely love to visit their other locations in the surrounding area!just a tip cash only! good thing there is a bank of america right around the corner!"
390,Ben L.,1115,4,3/25/15,"hallelujah! praise the lord! oh sweet baby jesus! i finally found a ramen spot i really enjoyed. i am a lover of all things culinarily japanese, but ramen has always been a deep dark hole for me since i have yet to find a respectable ramen joint, till tonight. i know there are like . billion reviews of this place, so my review would just get lost in the mix but i wanted to give my two cents. my party of four arrived at pm and it was only a min wait, the line does seem pretty diesel but it moves pretty fast. the restaurant consists of a long bar where you slurp ramen and only four seater tables and that is it. the restaurant is tight, waits can be long but general food rule, you do not deviate from the original location, there is a long ass wait for a reason. so on my ramen quest, i have been to ippudo, ramen setagaya, momofuku noodle bar, rai rai ken, hinomaru, ajisen ramen and now totto ramen which is the king of ramen for me. also, the bathroom is so small that turning around is damn near impossible and the restaurant is cash only.the food totto spicy ramen chicken broth, original rayu a spicy sesame oil, topped with scallion, bean sprouts, and nori with choice of char siu pork or with char siu chicken. i really loved every element of the ramen except the char siu pork. the broth had such a depth of flavor, the noodles had such a wonderful, chewy texture with a nice mouth feel but the pork was a miss. the pork was so dry and overcooked, i did not like the char siu pork, i think i will try the with char siu chicken on my next visit. the spicy really is not all that spicy, and a must to the ramen is the addition of theseasonedboiledegg. it is a but it is so good. this is the hands down best ramen i have had in ny.yelp.com user_local_phot,a char siu pork bun the pork bun is kinda the big item that most ramen places serve and the one here was a miss for me. the pork bun was ok, but i guess they use the same pork from the ramen since it was dry and overdone, as well. i have a lot of pork bun pet peeves and this place committed a few of them the bun basically was glued to the plate, the pork was not moist, fatty and unctuous as it should have been, mayo is a big no no and my biggest pet peeve is the lettuce addition. i really cannot understand for the life of me why there is lettuce.yelp.com user_local_phot,a "
391,Sara L.,1115,5,2/14/15,"you cannot go wrong with totto ramen well, at least this one nyc original location . the pork broth ramen is one of the best in the city comparable to ippudo and mu . moreover, where totto really shines is in their vegetarian offering.totto's spicy vegetable ramen is my favorite vegetarian ramen and one of my favorite ramen in general . the broth is rich, the spice adds a delicious kick, and the toppings draw envious glances from your porkrameneating neighbors. totto introduced me to avocado slices in ramen broth ahhh genius. also, this ramen has a generous helping of shittake mushrooms, which i love.in general, i always add theseasonedboiledegg. it is soft and warm and yummy.they have a signup sheet outside the door. while seating is very limited and quoted wait times are very long, the line moves faster than you might expect people ditch . also, the ambiance is conducive to solo dining single person signups tend to move quickest up the wait list. anyway, it is a slurpandleave kind of place, so please save long conversations for a nearby bar, focus on the ramen, and then free up your seats for me! ."
392,Sarah A.,1115,4,1/13/15,yum! i made sure to keep my expectations in check having really good ramen in the bay area. but i was impressed! i think we were lucky that we came at of the clock at night so we barely had to wait. i also liked that the decor is more urban compared to a fancier ippudo.i had the totto spicy and it was the perfect amount of heat for the freezing night that it was. i added aseasonedboiledeggwhich was nice and soft. friends got the wavy noodles but i liked the homemade straight ones. the chicken broth is rich and creamy and way better than some pork broths i've had before.coming in winter makes the space even tighter with bulky jackets everywhere so be prepared to bump elbows with your friends. and of course if only it was not cash only. i would definitely come back though. 
393,Ildiko K.,1115,3,1/3/15,"i went here with my boyfriend who is an international student from japan. i am writing this review with his input as he has eaten much more ramen in his life then i have.first off, we got there at pm, when it first opens and already there was a long line. we were told we would have to wait mins for a seat, which turned out to be accurate.after we were sat, we ordered the miso ramen, paitan ramen, and two of the char sui bao. one woman on the end of the bar next to us ordered a little bit before. however, she got her order well before a group of four sitting behind us who came in and ordered mins before. because we were at the bar, we could see the way the orders were coming in and being made as well as the chefs cooking. it seemed that the orders were being filled in a random order rather than a first come first served basis, which we though was weird.our food came and it was fine, but not worth waiting mins for. to quote my boyfriend, his miso ramen was not bad. therefore, we are rating totto stars. i ordered aseasonedboiledeggand so did a girl next to me. hers was fired with a blow torch to become warm and gooey, mine was not. lastly, on a side note. one of the chefs broke a bowl and the pieces spilled into a lot of the toppings boxes. the boxes were replaced as they were contaminated with the pieces of the bowl, which is obviously the right thing to do. however, my boyfriend then heard the owner tell the chef in japanese to put less toppings on the ramen from then on to make up for the cost of the bowl. wtf ! talk about cheap!"
394,Hannah L.,1115,4,12/31/14,"the food and service is good here. i came the day after christmas, a bit after pm and the line was already really long they opened at pm that day . luckily, we were able to leave our name down and the lady told us an approximate time of when we should come back to be seated. i liked that i did not just have to wait on the long line, but i was able to use that time to go elsewhere and come back to be seated for the food. so, i would highly recommend that when you arrive, you should immediately write your name down and ask them when you should come back!as for the food, i ordered the totto spicy ramen with aseasonedboiledeggand i loved it! the portion was not too big or too small and the broth was on point. the totto spicy ramen was not too salty which i enjoyed. my friends ordered the spicy vegetable ramen and paitan ramen and they enjoyed it, too.aside for the long wait i waited for almost a hour , everything was great! the service was great. the food came fast. although it is small inside and there is a long wait outside, they did not rush you to finish your food so they can seat other people.i would definitely come back in the future."
395,Debra T.,1115,4,12/28/14,"came here with my sister and cousin for dinner at around pm on a saturday night and there was a huge line out the door. not only was i annoyed with the quoted hour wait, but it was freezing out. to our luck though, a party of was a no show and the hostess brought us in to sit at the bar. we were so ecstatic for so many reasons! warmth, the fact that we only waited minutes in line and there were at least parties ahead of us sorry we are not sorry! , and ramen the moment we have been waiting for. we ordered char siu pork buns to share and i ordered the totto chicken paitan ramen w seasonedboiledegg. omg. it was all absolutely delicious! the broth was so deeply flavored and savory, the noodles were fresh with the perfect texture and the braised pork belly was succulent. overall though, i still love ippudo more probably because of their thicker broth andseasoning. yet, totto is pretty amazing too!"
396,Dubs V.,1115,4,11/19/14,"this was the best bowl of noodles i've ever had, and i've had many. we ordered extra noodles twice and basically rolled outside, barely able to move. it is not the kind of place to sit down and take your time slurp down your noodles and get moving. but damn, are they good noodles. i recommend adding some spicy sesame oil if you order extra spicy they will give you some on the side and theseasonedboiledegg. yum. extra scallions, too!so why four stars . it takes about min or even longer of standing in a queue to get in. if it were not for that, i would come every week."
397,Sarah N.,1115,5,11/9/14,"totto ramen is a dinner and show!i absolutely love this place, it is the best ramen place i have tried thus far.the wait i got there at for their dinner service and the wait was already min hr! totto ramen faithfuls are on it. so be early! the inside sits maybe people at a time or less.the food the most popular dishes are the spicy ramen . and the mega ramen . with a choice of either pork or chicken. go with the pork. it is so good. it is soft and moist and . i will just stop there. if you like eating spicy things but not too spicy, do not be afraid to go with the spicy ramen.add ons things like theseasonedboiledegg, avocado, bamboo shoot comes in a bag unfortunately etc etc. all very good.the broth my favorite part of the whole dish. the broth is thicker than most ramen making it feel like a more heartier dish and it is flavored with garlic paste, among other things. giving it that comehither smell and umami taste.also, a shoutout to the very courteous staff. how they keep calm in the mob of people is amazing! will definitely be returning. cash only!"
398,Honghui Y.,1115,4,10/15/14,"finally got around to writing a review for this place! let me start out by saying that i love ramen, and i'm the type who does not mind waiting an hour in line just for a warm bowl of springy noodles. however, if you are not someone who can handle a + minute wait time, then do not come to totto it is that simple. just know that you will be missing out because the ramen here is fantastic. i always get the spicy ramen, which is a good middle ground if you want your noodles to pack a little heat, but do not think your stomach will be able to withstand the extra spicy, which comes with hot pepper signs. the noodles themselves are great cooked to just the right texture, giving a little resistance when you bite down. the broth is super flavorful, though quite greasy. for me, the char siu pork is the highlight. i do not know how it is cooked here, but the slices of pork have just the right amount of fat rendered and a gorgeous char on the outside. it is sad that you only get two slices per bowl though.extra pork is . for two pieces. i always get my ramen with aseasonedboiledegg. yes, it is extra but whatever, it is delicious.this place does not have a c which can be a pain during the summer. i came here once when it was degrees outside it was probably about degrees hotter in here since the place is tiny, and the hot broth is cooked just a few feet away from the seating area. all the waiters and cooks had sweat streaming down their faces not exactly the most sanitary. also, speaking of cleanliness, i came here another time when there was an extremely funky smell emanating from the back. obviously, this was not the greatest accompaniment to my meal, and it makes me question the way they are handling their food. despite these minor complaints though, i would still recommend totto to any ramen aficionado.by the way, cash only! ugh. "
399,Sarah K.,1115,5,9/3/14,"the best ramen i have every tasted!! my bf and i waited about an hour to be seated, but it was well worth it! we each ordered the totto spicy ramen with char siu pork andseasonedboiledegg. we also ordered the pork bun on the side which was very tasty! i just wished that there was cold air conditioning because it got very hot and humid inside the restaurant.overall, i definitely recommend this place for ramen! i will be coming back here for sure the next time i visit new york!"
400,Linda L.,1115,4,8/10/14,"came here a little before pm on a friday in august, and was pleasantly surprised that the wait would only be around min. granted i was only one person, but there was barely anyone waiting outside though the interior was pretty full .i had the totto spicy ramen with theseasonedboiledeggas a topping. the ramen was pretty good, though theeggwas what shined. this was not your ordinaryboiledegg. the yolk was golden perfection, not a hint of green grey at the exterior and was cooked just enough so it would not be runny. theeggseemed to have been marinated in soy sauce, so the exterior was stained light brown. god, i would have ordered three of these babies if i had no self control."
401,Y C.,1115,3,6/7/14,"ordered spicy ramen with pork, and addedseasonedboiledegg, for a total of before tax. only a couple of slices of pork and noodle portion is small. but the chicken soup is delicious. the nonspicy version would be better as you can drink more soup. taste is , but portion is ."
402,Jeff J.,1115,4,5/27/14,"lunch for . ambiance a small dingy shack with just seats small tables and the rest bar seating makes it the ultimate authentic ramen experience. the music could be a bit less obnoxious though. service extremely fast and courteous waters are refilled quickly without prompting, and the food comes out blazing fast. unidon a small portion of slightly smoky uni served over rice with some thin cut strips of shiso leaf. each bite more delicious than the next. however, if you are going to serve just a little bit of uni, then i would prefer getting less rice. spicy totto ramen w bamboo shoots, corn,seasonedboiledegg, + each topping, the broth is undeniably fragrant, and the spicy oil drizzled on top makes it extra fiery. totto is not joking around when they put lots of pepper icons next to the menu item. the noodles were also firm the way i like. the corn and bamboo shoots were also welcome additions, but boy oh boy thiseggwas a severe disappointment. my idea of a good ramen always includes a perfectegg, so getting an overdoneeggin my otherwise brilliant masterpiece was a severe issue. value considering totto's popularity, i was surprised the prices were this reasonable. not unlike any other ramen joint. final wordeverything about the ramen is as advertised. yes, it is worth the wait. had the unidon been a bit more otherworldly, i might have been able to overlook theegg, but as it stands, totto falls just short of greatness."
403,Lee H.,1115,5,11/1/18,"ramen is so popular in nyc but yet it is hard to find one that i really like. over the years i've tried many ramen restaurants and i always go back to totto ramen. their broth is just so flavorful. the noodle's texture is ok. i love thespicypaitan, and i add an egg sometimes. the staff is always so welcoming and friendly. there are hooks under the bar table to hang purses and bags. the wall has hangers for jackets. there is always a wait so get your name on the list as soon as you arrive. remember they only accept cash."
404,Khoa N.,1115,5,9/28/18,"definitely one of best bowls of noodles i have ever eaten. i have tried thespicypaitan, extraspicymiso, thespicybonito, as well as the tsukemen. everything was delicious. flavorful broth, thick savory pieces of cha sui, and perfectly chewy noodles.they do have good days and bad days but overall it is mostly delicious. today was one of the best days. i savored every bite and spoonful of myspicymiso ramen. it was perfection. a solid ."
405,Owais K.,1115,1,8/20/18,"the main reason this is a star is because of customer experience. will not repeat or recommend to family and friends.food decent, noodles were soft and the chicken was cooked to the right temperature. broth would need some improvement. but it is not something that i will want to try again.customer service worst, rude waitress. illogical store policy simply trying to loot tourists.pros do not have to wait long for the food to come out.decent food portion.cons cash only businesssmall seating arrangements.stupid store policy. order per customer even if the customer is a year old baby.detail i took a weekend trip to nyc with my wife and year old. around pm we were craving some ramen and i found this place over yelp. looked pretty good with stars and over reviews. the place was very small but all tables and counter tops was taken and the business was running good. had to wait mins before we got a table.we got seated and were handed the menu, when the waitress came over to take the order she said that 'as per store policy i need to order minimum dishes since we are people'. wait a minute are you counting a year old baby as an adult well i ended up wasting around on something which was left untouched while he sat there watching cartoons on the phone. i ordered the megapaitan while my wife ordered spicypaitan and if you are wondering what i got for my son it was an avocado bun . while taking the order the waitress let us know that they do not accept cards its cash only and the bill would be around . let us stop and check the calendar to see which year we are in, last i saw it was . i asked my wife and she said she has around with her i never carry any cash its only my debit card and drivers license .we finished our food and it was time to pay the bill. so i asked my wife to give me the money and to our surprise when she looked inside her purse she only had . i felt bad that i did not have enough money to tip the waitress so i called her over and said that i do have the money to pay the bill but not enough to tip her and if there was any other way to swipe my card. to my shock this was her response you knew how much the bill was before eating . i do not think i have to explain what she meant here."
406,Christina N.,1115,5,7/20/18,"here's a tip, make sure you get your name down on their list before waiting in line lol. there were people getting behind a line that was just started to stay close to the restaurant since there is no where else to really wait at. me and other friends probably only waited minutes which was not bad at all, heard people have waited hours though. i ordered theirspicypaitan, by far the best ramen that i've ever had. the broth was flavorful and it has a nice kick to it, been to a few ramen places in la originally from the west coast and i've yet to find a place that has a similar taste."
407,Sheng H.,1115,5,6/22/18,"one of the best ramen. it was so good! i arrived alone on a saturday night to get a bowl since the review was so great. only thing that bothered me was that i did not know we had to sign in. there was not hostess at the front so i did not sign in and waited for someone, i saw a couple walk passed me to the stand in the front with the list and picked up the pen so they can sign in. i signed in after them, grabbed a menu and decided on what i wanted. i got called to be seated early since it was only me.i ordered the extraspicypaitanramen. it was so good! i definitely recommend this to others. it is a must try!"
408,Wallace L.,1115,4,6/22/18,"this place has one of the best chicken broths! i ordered # spicypaitan and it was just enoughspicythat i could enjoy it without being too overwhelming. the cha siu was heated on the spot and had a solid, roasted yet tender feeling. however, there was a lack of other toppings for the high price i paid. i came party of when the restaurant opened for dinner and it already had a full house the restaurant can only fit approx. people at once. we waited for about min until we were promptly seated. the waitress took our order in line so we had our ramen delivered immediately after seating which is a plus!i cannot give it stars because it was cash only and when we paid with a , they automatically took a % tip without even asking."
409,LeAnne B.,1115,3,5/28/18,"after eating here i was sadly left wondering why there is a line for this place. i had the nonspicypaitanand it was just too oily for my taste. i tried to finish it but could not. to be honest, the ramen place by my apartment is a lot better than this and has no line. luckily the appetizer here was really good and saved the meal the mayo don pork . it has nice smoky meat and flavorful rice. eating that, i thought the main course was going to be just as good! sadly disappointed. my advice would be to just order appetizers here and skip the ramen completely."
410,Christopher D.,1115,3,5/7/18,"tried totto ramen for the first time on a saturday night. because we were looking to eat around pm, we opted for this location since it closes at midnight. our group of got there around pm and got our name on a list there was a crowd waiting already. around pm, they stopped taking names.the hostess took our orders before we sat so that the kitchen could get to work preparing. when it came time to sit, the hostess asked if we were okay splitting in a table of two and a table of three, as we would be able to sit much sooner compared to waiting for a table of . we were fine with that and two of us sat at the bar and three at a table.we got an order of the chicken bun and then thespicypaitanramen and added corn and soft boiled eggs. the chicken buns were okay, a little heavy on the mayonnaise. the ramen was flavorful and the noodles were cooked well. but the broth was very very thick, almost gravylike consistency. not sure that was because it was the end of the night or that is the normal broth for them. either way, not my preference.would not say no to going back and trying another location or another time, but would not seek it out with the other options in the neighborhood."
411,Rebecca Clay E.,1115,5,4/23/18,"i went around pm on a sunday and we immediately got seated. this was the cutest hole in the wall ramen shop, exactly what i was looking for! you walk down some steps and enter this small restaurant but that just added to the adventure. this was my mother's first ever ramen so i wanted it to be as authentic as possible and i was very pleased.we began with the pork buns and they were so tender and fresh. i have not had too many pork buns before and these will definitely be hard to beat. i definitely recommend getting them!then, of course, we all ordered different ramen options. the megapaitan,spicypaitanand misopaitan. all were awesome! but the mega paitain was our favorite. however i do not think you could go wrong with anything that you order here.the atmosphere could not have been beat. the music was upbeat and cool and the staff was incredibly fast. if you are looking for an authentic and fun ramen experience in new york, definitely go here."
412,Kristelle B.,1115,2,4/17/18,"i've had high expectations coming into totto ramen because they said this is one of the best ramen places in nyc. i ordered thespicypaitanwhich lackedspiciness, much to my dismay. the pork buns are also nothing special. it is not the worst place though for a ramen fix because it is pretty cheap at bowl."
413,Amy N.,1115,3,4/8/18,"foggy day and i needed my ramen fix and i thought this place would help me satisfy my ramen craving. i went at noon on a weekday and the line was out the door and my friend & i had to wait an hour just to get seated. once we got inside, the tables were small and close together, leaving little room to move around. i ordered the misopaitanwhile she ordered thespicypaitan. i cannot say anything for my friend, but my ramen was flavorless. the noodles were just the way i like them and the egg was nice and runny, but overall it was not as great as it was hyped up to be, so star. i also took off another star because of this one worker who upset us. the bill came up to about . we gave her because of tip and she kept hassling us to give more money. she was basically begging us to give more money even though us youngins do not have the money to be really generous tippers. do not expect me to come again. the bland ramen and the greedy worker left a bad taste in my mouth about this place."
414,Ryan M.,1115,5,4/4/18,"really good ramen spot in hell's kitchen. they are open til midnight on weeknights not much else is around here and a recent visit at pm found the place just about packed. service is brisk but they turn and burn pretty good here, so you will be steaming your face over a delicious pile of noodles in no time. decor is divey, vibe is lively and the crowd is mixed at that hour anyway. it could be nicer here, but i'm really going for food quality it is a ramen joint so i will not be too harsh given the fair prices and great food.thespicypaitanwas really good but not veryspicy, so if you want it hot do not be shy to drop two sheckles and get it extraspicy. my friend and i had a few apps as well and all were very good. prices are totally reasonable here and i like it enough that i will probably regret trying other ramen in midtown versus just coming back here again. so maybe i will just come back here first and avoid the let down.ps cash only be prepared!"
415,Rose S.,1115,5,8/8/18,"we came here on a friday night around pm and the wait time was about minutes. the place is tiny but the turnaround is quick. probably because there is no ac and it was cooler outside than in the restaurant. table seating is very limited and then there is the bar.we sat at the bar right in front of the steaming broth. i ordered the spicy miso and my husband ordered themegapaitan. both both ramen were so very good and probably our favorite in nyc. however, next time i may order the miso and spice on the side, because halfway through my ramen, the broth became wayyy to salty. we also ordered the rice with roe and pork bun. both of these were just okay and could have done without.the service was very efficient,the gentleman stirring the broth hr minimum cooking was incredibly nice and worked so hard in the heat.cannot wait to return in the colder months a steaming bowl of ramen!"
416,Nathaniel P.,1115,5,7/23/18,"had themegapaitanramen and the original. probably best thing i've eaten all year it is february but whatever broth is very thick and there is a depth of flavor i've not had before in ramen. its reminiscent of a chicken noodle soup. i enjoyed the fresh onions and scallions in the soup it helped cut through the rich and salty broth. if you get the original, i encourage you to order an egg it is worth the two bucks. excited to come back and try their other ramen options.service is quick. there are limited seats and lots of people to accommodate so there is a very efficient turn over of customers."
417,Leo B.,1115,5,7/20/18,"currently my favorite ramen spot in the city. they have three, one onw , one on w and one on e . i go to the one on w since it is close to me and have never been let down. i always get themegapaitan do yourself a favor and get it, you will thank me later! every time i go. the broth is delicious on its own and the serving of meat s that come with it are filling even for a bigger guy like myself. i can eat themegapaitanall day every day if money was not an object. they prepare the noodles fresh and bring it to the table in less than minutes because it is a smaller restaurant. keep in mind it is cash only! enjoy!!"
418,Jessica P.,1115,4,6/17/18,"i love ramen and luckily they are all over nyc so it is not hard to find. i was excited to try this place after reading the reviews and being recommended by friends.fyi this place only takes cash. the space is small but service is fast so you probably will not be waiting for your table for long. i got themegapaitanramen and we got some bao buns with pork to share. the buns were good i wish there was more slaw or veggies to help cut the fat from the meat, the sauce on it made it feel more heavy. the ramen was a huge portion and loaded with your traditional toppings. it had plenty of char siu which was perfectly cooked. the egg was a perfect soft boil. the noodles were okay, but i wish the broth had a bit more flavor.a bit expensive for ramen, especially since there is so many options."
419,Isabella O.,1115,4,6/3/18,i get themegapaitan! always a good pick. the ratio of ramen and toppings was a little off. too much topping but is that a bad thing for me i need ramen with every bite. i usually go to the east side location where everything is more balanced i suppose. also i think the west side is more expensive it was . w o tip.
420,T P.,1115,3,5/30/18,"ordered the miso ramen, rich and not overly salted. the miso is sweet and not as salty i think it would be. ramen has a firm texture. skip the pork bun.tasteless and dry. went during lunch ard noon. waitied for min. good friendly services. saw other people ordered themegapaitan, looks good. the pork char siu tasted much better in the ramen then the one they used in the buns."
421,Karan P.,1115,5,5/26/18,megapaitanis a true delight !!! it is a lot of foodspicy sauce really enhances the flavors greatly.ambiance is not very good but definitely worth the quality served
422,Maria P.,1115,5,5/19/18,"best ramen i've ever had. it is a little hole in the wall and never not packed to the gills, but do not let that deter you. the wait is really short and you get to place your order while you wait, which is really efficient. just be aware that it is a cash only establishment.the food tasted heavenly! the bao bun was perfect. the bun itself was soft and fluffy and the pork was super thick, juicy, and flavorful. when i had the first taste of mymegapaitan, my insides melted into the most wonderful state of comfort and relaxation. all i wanted was to eat that giant bowl of soup on my couch, covered in a throw blanket, while watching netflix.do yourself a favor. stop by, have a bowl, and melt into wonderful relaxation like i did. it is a tiny spot but the food is amazing, the service is excellent, and the cleanliness is great a rating ."
423,Trina V.,1115,5,5/19/18,"love it!this restaurant is pretty tiny. from what i can see, there is a handful of bar seats and couple of tables in the back. so be prepared to wait. i'm assuming the best time to go is right when they open both for lunch and dinner.write your name on the clip board and wait for them to take your order. like ramen parlor, you order while you wait and it is ready for you when you are seated.the bf and i got spicy pakistan you have a choice between pork and chicken. i ended up getting the pork. the broth does not look or taste spicy at first, but the spice definitely builds up. reminds me of the kind of spice you get from ramen parlor's lobster broth.megapaitan this one comes with char siu pork and pork belly. the char siu was delicious, but the pork belly was amazing. it just fell apart and melted in your mouth. bf loves daikokuya and he said it is comparable to their ramen.it is even better because it is a mix of the two ramen places that we love.overall, the broths, noodles, and meats were great. a definite must try if you are in the area."
424,Viet T.,1115,5,5/3/18,"that broth is t h i c c thick. i came during a rather off time because there were about tables in the back and other people eating at the bar so they may not be as quick they were with me food came out in less than minutes, top ramen are not got nothing on totto for speed . it is a bit warm if you have counter seating but it is also fun watching the guys in the back assemble everything. service is brisk but friendly.big tip, the egg will be a bit coldlukewarm as a proper marinated egg should be so let it sit for a bit to warm the whites if a hot egg is your thing.so back to the first point that broth is t h i c c thick. it is a bit salty and i'm completely surprised it is all chicken. it is delicious. it is worth the hype. it is worth the sometimes hour long weekend wait not that i had to suffer this . you will save on lip balm. i had themegapaitanwhich came with shredded pulled pork, fatty pork belly, and charred chashu. the chashu is definitely one of the best bites. also there is pickled cabbage which really helps offset roundsoff everything i wish my bowl had more .prices are on par with most other ramen places which i feel is a dollar or higher than they should be but it is been set so. "
425,B K.,1115,4,4/16/18,"went there for lunch on sat just past pm, no wait. cash only is a bummer but chase bank is blocks away so we stopped by before going to the restaurant. i ordered themegapaitanand it was delicious. the soup was savory and a nice change of pace if like me, you always go for tonkatsu ramen. the noodle had great mouth feel and the right amount of chew. for the soup was slightly too salty to have on its own after you have finished the noodle, which i do believe is always the case with them as my friend who went a couple of years ago also mentioned this."
426,Siri C.,1115,5,1/5/18,"the thing i like about this place is the environment and the food. hand's down the best vegetarianramenin nyc. the flavor of thevegetableramenis enhanced by their super amazing garlic chili sauce. i make the trek just for their actual noodles and the way their broth makes it all come together. absolutely the best! would recommend to all my vegetarian friends.anticipate a min wait usually to be seated. food arrives quicker as the host takes your order when you check in to be seated. also, cash only. there are atms close by if you forget."
427,Sean S.,1115,2,12/19/17,"no i was not terribly impressed.when outoftowners come to new york, and they are all hyped & worked up about a place, i should know automatically what i'm getting into. i had no idea about these silly long lines. it reminds me of magnolia's bakery. someone saw it on tv and then the whole tvwatchingtourist train poured into the station!what i tried to find was some veggie stuff on the menu. you know i do not like being forgotten. yes there is avegetableramen. it was just ok.besides the crappy services & the long lines, the food was basic. i'm sorry but i've been to tons oframenplaces both in tokyo, st marks place, flushing, and various other locations around the city. and i was not wowed here."
428,Pranav G.,1115,5,11/12/17,my wife and i are vegetarians and we love thevegetableramen. servers are always quick! would recommend this place to everyone
429,Nick M.,1115,5,7/11/17,"unique setting, you probably will not hear the music they play here anywhere else. really small and cramped but that quality has a certain charm to it here. phenomenalramen! thevegetableramenis vegan! make sure you add bean sprouts and nori! incredibly busy but the staff was always accommodating and nice and never felt like they were overwhelmed or like we were being rushed."
430,Cortney S.,1115,5,7/2/17,"this was a great find for someramen. there was a bit of a wait, which just indicated even more that it was worth our time. we had thevegetableramenand the mega paitan. both came out super hot and looked just as good as it tasted. the staff was all super friendly and kind. be sure to perfect your chopstick skills and bring cash. this is a must try spot in the city!"
431,Linh H.,1115,3,5/4/17,"i usually do not like chicken base soup forramenbut i came here because one of my friends really loves this place, also it is so famous so why not!i got extra spicy paitan, my friends got miso paitan andvegetableramen. i did not try theirs so i cannot talk about them.as i said, i prefer pork base so the broth did not impress me much, still creamy but lack of thickness. the char siu pork was good, i do not think i ever got any bad char siu fromramenrestaurants. one thing surprised me most was the chili oil, it was actually really spicy, they put it on the side so it is pretty convenient.we also got pork buns and avocado buns. the pork buns somehow were lack of flavor, i wish they put char siu pork instead of braised pork, after eating bun, i felt sick of that pork lol. the avocado buns were great, very simple but they put a nice dressing inside which made them tasty.we went there on saturday afternoon, there were not many people so we did not wait for too long. it is also always crowded so not a place for you to eat and talk because i felt like the staffs were rushing us when we were eating lol.overall, i'm not sure i would come back here again forramenbecause i've triedramensfrom other areas and they were much better. but i guesd when i really want a bowl oframenwhen i'm around here, i might consider this place or ippudo."
432,C O.,1115,5,4/1/17,the original spot! love the uni over rice appetizer. and thevegetableramen really tiny spot so the wait time use to be a killer. it is a great place to walk into if there is no wait.
433,Rene M.,1115,3,3/21/17,thevegetableramenwas good but their main mega paitan was very fatty could not finish the bowl. per the game it has is said it is ok. then again i have some in tokyo maybe i am biased lol
434,David G.,1115,4,10/24/16,"it was a chilly october night, and we had just left the theater. we were craving something warm, satisfying, and inexpensive.ramensounded perfect. a quick yelp search showed that tottoramenwas just steps away from where we were.even though it was almost midnight, there was still a line to be seated at tottoramen. this was not surprising once i saw how tiny the place was just a handful of seats at a counter, and some cramped communal tables. the entire joint is the size of a shoebox. welcome to manhattan. thankfully, we only had to wait about minutes before being seated. to keep things moving efficiently, the hostess took our orders while we waited spicy nibo paitan for me, andvegetableramenfor my guest . once we were seated at one of the communal tables, our food came out within moments.theramenitself is quite good. it is all about the broth here rich, intense, flavorful. i also really enjoyed the noodles, which were sturdier than i'm used to al dente . the other components of the spicy nibo paitan were just okay. both the chicken and cabbage leaves were tough and rubbery, which was a bit of a letdown. i did manage to sneak in a taste of my guest'svegetableramen, and the veggies in that bowl were a lot better. all in all, tottoramenis a nice place to check out, but my favorite san diegobasedramenspots are still a notch above. side note tottoramenis cash only, so do not find yourself stranded with just your visa!

435,Judy L.,1115,4,7/30/16,"tottoramenwas everything years ago. now there are moreramenshops around and though they are not everything now, they are still consistently great. i'm used to this location when i visit the big apple and it is still my preference oframencompared to popular places, such as ippudo, in the city.unlike ippudo, the interior of tottoramenis no frills. it is a small space with four tables and the bar, with a tiny bathroom where you do all your business standing in the exact same spot. this place comes close toramenshops in japan.tottoramenis quite efficient. though the lines are not as crazy as they were years ago, you still have to put your name on the list and wait. they will call your party ahead of time to take your orders so when you get seated, your food is ready.i've tried almost everyramenhere and i can say the broth, al dente noodles and perfectly charred pork make their bowls quality. what makes this place stick out more for me is theirvegetableramen. it comes in regular and spicy options and both broths are so flavorful that you will not miss the meat."
436,Rocio C.,1115,5,6/19/16,"perfection is the word that comes to my mind after having a spicy paitan with chicken. it had exactly the right amount of spiciness, the chicken was juicy and tasty, noodles perfectly cooked and it was served fast and at the right temperature. the service is friendly and efficient and i cannot wait to come back and try the miso paitan and thevegetableramen!"

438,Leo L.,1115,2,4/29/16,"i heard so many great things about tottoramen. so, first day arrived nyc, we went straight to totto for a lunch. i ordered a spicy paitan and my husband ordered avegetableramen. we also ordered a appetizer, sesame chicken. if we did not order the appetizer, i would give stars for theramen. however, the appetizer was a huge disappointment. how can you cook a chicken so dry and hard to swallow it! seriously, anyone can make better boiled chicken at home with drip sesame sauce. my idea of a great or even just good restaurant every food should be at least at good standard across menu, not a great main course with a really bad appetizer!!!"
439,Emily C.,1115,4,4/17/16,my favoritevegetableramenin the city and i'm not a vegetarian. noodles are cooked to perfection and the broth is delicious. the saba mackerel is really good too. we usually come weeknights to avoid crowds.

443,Jando S.,1115,5,2/3/16,"when it comes to broth related winter foods, people can rave about hot pot or pho all they want but for me, there is nothing more satisfying than a delicious bowl oframen. the complex flavors and textures make for a near euphoric experience for anyone who enjoys a quality noodle soup. often ippudo yelp.com biz ippudonyn,a may get the nod for the city's most wellknownramen, but my taste buds deem totto as the best in manhattan.there are multiple totto locations but this original spot is where its at. the subtle decor and intimate ambiance screams japan all the way, from the narrow interior to the line of up staff behind the counter conversing in japanese. stripped of any major pretension or fancy digs, this adds to the experience, even if the food presides above all.the price to be paid however, is a wait. solo diners are encouraged to sit at the bar, while the date group of will typically get one of the tables resting along the wall. i've heard nightmare scenarios of hour waits and such, but coming here at the very beginning of dinner service or with an hour till they close have been my saving grace. most of the time i'm just walking right in.their signature totto spicyramen . is delightful. i tend to add char siu for my protein and begin slurping the broth with no addons nearly immediately upon receipt. the addition of corn and extra noodles is never a bad thing but if one is go fullramenglutton, then the megaramen . is a much better choice. there is also the paitanramen . with al dente noodles swimming wonderfully in a chicken based broth. it reminds me of a souped up version pun intended of chicken noodle soup, but with way better noodles.for our seafood lovers, the niboramen is another specialtyramenwith a fish flavored rayu but retaining all elements of the paiten for an added kick. veggie friends have their ownramenstock to slurp from, an originalvegetableramen . and a spicy version for a more. add ons could be anything from corn to extra pork, but any add on only adds to the complexity of the soup. i still cannot bring myself to order their seasoned avocado when it drowns and eventually melts, clouding the broth. extra noodles however, is almost a requirement on my end.another reason i love totto is their approach on char siu bbq pork . they marinate the meat before charring the outside of it blow torch style and the fatty bits only add to the flavor when mixed in with the broth. pork buns for are a bit of an after thought but the char siu mayo don . is delicious. the rice has an essence of the pork while the yuzu really gives the dish some real punch palate wise.the service does their best to accommodate substitutions and requests. they may not seem the most friendly based on having to deal with waiting customers on a daily basis, but show them some respect and they will in turn do the same. it is cash only and leave the friends at home. going solo or having a patient dining companion makes the experience a whole lot simpler."
444,Olivia R.,1115,4,1/12/16,"tottoramenis consistently great! i have had themisoramen, regularramen, andvegetableramenand love them all. thevegetableramenbroth is significantly lighter, but it is loaded withvegetables. compared to the otherramenit lacks flavor, but i love it! i always ask for the wavy noodles, i have never asked for the straight ones. the tuna don is excellent and a little spicy. i prefer the pork bun over the chicken bun it is more flavorful. i always ask for extra mayo also, just because it can be a little dry. overall the buns are juicy and good. the service is extremely quick so be prepared for a fast meal. they get you in and out! also, cash only!"
445,Martina L.,1115,3,1/7/16," degree weather on a clear night made me craveramenfor dinner! if you are looking for a quick meal then come by yourself, otherwise expect to wait in line. even though i arrived around there was already a long line, but since i was by myself the hostess took my order and seated me right way at the bar and my order came about minutes later. i got thevegetableramenand i gave it three stars because i wish the portion was bigger for the price some tofu or egg would be nice! , but otherwise i enjoyed the authentic taste and the overall efficiency was exactly what i needed for the night. it definitely keeps up with the fastpaced nyc vibe!"
446,Anisha R.,1115,5,11/19/17,"come winters and you will find me there every week! it is just so comforting to have a hot ramen being cooked right in front of you on a cold winter day! its hands down one of the best ramen places in the city. this place is not for you to hang out with friends you come, enjoy your food and leave, i think that is the idea. they are super busy , you will have to put names once you reach. the service is pretty fast so you will get your seats fast but even if you wait a bit trust me it is worth the wait. try thespicybambooshootsand the pork chicken bun. it is simply amazing. bring cash, they do not accept cards."
447,Jennifer T.,1115,5,3/24/17,"so totto. i love it here.i'm not here to get into the ippudo vs totto debate. both are swell but incomparable in my opinion.totto is chinese influenced japanese ramen, all chicken based. the broth is super creamy and opaque, like a chicken tonkotsu . every bowl here rules, both paitan and vegetable options. their rayu is off the hook. it is a place where you do not have to be subtle with what you put in your bowl.garlic paste bring it.spicybambooshootsthat are hot af where i need to rinse some of the peppers in my soup to eat them fantastic. you really get the opportunity to build up your soup here over time. which yes is probably only around minutes, people are hungry waiting outside to replace you.it is a tiny joint, cash only, in and out during rush hours which here seems to be every hour. but it is lively and your food comes out almost immediately.come alone, snag a seat at the counter. or come with a partner in crime, but any more than two people and you are in for a brutal wait. luckily you can get drunk around the corner at the countless bars littering th ave.however if you manage to snag a seat right before closing within reason at the counter you have the opportunity to get to know the staff and enjoy some sake together. at least from my experience. everyone is super friendly.also as a last note, they slice their scallions diagonally so it is easier to pick up with your chopsticks as you pick up your noodles. considerate."
448,Buffy M.,1115,5,4/23/16,"i wanted to go to totto ramen the last time i was in nyc, but did not make it. this time i took advantage of a beautiful nyc spring afternoon to walk over to totto ramen.they just opened, got a seat at the counter and watched it all happen. i got their basic ramen, with chicken, seasoned egg andspicybambooshoots. it so did not disappoint! this was some seriously good ramen!"
449,Wei T.,1115,4,9/27/15,"best ramen in mahattan. strongly recommend the extraspicychicken broth ramen! the sauce is on the side and super good edegea+aeae e ie pfrom japen , and must go with thespicybambooshoot!"
450,Apple L.,1115,2,7/7/15,do not understand why this place is this popular. their chicken soup is way too thick. egg is overboiled.spicybambooshootsis toospicyand has no other flavor.
451,Jonathan N.,1115,3,11/17/14,"come early! there was a line right as they opened that continued to get longer as time passed. we only had to wait for minutes since we got there a little after opening. the place is cramped and small but the turnaround time is not bad.pork buns meat was kind of chewy and the sauce was not great. this needed some hot sauce, but be careful they will charge you for it. i think ippudo's pork buns blows this place out of the water.the mega ramen is a superbowl of totto ramen with a lot of additions and more broth noodles. the noodles are al dente, which i love. the pork is not good and some pieces are tough. the broth is just okay and i did not like thespicybambooshoots.tottospicyramen similar to the mega, but served with some chili oil.the ramen here is okay and not something i would wait for. a lot of my friends compared this place to ippudo, but i think there is not even a slight competition. the flavor of ippudo is way better. i will probably not be back any time soon as there are many ramen places around. and there is also ippudo."
452,Thomas A.,1115,3,10/6/14,"i think too many people hyped this place up for me. i came here on a sunday night around . we put our names down, and we noticed a long line. the wait was approximately minutes.to expedite the service, some ppl who were waiting to be seated had their orders taken already.we were lucky enough to sit at the ramen bar, so we got to see the magic happen.i ordered the porkspicyramen, while she ordered the extraspicyramen. for mine, i ordered extra char siu, a seasoned egg, andspicybambooshoots.my bowl came out and it was missing the seasoned egg andspicybambooshoots. she ordered extra char siu, a seasoned egg, and regularbambooshoots. hers came with a full egg andspicybambooshootson the side. so in essence, the cooks gave her myspicybambooshootsand my egg! failthe ramen itself was eh whatever. i mean it was not mindblowing. the pork was yummy. i really loved the rayu spicyoil , you just need to make sure to mix it around the broth well enough st. it def offers a nice kick as i was sweating from the spice as well as the heat from the boiling water that was cooking the ramen in front of me.i felt like the service was kind of urging us to rush our meal and get out, but as the fatties we are, we ordered kae dama and dove into round of the ramen experience.the ramen the nd time around were more al dente st time was a bit overcooked .overall it is an okay spot, but i still prefer ippudo's akamaru modern. maybe i should come back here and try the miso ramen with some rayu. that should be a better comparison."
453,Carla Z.,1115,4,9/17/14,"elbow your way through the line, write your name on the clipboard & patiently wait to be seated in a super duper tiny hole in the ground then prepare your tummy for an amazing bowl of ramen.we started with the pork buns and these were delicious. surprising because they came out in about mins no joke . also got the seaweed salad. the totto version is super cold, fresh & surprisingly a little more acidic than normal not in a bad way .i also tried thespicytotto ramen with boiled egg & char siu pork. delicious fatty pork that is broiled and perfectly seasoned. the broth was delicious though i've had better . i think their broth lacks depth because it is chicken basedi love the broth at momofuku fyi. fortunately, the noodles were bouncy and executed well.if you are turned off by getting up close & personal with strangers do not come here. totto is very very intimate but i think that adds authenticity and charm.the only thing i do not like is that they charge you for things that are basic toppings i had to pay an extra dollar for a boiled egg. i also had to pay for thespicybambooshoots warning superspicy! "
454,Jeff K.,1115,4,8/7/14," . stars, i rounded up because of the food. it would be a solid stars, if it were not for the wait.this place is crazy. i came here with someone and the line was out the door. i went to put my name down on the list and found out the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. instead of leaving and coming back, we decided to wait. apparently if they call your number and you are not there, you have to put your name on the list again and you go to the back of the line. they need a better system.when my name was called, about an hour later, we were seated at a small table in the back. the restaurant is really small. there is a bar and a fair amount of tables, but everything is really crammed in.i ordered the miso ramen with an extra helping and an order ofspicybambooshoots. when you mix thespicybambooshootswith the miso ramen broth, it tastes pretty good. it adds a bit of spice to it. the ramen noodles were soft and chewy.the service was ok. the waiters were attentive and our waters were always filled."
455,Swaroop B.,1115,5,5/24/14,i had thespicyvegetarian ramen and i have to say this was the best ramen everrrr! perfect amount of spice and flavors.we even tookspicybambooshootson the side. amazing.this is a perfect hole in the wall kind of a place. mins wait was totally worth it!! will come again and again and again!
456,Yssa L.,1115,3,5/5/14,"after four failed attempts to try toto ramen finally had a chance to try it on my last day here in nyc. we got there around and on our surprised there is a line and no body told us that we need to put our names on the list, the place is so tiny like a small joint in asia. we sat by the bar we ordered three different ramens. i got the miso ramen with extra shredded pork, extra egg and extraspicybambooshoots. for appetizer we got unidon, the bomb! melt in your mouth uni! why three stars ! the pork its so hard, i want the melt in your mouth pork in my ramen. and there is nothing special on the noodles. for my next trip in nyc i will still go to the other ramen spot next street!"
457,James I.,1115,5,4/23/14,"i've neglected to give totto a proper review. yes, i've failed. i've eaten here once a week for the past months and simply have been focused on enjoying it rather than giving it props.simplicity is king here. this is hands down my favorite bowl of chicken broth based ramen. it is really something incredible with it is deep, rich flavor balanced by intermittent crunches of onion. this base has brought me back, week after week, like an addict. paitan for the win the best bowl of chicken soup you have ever had.their rayu spikedspicyramen builds upon the bowl of paitan with a variance on the aftertaste and a punch of heat. delicious, familiar, yet unique.the miso ramen is something way foreign to me. i've had it a few times. it really requires you to be in the mood for that nutty, fermented excursion. they use very high quality miso and this is the loudest bowl they make in my opinion. it is quite different than any other bowl of miso i've had yet. with all that said, it is not my favorite in the city momo . but regardless, i know it is there, waiting for me.the pork buns are solid. small yet pcked with flavors that i have not found anywhere else. their pork is so simple. but maybe that is just it. they have taken the time to figure out the simplest methods and deliver them almost flawlessly in one pork bun. definitely my top favorite pork buns in the city, probably sitting strong at # .the mega ramen. hahah! this is they are answer to the american portions that you really want. and yes, i caved and had myself a bowl. it is everything you want it to be. packed with all the usual pork suspects you desire, this one is for those days where a kaedama is not enough.the toppings are perfect. all of them. favs are the kikurage, corn, andspicybambooshoots. their egg is flawless. i'm getting hungry. i'm starting to shake!totto, i salute you!ps pm is the time to go at either location. go at , and you might be too late! pm lunch is also a fail safe time."
458,Vidhi B.,1115,4,1/23/14,"best ramen in the city.no kidding.but worth the + hour wait that people seem to be experiencing. .hell no. + reviews.there is nothing left to say that has not been said before.i had made few futile attempts to eat at totto ramen in the last few months.the wait time was killing and somehow i cannot bring myself to wait for hours for a bowl of noodles.during polar vertex hubby suggested we try going to totto ramen and hopefully not too many people would have had the same thought.he was right.our wait was less than minutes at . pm. we sat at the bar.i got thespicyvegetable ramen with thespicypaste on the side with the seasoned egg andspicybambooshootson the side and avo tuna.tuna was so rich and flavorful.the ramen was like no other i have had.i have not eaten at too many ramen places in the city, but last few years i have been travelling to hong kong and ramen is always my to go food there.the broth at tr is so creamy and rich that just the broth alone could be very satisfying.thespicybambooshootswere a total waste of money.we each had a piece and did not touch it after that.hubby got the pork buns and he loved themthe meal was so fulfilling and the taste tangled my taste buds for days after having dined here.its quite a treat sitting at the bar watching the ramen chefs cook.and as stephanie q said in her review this is not the place to chit chat and eat slowly.we were out of the place in less than minutes from the time we got seated.i could not bring myself to have the ice water in the sub zero degree weather and had to request for room temperature water three times to the server and finally got hold of another server who promptly brought it over.overall had a great meal and loved every bit of the ramen and its components.will be back."
459,Soup N.,1115,5,1/10/14,my favorite place in nyc. i've only been to new york twice in my life and the two times i've been i've eaten here. worth the wait. get thespicyramen and thespicybambooshoots! love it so much i bought a shirt!
460,Deoroop M.,1115,5,12/18/13,"after a long awaited journey, i finally trekked all the way to totto ramen to gorge upon the ramen of all ramens.blistering cold, snow, sleet and rain in the middle of the afternoon and yet, the foyer of totto was packed with angry, disgruntled customers. that is when i figured out this place is the real deal. having to wait a measly fifteen minutes because sadly i was dining for one , there was a target on my back because the wait list was not getting any shorter, i scurried in and quickly took my seat.it is quite and experience to see where and how all the magic happens and i think this is one of the most unique things about this place. totto ensures the customer that making and crafting ramen is not just a streamline process but it is truly an art that gives birth to a scrumptious, hot piping soup to be enjoyed by all walks of life.the chicken ramen was my optimal choice. word to the wise, extra addons are a must. since i was a novice, thebambooshootsand seasoned boiled egg were the only options i chose. next time, thespicybambooshootswill be my victim. chicken broth, simply exquisite and it was the perfect dish to power me through a brutal, wintry day. the ramen was perfectly cooked and neither too soft or too chewy, just the right consistency. could have used a few extra slivers of chicken to compliment my ramen but i guess that is why they have addons for a reason. regardless of that fact, is was still a very filling meal.totto ramen, you have truly outdone yourself. you deserve to be hailed as a master among all ramens and gladly submit to your each and every will."
461,Nicole S.,1115,4,12/6/13,"if you ask someone about ramen in new york, two names usually come to mind ippudo and totto. being that we gave ippudo a try last visit, it was now totto's turn.i went with the tottospicyramen. i'm not usually a fan of straight ramen noodles, but their homemade noodles were good. their special paitan chicken broth was delicious! it was garlicky, creamy and extremely comforting for that day's cold weather. to make the dishspicy, they add aspicysesame oil which gives the broth an even deeper flavor. the ramen is topped off with scallion, cha siu pork, a handful of bean sprouts and a piece of nori.additional toppings are available to add to your noodles such as corn, avocado, and chicken. i'm a big fan of mushrooms so i added kikurage mushrooms. i addedspicybambooshoots, but that came on a separate plate. thebambooshootswere covered in a hot chili powder which did not give it much of a taste.my totto vs. ippudo verdict i would go back to both of them. both are delicious. totto will fill you up with their generous amount of noodles and toppings, but my stomach favors ippudo's broth.service such fast turnaround! we were asked what we wanted within a few minutes of sitting down. thank goodness i looked at the menu online the night before, but i panicked and forgot to add an egg. our bowls probably came out within about minutes of us ordering.shoutout to the worker calling out names on the list. he kept my friend and i entertained with his side comments.and lol at him pronouncing the name phoebe as fayohbee .what to know cash only chicken or vegetarian broth sign your name on the list. many people get discouraged about the wait and end up leaving. do not be that person who thinks they have an hour to roam the street and ends up getting their name called while they are gone. expect to wait. we waited about minutes on friday afternoon. it is a small place. do not come with a large group."
462,Jamie C.,1115,4,12/2/13,"imo, far better than ippudu around the corner! totto ramen has become one our favorite spots in our neighborhood walkable distance too! try to avoid coming in the weekends it is almost a sure shot it is packed with tourist trying to get a taste if their mouth watering delicious goodness of a chicken broth soup! if you have no other option but to come on a weekend, make sure you get there before pm. otherwise is a guaranteed minimum of a hour wait time. good thing there are many bars within the vicinity! i would suggest to put your name down, and go around the corner to have a beer or a shot! it will keep you warmer during the cold nyc winters. i would not recommend chilling at the bar for more than mins depending on how many people are in the waiting list before you, cuz if you are not present when they call your name your name is crossed off for good and.it is back if the line for ya buddy! yes, unfortunately this has happened to me. i usually order the extraspicytotto ramen . it is just called extraspicycuz they give you a side of their special totto ramen garlic and chili oil hot because. imo, it is really not thatspicy. you can still enjoy your ramen. and on the nights i'm looking for an extra kick in the mouth of flamingspicygoodness, i ask the server for thespicyred chili flakes. so delicious!! some favorited add ons of mine would include thespicybambooshoots additional , soft boiled egg additional , and cooked to perfection on most days , and the corn . the ramen is comes with a piece of nori japanese dried seaweed , generous portions of thinly sliced scallions, and plenty of cooked bean spouts that add some dimension to your ramen experience.the noodles more thin than typical ramen joints, but the texture is chewy at first but as you work your way through the bottom of the bowl it is basically perfect to the last drop of soup. never too soggy! which is a surprise and difficult to achieve in most ramen spots.the soup not too salty normally. the only thing i would have to complain about of their consistency of the soup. some days it seems over cooked as the broth seems super thick and on this days taste substantially more salty. the broth made from chicken instead of the typical pork broth. so that is definitely something worth trying!meat selection your choice or either slices of char sui roasted pork or slices of chicken breast.overall, the staff are friendly and attentive. it is definitely one of the favorites since i've moved to manhattan!"
463,Sandy C.,1115,3,10/14/13,"oh geez, i'm probably going to get stoned by ramen aficionados.but here's my paltry two cents it was all right. the noodles were nice and leggy and springy. thespicybroth and the miso one were decent. i think it is cool that they blow torch the pork. and the egg is superbly marinated with shoyu, mirin, and brown sugar.it just did not all meld for me. i felt like thespicywas just a slick of chili oil on top instead of integrated into the broth i needed a side ofspicybambooshootsto give it a real kick . and the temperature of the egg was nowhere close to the broth so the contrast was kinda jarring and failed to highlight the unctuous ooziness of the yolk.maybe my expectations were too high. after all, i would read the reviews and got there min before opening to ensure i got one of the first seats at the bar for a weekday lunch note once you are min out, people start to descend . so maybe my anxiety euphoria at beating the line just set me up for hype fatigue. the cooks behind the bar are pretty badass though. i would go again to check out their show, cluck my tongue in sympathy at the long line outside, enjoy a decent bowl of noodles, and get cramped up in the america's most miniscule bathroom hard to beat that fun package deal."
464,Michelle T.,1111,4,1/13/17,"one of my favorite steakhouse in nyc. i came here during restaurant week and it was so worth it. we started off with crab cakes that tasted fresh and had a wonderful texture. the steak is so juicy and has lots of flavors. then, we finished it off with their signature dessert baked alaska. the staffs were very friendly. it is a nice romantic elegant place for a date night. overall, i will be coming back again regardless of restaurant week deal or not."

470,Kenji A.,1111,5,2/13/18,"honestly, our best meal in ny. we took advantage of the restaurant week dinner menu, and it was so worth it. we did not know much about the restaurant, the d ] c cor made me go and research as we waited for our meal. the history that surrounds the place, you can feel it i almost wish there was a little history book i could have flipped through at the table. our server and the bussers were fantastic my water glass was never empty and i drink water like a camel. filet mignon and the potatoes that accompanied it was perfect not too rich and the steak had the right searing on it. the cheesecake at the end was the right size and taste was bar none to any cheesecake i had in ny. price point was just about the same as any restaurant for a steak dinner . going during restaurant week just made it that much more of a value. we definitely intend to go back the next time we are in ny."

472,Michelle L.,1111,2,9/14/16,"i have a lot of up and down opinions on this place but unfortunately the downs won. in regards to the restaurant, it is quite large with a beautiful, old american steakhouse vibe in relation to the initial entrance of the restaurant. we were seated deeper into the restaurant, past the bar in what seemed to be annex from the main, slightly more plain compared to the initial look of the restaurant.we were a group of and overall, the food was meh compared to other steakhouses i have tried. we started off with the bacon and although the portion size was adequate, the cuts given were a mismatch. i got a piece just of pure fat that never should have made it on the plate. flavoring was there but became a let down with the overwhelming fat. then the sides and main entr ] c e came. we shared the asparagus, hash browns and mushrooms. sides were good and enough to share between people. they were on par with expectations so that was nice.for my main entr ] c e, i shared the porterhouse for two, asking for medium rare. we unfortunately got rare. like super rare. i like bloody red meat but when i request for medium rare at a respected steakhouse, i want to see what i ordered. it was so rare i almost could not swallow but had to consider the amount of money i was shelling out. the filet was buttery and soft and the strip had good flavor. unfortunately, the execution was not there and coupled with my bacon mishap, i was not pleased. combine the bad service and the whole dinner experience became a flat two stars. our service was so slow and we were constantly trying to flag them down to reorder wine bottles and request for more iced water. i almost wanted to just ask them to leave the pitcher of water at the rate we were getting refills. there was no attention paid to us and it took forever just to get their attention to ask for the check.with the painstakingly poor service and food just being average below average compared to other expensive steakhouses i have had , i was quite disappointed with this experience."

474,Ji T.,1111,5,1/28/18,"if you are in town and want to try out the delmonico steak or many other dishes that were famously originally created from the oldest restaurant in america, you must rsvp via opentable at least a day ahead. there is also a bar section and its own entrance. the delmonico steak itself does not come with any sides, i highly recommend my creamed spinach because you want to morally feel healthy when you are chowing down on a thick slab of cow."
475,David P.,1111,5,3/17/18,"best steak i have had in my life. the atmosphere is great, as well as the service there. the steaks are bigger than i expected. my wife and i definitely will be going back!"
476,Mohsin R.,1111,5,2/17/18,i can see why this place has been around for years! the steak was perfect all the way through and the char was splendid! the king crab mac n cheese was amazing and the creaminess complimented the steak perfectly!
477,Rebecca L.,1111,3,8/28/16,"delmonico's offers a nice upscale dining experience with attentive and friendly service, however, i was not very impressed with the food. i came here this summer and ordered off the restaurant week dinner menu. i ordered the lobster newberg, filet mignon, and the cheesecake. the lobster newberg was a nice unique appetizer, however the filet mignon was a little bland and soggy in texture. the bread basket was soft and chewy on the inside but a little too tough on the outside. the cheese cake was warm and creamy."
478,Kool M.,1111,3,2/8/18,"a new york institution, an icon. one of the first real restaurants in america. recently restored, do they rest on their laurels, definitely. however, it is the place where lobster newburg and baked alaska was created."
479,Eugene K.,1111,5,6/6/18,"excellent steak and sides. even better service, which is becoming rare in nyc. the manager came around several times asking how everything is going. they do not just ask they actually care about the impression that you walk away with. it is a little on the expensive side, but you come for the experience, the history, and then the food. a remnant of a time when fine dining meant something on a wholly different level."
480,Sara W.,1111,4,9/28/16,"delmonico's is an institution in the financial district. it has a beautiful oldworld steakhouse vibe with it is lacquered woodwork and it is crisp white linens. the entrance i came in takes you into the bar cafe which is suppose to be the cheaper section to eat in . bar is large and square shaped sitting in the middle of the room. past that are two separate dining rooms, one is about the same size as the room with the bar, and the other is a large dining room. we ate at a table near the bar.we ordered calamari, chips with guacamole and an entree. appetizers were really tasty. calamari was cooked perfectly, seasoned nicely and had a nice chipotle mayo dipping sauce. chips and guac were what you would expect, good, but nothing spectacular. for my lunch i had a burger which was delicious. cooked and seasoned to perfection i literally have no complaints on the food. service was great, exactly what you would expect for delmonico's, the biggest issue i have is with the price. delmonico's is extremely expensive so i never go out of my way to go there, but they are catering to a specific audience and i understand that. only other complaint i have is that the menu is pretty dated. we are living in the golden age of food so although customers expect the food to taste amazing and it should for what they charge we are also tired of seeing the same old menu and want new and exciting food to try."
481,Sarah M.,1111,4,12/20/16,"we usually just go to the grill area, and i'm a fan. service is just as good as in the restaurant and they make awesome burgers.my one complaint is that my last burger was definitely not medium rare but it was so juicy i survived."
482,Seunghwan J.,1111,3,2/28/18,"as what it is known for, delmonico's steak is between good and great. at least, you would not be disappointed if you are looking for a good quality beef cooked in moderately gourmet style.i tried delmonico classic bone in day dry aged steak during nyc restaurant week and it was better than i expected. the steak was well seasoned and came out to be perfect medium rare as requested. it was worth the price regarding how most restaurants fail to even get the order right these days.nothing so special about maplebrook farm burrata. it was just regular salad. the presentation was great. i wish i had taken a picture of it.let us talk about the desserts. both dark chocolate mousse cake and new york style cheesecake are beyond great. they are one of the best desserts i had throughout my foodie journey. mousse cake had that crunch layer at the top and it was delicately soft inside. most importantly, it perfectly captured the correct sweetness required to not bore your palate and maintain consistency. i would say the cheesecake was amazing as well. what is so great about their desserts is that they are not too sweet and not too blend.there is one problem with this restaurant their services. staffs are not really motivated to work. i could feel their frustration and annoyance.while food is the most important part in restaurant review, services are also part of it. they need to train their servers better."
483,Kenny C.,1111,3,8/20/15,"i would been to delmonico's kitchen in midtown before worked in the same building but never made it out to the historic original in fidi. well, estaurant week provided the perfect excuse!their rw was pretty ridiculous, and not in a good way. nearly everything had a supplementary cost, and if you wanted to stick to the dinner, you only had a handful of choices. that said, they had a lot of their standards on the list, so it was still a decent way to try the bucket list items.as an appetizer, we did the oysters, which were fine. we got the west coast selection, but they did not bother letting us know where they were from. red flag maybe. but they were fresh enough.for a starter, i had their famous lobster newberg which was a supplement . i have to say, it was a hefty portion of basically half a lobster. the sauce was creamy and rich, but sparse so it was not overly heavy. definitely worth trying as a starter, but i do not know if i could handle a whole entree of it.for my main, i had the grilled filet mignon. it was okay, but i've had better cuts elsewhere even in their midtown location . no doubt they were saving some choice cuts for restaurant week. either that, or it was just overrated.also tried the chicken a la keene, which is another signature dish of theirs, and that was highly disappointing. the chicken was way overcooked and dry as all hell. maybe a bad example because they are not used to cooking rw portions either that, or it just sucked.for dessert, i had the dark chocolate mousse cake, which had a nice salted caramel sauce. thought it was fine, but nothing extraordinary.the baked alaska, on the other hand, was both beautiful and so, so heavy. i get that baked alaskas take some amount of work, but for a supplement, they should have just made it smaller and more manageable. two people could have shared it. oh well, the walnut cake and banana gelato was tasty though.they also had a house montepulciano d'abruzzo my favorite red wine , which was surprisingly good for just a bottle during rw. yum.one last thing we had a reservation a few weeks in advance and were seated in the room downstairs in the dickens alcove . i'm not saying they were seating all the minorities together, but. there were only two tables of white people downstairs one of which was a large group , and upstairs was all white people. maybe it is a dress code thing, or maybe it is because they did not want rwers to take up valuable space upstairs, or maybe they just do not like people who book on open table. i do not know and i will let you draw your own conclusions, but when they start surrounding your table with asian tourists, you get the hint."
484,Samantha L.,1111,5,7/7/17,the ambiance was amazing the food was great and the staff was so nice. it was a short wait to be seated. the waiter was very attentive. the food came in a decent amount of time. i had the calamari to start. my only issue with it was the soppressata it mad the calamari taste a bit too much on the saltier side but the crunch was great and the meat was moist and the flavors were spot on. the steak was cook beautifully. a nice medium and well crusted.
485,Jessica L.,1111,2,8/1/16,"came here for restaurant week and got the seasonal soup gazpacho , petit filet mignon, and baked alaska supplement . obviously the restaurant itself is beautiful with outstanding decorations, but i've got to say i've had better steak. i'm not sure if it was because it was restaurant week and maybe they are using lower quality meats, but the filet mignon was dry and not very tender i did order medium rare and it looked medium rare, which confused me more . maybe i should have tried a different steak, but the others were a supplemental charge, which negates the worth of restaurant week. also, the baked alaska was not as phenomenal as expected it was a bit heavy and very fragrant. i would go with the chocolate mousse the next time."
486,Hilary L.,1111,5,8/24/16,came here for restaurant week with friends and we had a wonderful time! the food was alright despite the price tag on them. i was more fascinated with the history behind the restaurant than my dinner.
487,Gourmand M.,1111,4,8/14/17,"yes, it is a good steakhouse with good dishes but not the best. yes, delmonico's cut is a legend but they have been taking advantage of the name and history."
488,Daniel C.,1111,5,2/20/18,great traditional dinner. steak was super nice and priced reasonably. service is awesome.
489,Callie C.,1111,5,2/11/18,"my boyfriend and i went for restaurant week and it was lovely! for the value of the meal, the portions were smaller than what i would imagine they normally are but it was worth paying for the meal at a fraction of the price. our server was very attentive and we were placed in a separate room so our date was much more intimate. i also made our reservation on the opentable app and checked off that it was my birthday and my dessert came with a candle! they really went above and beyond with the service."
490,Shannon B.,1111,5,7/2/17,"this was the absolute best restaurant i have ever been to. and for me to say that is really crazy. my dad came to nyc to visit me, so i though it would be cool to take him to the oldest steakhouse un nyc. the look and feel is obviously old school nyc which is just fun because you do not ever see that anymore but let us get to the food. we started off with the crab newberg and holy cow one of the best things one ever tasted. absolutely unreal. we also had the tuna tartare and that was heavenly. i did not think it could get any better until my chicken arrived and yeah it was amazing which was not surprising. i also had the creamed spinach. i am actually coming back in weeks with my friends who are visiting and i am so excited!"
491,Kevin J.,1111,4,10/19/16,ambience was awesome. a friend of mind took me out for a late birthday dinner.the steak was great and the spinach sides was amazing. too bad we did not pair it with the wine.
492,Michael B.,1111,3,11/4/16,there classic delmonico steak was good but was not overly impressed by the rest of the meal. very pricey and i am not one to complain. hostess was not dressed for the caliber of clients. food was good atmosphere excellent i would have given stars if the details were paid attention too.
493,Christina M.,1111,2,11/2/17,disappointed. to be fair the quality of the food was very good but besides that service was subpar and the ladie's restrooms at the rest stop on the nj parkway are by far up to better standards. attentive service was nonexistent. after the server explained that they pool their tips together it made more sense. one of the two women's stalls was a mess with a clogged toilet and neither had toilet paper. i would have expected way more for a meal. save your time and money and eat elsewhere!!
494,Pamela L.,1111,1,10/10/18,"although i had a confirmed reservation for delmonico's for weeks, they called three days before to tell me i could only sit in the basement because they booked a large party. guess i'm never giving them a second chance. i also guess my money was not big enough for them."
495,Fred G.,1111,1,9/15/18,"i have eaten here many times. this time the flies were everywhere. little little flies while i was eating. such a classy restaurant with great staff, why do they have fruit flies it do not make sence"
496,Derian C.,1111,1,8/23/18,i was mistreated by the manager staff at delmonicos steakhouse when i ordered food from the bar. i was asked for collateral in order to have my food. their was bartenders serving me for some odd reason. well the manager did not serve me she just wanted to confirm my order and take my card. i told the first server what i wanted to eat and after i told her the manager came to confirm my order and asked for my card after getting my order. she said it is busy tonight so i'm going to need your card . mind you it was not busy at the bar and it is still a abhorrent excuse because i'm staying at the bar. at that moment i got a weird feeling in my stomach after i was asked for my card to eat at the bar. minutes later a caucasian gentleman walks in and sit right next to me and makes a order.no collateral was asked from the gentleman and my blood started to boil. so after my appetizer i asked to pay my bill because i felt immensely uncomfortable and just disgusted after such foul treatment. the first bar tender that took my order who served my food offered me a free drink to stay after i explained to her what is going on in my head right now because she knew it was wrong. then she begged me not to leave for like minutes and to just eat the steak or have it to go. i felt so embarrassed and confused like what did i do to be mistreated like this.i've sent a email and wrote a message on their site about what happened. because i'm still very upset with more details.
497,Amirali S.,1111,1,6/22/18,"one the worst services i got at this level of restaurants.it is just a name and the staff did not behaved well and rude.do not recommend it it at allafter spent for , we deserve more."
498,Katie F.,1111,1,5/23/18,worst service ever. manager is a total jerk. screwed up our meals twice and overheard manager saying do not give them anything free they are tourists . do not go here.
499,Deb S.,1111,1,5/15/18,tired old men serving tired old banquet food and a wait staff that thinks they are doing you a favor. save your money. strike off your bucket list. the most overpriced worthless meal ever.
500,Ali M.,1111,1,1/28/18,"too bad i missed the review about the roaches before i went or i would not have the opportunity to write this review today.i am not certain how this place has so many awesome reviews based upon my most recent experience. it is very well possible that i personally expect a higher degree towards excellence if i am dining at an establishment well known over the years for top quality food service delivery. i was disappointed with my first and last visit to this restaurant. my main gripe with this place is the temperature of the food. if i order braised short ribs i expect the dish to come with a temperature rivaling hot or at least close to just coming out of the oven . unfortunately, it was not and neither were the rest of the dishes presented to our table of four. after a thoroughly disappointing meal for all of us we decided to order the absolute worst dessert in the history of desserts not to die for.the baked alaska. wow! was it gross. the banana flavored cake with gritty hard frozen vanilla ice cream and the scorched fluff exterior made for a dessert not worth tasting. power to all of the people that dine here for the status because that must be the only reason to frequent a dungeon like this. shame on you delmonico for ripping people off over years. everyone should do themselves a favor and if you go to the restaurant and do not like the food make sure to let the server know. it is apparent that no one in the kitchen either cares or is aware of the atrocities leaving the cooktop. thumbs down all around!meals all of them are over priced but these are the main dishes we haddelmonico signature steaknot warm but tender. had better elsewheredelmonico potatoesworth a try, but who comes to a steakhouse only for potatoes lamb chopsthis is better at texas de brazil at any location you can find and it is endless when you go there. can someone from delmonico's go taste this item at a restaurant that knows how this should be done braised short ribi had better during a demonstrative speech in college when someone brought to class in a bucket. not a good dish at delmonico's by any means. i have been to a number of fine dining establishments and this one is my top worst on the list so far "
501,Elif K.,1111,1,11/18/17,"very disappointed with the level of service and disrespectfulness we received last night. this is really not a classy establishment as advertised. i got yelled at by a bartender and our waiter was nothing short of snotty and disrespectful.we were directed to the bar to have a drink while waiting for our table. bar grill area was very crowded and two bartenders behind the bar were clearly overwhelmed. after waiting for solid mins for the bartender fill drink tickets, my vodka soda came out with a very big dose of attitude from the bartender. when i asked to see the wine list for a glass and delmonico's does not have one online , bartender yelled at me for not having my full order ready. then not to mention waiting additional mins to close my tab.when seated i asked our waiter if they had a sommelier that night. he said no and tried to upsell wines that he actually was not very knowledgable about i am a certified sommelier myself . we were very bothered by his snotty attitude and such low level of service, that we had to excuse ourselves and leave before ordering anything. sad how they treat customers who are clearly willing to generously spend money on good food and wine and want to have a pleasant experience."
502,Yuk C.,1111,1,11/3/17,"what a disappointment to this beautiful restaurant. we came here with a group of on saturday night for some quality meats.cons about an hour ticket time for apps and entrees. inconsistency in temperature. i ordered my steak medium rare and got black and blue. another friend ordered it medium and got rare. crispy onions was stale on other all other steaks. i confronted the waiter if they forgot the orders and rushed out the two steaks which were under cooked. he denied the fact, but i guaranteed that was the case. i do not really like the spit special so i did not send it back. at least the manager comped us a free round of drinks. the cook on hot grill that night should go back to the cold apps line.pros lobster newburg. i will give that stars alone, but there is no excuse for messing up the temperature on a steak.tip still gave %, but there are better steakhouses in nyc double eagle, even lugers,. "
503,Rochelle W.,1111,1,10/14/17,"most incredibly disappointing dining experience. i'm not sure if this restaurant has changed owners mgmt chef recently but the whole experience was awful. starting from the lobster bisque that tasted like beef, not anything like lobster and was luke warm. then the steaks were cooked perfectly, but tasted like pure salt blocks. the bearnaise sauce was cold and the fried onion garnish was ice cold and tasted stale. the manager came over to mansplain to us that in this restaurant, bearnaise sauce is always served cold and the onions were purely meant to be garnish. as such they are cooked earlier and served cold. in this case they were clearly cooked weeks ago. so poor all around. do not waste your time here. this used to be a gem, but sadly is now a dud."
504,Christine K.,1111,1,9/23/17,"i really looked forward to my first time at this old new york establishment. unfortunately things did not go as planned for my partner and i the menus vary between a pub area and a more formal space, as does the ambience, evidently. the main dining room was half empty on a saturday night, and while you think that would make for a lucky coincidence and a quieter atmosphere, it was actually a little depressing. there were a lot of staff members standing around not doing much, so despite a dining area full of wait staff, the service was slow. the waiter assisting my partner and i said a few rude and dismissive words to us in response to a question we asked about the menu when we first arrived. ultimately, the poor service spoiled the night. we ordered an appetizer and then went to a different restaurant nearby. it is too bad it did not seem anything like the place that mark twain and abraham lincoln once enjoyed."
505,Minjun K.,1111,1,5/9/17,"i would give stars for its exterior & interior view and services, but the food is way too salty for my appetite. even the grilled broccoli, which i expected to be light, was also very salty. if it was not salty, i would give stars for all of its food, service, and interior & exterior."
506,D M.,1111,1,4/14/17,food was fine but was overlooked because the service was so bad and unattentive. waiter paid a lot more attention to the table next to us for some reason. did not even tell us the specials but he told the other table . i hate to think people are still racist in in nyc but i cannot think of another reason for this singled out treatment.
507,Lukalvin P.,1111,1,11/12/16,no point. food are bland and waiter was rushing to have me sign off the tab! i would not recommend to dine here at all!
508,Gustavo S.,1111,1,11/12/16,"simply in one word boring.forget all the words you would associate with a steakhouse like luxurious, decadent, rich.this place is more closer to boring, plain, flat, tasteless, bland. you are much better of eating on outback for a third of the price and triple the flavor.from the apps to the steak, to the desert nothing had a single bit of flavor. seems like everything is just cooked in water.the service is just ok, nothing over the top and i felt most of the time you are rushed to finish and leave.new york has some amazing steakhouses from the simples to the fancier, do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
509,Tina Z.,1111,1,7/28/16,cannot recommend! salty food. service was not good at all either. not even once they check on us if we need anything. everything was very mediocre. i like the history of the place so one star for the history although we have museum for that i guess 
510,Usman A.,1111,1,7/1/16,"do not get old fashioned ,they use house rye! make sure you specify which rye you want in it"
511,Meredith Q.,1111,1,2/3/16,"my server who tall,white,young guy never attended my table. we waited over minutes after desert done. he just passed my table many times, and talked with other servers and laughing. in front of pos monitor, they just staying around there, talking and laughing. i had to call him for check. i have no idea with their service!! i felt like he does not care that much than other tables because we ordered restaurant week menu i really disappointed with that kind of service. if you want to look down your customers, do not add restaurant week menu please!!we are not cheap people and we just want to try your things in a chance. in the future, if i need to choose the fancy and delicious restaurant for big group it means big money for you guys, huh it will be not delmonico's.never come back! never recommend my friends also. one of guy who wearing black shirts, he was a only person who take care my table. i'm pretty sure that he is back server. i wanted to give tip him only. but i paid % tip also for your service. "
512,Miss C.,1111,1,1/29/16,underwhelming. shrimp tastes like bleach. service awesome though. the wine list left a lot to be desired. i expected better from this place.
513,Kim M.,1111,1,1/21/16,"what a disappointment. glorified cafeteria food. everything came out way too fast, food quality extremely sub par. overall our experience was not worth ever coming back for!"
514,Dave E.,1111,1,1/7/16,very disappointing.the house delmonico was the fattiest steak i've ever been served in a high end steak house. service was outstanding though as should be expected at these prices. risotto was well prepared shrimp was excellent. all in all a good bucket list check off but will not be back
515,Brad P.,1111,1,12/20/15,"possibly the worst i've ever spent. if i could give the restaurant stars i would certainly do it. the delmonico steak was over done and flavored like a sizzler special. it would barely rate as a ribeye. in fact, i would hesitantly give the steak to my maltipoo. i had to send the steak back after version number one was charred to a crisp, then then second version was barely better. the delmonico potatoes tasted like they were from a box. terrible. my wife characterized the restaurant perfectly. it is a new york staple that is famous, to a degree, and is kept in business by ignorant tourists i.e. me. you would be much better served at a chain morton's, ruth's chris, or flemings than this joint. if you have made reservations change them now."
516,Bella B.,1111,1,9/16/15,went in to try out their bar only to be treated flippantly by the sullen almost irritable bartender. she obviously has aspirations of eventually heading to her true calling elsewhere since her flat personality and disdain for the clientele was palpable. will not be coming back here and do not recommend it.
517,S. W.,1111,1,8/13/15,"beautiful restaurant! but stay away during restaurant week.upon checking in & glancing at the historic dining room, we were shuttled down to a musky, dank basement dining room where other restaurant week folks were.table setting upon seating, burgundy rimmed charger & wine glass laced with faint grease fingerprints.menu note upcharge items not worth orderingappetizer gulf shrimp risotto of us ordered this & presented with a consistently gooey, thick, microwaved warm glob of oatmeal consistency paste with one dull warm medium size shrimp. very unappetizing presentation.chef's chilled soup presentation gazpacho souptasted like tomatoes only & represented none of what this soup should have tasted like.wedge salad not served ice cold as it should be, other then that, its salad.delmonico's blue crabcake supplement made with ingredients that never merged nor added to the flavor of this single bite size crabcake.entrees grilled filet mignon w. chef's seasonal vegetable preparation of us ordered this. it was served on a small dollop of warm, dull, gooey pasted, mashed potato with luke warm tasteless string beans. the meat was ok, not sizzling hot when served and of us ate only the food.overnight barbecued short rib it tasted like it was left out overnight, my 'not' picky eater friend was so turned off, he did not finish this meal. meat was dry and rubbery. the description in menu sounded better than what was actually served.conclusion everything was served with a dull glazing over the meal, like it sat around for a long time before being served. no entrees were served piping hot. flies were circling our food.dessert dark chocolate mousse cake, salted caramel sauce ordered this & was eaten. tiny teaspoon of sauce provided, nothing impressive to rave of.classic baked alaskasupplement not worth it! this was horrible! of us ordered this warm plasticky tasting, burned meringue which overwhelmed the small piece of room temperature walnut cake & iced banana gelato. the ingredient combination did not merge well. we ate each item separately as each had a different texture & did not cut down smoothly with the fork. to their credit, the gelato was good, i rather it served alone. of this was left on the plate, no one wanted to eat this.new york style cheesecake, strawberry compote one ordered this. unlike description, it tasted like sour blackberry topping with no complexity nor spice, cheesecake was nothing remarkable.service nothing remarkable, the waiter gave us the bill before we asked & told us gratuities were already added, we never saw him again for any services afterwards.overall if restaurant week was meant to introduce restaurants in hopes of normal patronage, this one failed at its intent! for a grand, classy restaurant, food was subpar & not even worth . flies were a big turnoff as they laced our entrees & desserts. the smell of the basement was another turnoff. had our friends from out of town were not there, we would have made immediate complaints. the food, table setting, service and seating made it an embarrassing evening for us & we will never consider this restaurant for any occasion in the future. buyer be warned!"
518,Katherine R.,1111,1,7/18/15,"beautiful place, amazing hostess but the worst service. the fact that you cannot accommodate your customers requests to order a burger in the main dining area and require them to move to the bar is completely unacceptable. i do understand if there are two different menus, but when you have a group that wants to order steaks, oysters and burgers there should be an exception. i looked forward to this dining experience and was appalled with the way the waiter treated my party. when we requested to speak with the manager we were told first he is having dinner with his family and does not want to be disturbed. seriously then go home and be with your family, there are plenty of hard working people in this city that would love your job."
519,Will N.,1111,1,3/25/15,nothing wrong with the service. but the food is really quite pathetic. the feeling of the restaurant is of a hotel bar. it is gross and weak. my steak was flat and grey. go to harry's down the block.
520,Keith W.,1111,1,1/22/15,"delmonico where to start. i was really underwhelmed. we expected a lot more from the waiters, service, and the food at such a high dollar and well known restaurant.the food oysters were fine, not the best, not the worst i've had. we both had steaks, one filet and one agebone in ribeye. the steaks were cooked well but the cut of beef was average at best. side note on my review i come from cattle country, so granted i may be a bit harsher critic than others, i know what a good steak should taste like.for a claimed day dry aged ribeye and day wet aged filet these were some very unflavorful cuts of meat. i suspect they do not age their own beef, as a high end restaurant should, they probably just buy it from a food vendor. the steaks were cooked properly, but for the price they are charging there is no excuse for this lack of taste.sides were not great, i would not recommend the asparagus or mashed potatos that we tried, both were below par.the service they never came by to cheek on the meal or to offer us additional drinks until the very end of the meal. very subpar. for a restaurant like this you should have at least two waiters, a lead and assistant checking on you, brushing crumbs off the table, folding your napkin when you leave your seat, and making sure your needs are met. instead the waitors felt content to talk with each other off in the corner and came by at the end of every course to see how it was. minutes after i get my steak, asking if it is cooked properly is unacceptable. letting us run out of bread unacceptable. letting our drinks run out, unacceptable. plus the other items i mentioned above.secondly, they are known for their wine selection. however, i was in a craft beer and cocktail mood. i asked the server for the beer list, which he recited to me. they all were lake and burger beers, budlight, coors, etc. perfect for burgers, but embarrassing they did not have a large selection of craft beers for a meal. asked him if he had any local beers, to which he replied blue moon. blue moon is made in colorado, not new york . then i asked for a moscow mule and if they had copper mugs. they did not have copper mugs, and he and his assistant did not know what a moscow mule even was. poor training of the wait staff on drinks, and poor craft beer selection. seems the staff were all there to collect a payday off the expensive food and lacked proper training.delmonico i expected much more of you."
521,Jessica R.,1111,1,1/15/14,"this review is for the grill only.the woman bartender is waaaaay too aggressive for lunch time. there were maybe people at the bar, place was not busy at all and she was running around, like she was swamped. i was a bartender for a long time, she was just a mess. she never made eye contact and it took forever to get her attention. she seemed so high stung and nervous it made me uncomfortable to even enjoy myself there and relax. she was eating behind the bar and drinking wine. sorry, if you need to eat fine, but take a break and leave the bar, i do not need to see you shoving things in your mouth with your hands then handling my food. the only people she seemed to care about were the two alcoholics at the bar whom were gross and talking trash so loudly i had to move seats. she asked if i was ok when i moved and i said yea, it was just a little loud. her response well, it is a bar. do you want a table umm no rude, i can handle a loud bar just not a drunk, whom you keep pouring more and more wine for, slurring at the top of his lungs about really disgusting stuff. seriously, bad for business.the food was ok. started with the hand rolled mozzarella sticks. they were too doughy. then i had the cheesesteak. it was nothing to write home about. i came especially for it and i have no desire to get it again. the bread seemed stale, there was not enough onions and the meat did not have enough cheese. just an uneven ratio.it is disappointing because i really like the actual restaurant."
522,Molls M.,1111,1,8/27/13,i've been here multiple times and usually it is very good however tonight was a major disappoitnment! if you are okay with your waitress doing multiple shots throughout the night which you can clearly witness. much less the gm also drinking and stumbling around dinking and turning the music louder and louder to a point where i was begging the waitress to bring us the check however she was so wasted to took awhile. all that said when our steak came out it was smothered with an awful homemade a sauce that was not listed on the menu. i do not know about you but when my dollar steak comes out with an unadvertised sweet awful bbq sauce on it i am disappointed to say the least. if you are a true steak enthusiast then i do not recommend you go here. which is a true shame since this establishment used to be the best steak house in manhattan. not anymore.
523,Anne R.,1111,1,7/18/13,"our meal and our dining experience were totally ruined by one of your longerterm waiters.on june , we made an email reservation to dine at delmonico's on june for pm at beaver st., ny.as this was our first time at delmonicos, we asked the waiter to suggest a wine he refused. but his reply was, you have a wine list, choose for yourself . obviously, his reply did not sit very well with me. however, because i was entertaining my wife and a guest, i did not address the waiter's arrogance.we then ordered appetizers. however it took forever to arrive since his main focus was on another table and completely ignoring us. when we ordered the main course, and the steak dinner arrived, one mediumwell steaks was extremely rare and rubbery. so we asked the waiter to please provide my guest with the steak as ordered. but to our surprise, your waiter created such a loud spectacle that the rest of the restaurant patrons had no choice but to hear and stare at us. however, because it was supposed to be a special occasion for my wife and my guest, i kept my composure to not make more of a scene.while my guest waited for his proper dinner, and as all good hosts do, both my wife and i waited for our guest's food to arrive . needless to say, while waiting our guest's food, our own food got extremely cold. and when eventually, the waiter came back with my guest's steak, not only did it turn out to be the same steak that was rubbery and undercooked, but this time the steak was completely overcooked and charburned at the bottom. because i was hosting this dinner, i called for the manager to express our concerns. and while he listened deducted the price of the three steaks, his attitude was one of arrogance and indifference. it is as though he has been there far too long to provide good service. in fact, his demeanour expressed that he could care less about delmonicos and the patrons experience. and if both waiter and manager were my employees and i run a court building operation , they both would have been shown the door.in your handout it states that you are attempting to rebuild the delmonico brand once again. and while this is laudable, you may want to make it a priority to instruct and educate both waiters and managers on proper customer service and etiquette. after all, is that not the reason that delmonicos is in business, and the staff is there to provide professional service and give the patrons a good delmonico experience in fact, if you do not address this problem, delmonicos will most certainly lose more patrons.we are from toronto, canada. and when my wife made this reservation, it was meant to be a particularly special celebration because she has cancer . however, our delmonico experience turned out to be a complete disaster. not only was cutlery missing and we had to ask several times not only was service absent and not there not only were we neglected as patrons not only was the food deficient not only were we insulted when presented with the meal check, but more importantly, we were all embarrassed beyond what any words could ever express by your staff.we set at table our check number was the waiter i can only identify as tall, old with an accent and wearing his glasses on his forehead stipe g and the manager ."
524,Saffi S.,1111,1,7/11/13,worst bartender blond one look like russian terrible rude service! skip this place!
525,Kate L.,1111,1,5/11/13,"i knew the moment i glanced into the dining room and saw the frumpy, fat midwestern clientele i would made a mistake. no matter. my suspicions were confirmed upon my first bite of the wedge salad. i do not know how this is possible but they managed to take a foolproof salad and turn into a bitter rubbery garbage heap. the lettuce was tough and bitter, the bacon were so incinerated as to be tasteless, the the tomatoes were watery like a bad taco bell garni, and the blue cheese was was overpoweringly astringent and sharp, so much so that it burned my gum line. the salad was accompanied by some cold parbaked bread rolls and some oversalted butter. the delmonicos streak was truly demonic a huge mass of yellowed fat and membranes. this was priced at dollars. i've never had such a fatty, overpriced cut of meat at a place purporting to be a steakhouse. truly terrible. the side order of mushrooms were rubbery and overwhelmed by a seasoning that tasted like it been lifted from the stoeffers stuffing mix. the local greens with garlic and lemon were drowned in lemon juice, rendering them indelible. my brother's chicken a la keene tasted like a delta airlines entree from the 's. needless to say we skipped dessert. come here if you enjoy a good tourist trap and want to spend + dollars per person for poorquality food in a stuffy, dated environment. the servers were at least attentive. our waiter insisted we doggybag our sides, huffily proclaiming them delicious! "
526,Nathan B.,1111,1,4/14/13,"i ate at the bar, the two bartenders barely knew i existed. it took minutes to get a drink, for my check. they were not that busy they just are not very good at handling a rush. the one big party was getting their check when i sat down. then the one bartender complained about my being upset with her lousy service. never again."
527,Brice P.,1111,1,3/22/13,"do not even think about doing delivery!you will think, hey, i live a few blocks from delmonico's. maybe i will just skip the walk and order in. i will watch some march madness and enjoy great food. you will order your food and say, 'hey! minutes for delivery that is great. your food will arrive an hour after you order. ok, its delmonico's. its worth it. your food will feel lukewarm. hmpf. if you order the sweet and spicy chicken, your bread will be soaked in some sort of mayo or juices. when you try to lift your sandwich, chicken will fall out and leave you holding your soaked piece of bread. look for some bread that is not soaking wet. chew it. it will be like trying to chew a tire.move on the to the chicken. one bite and you will know it is from delm. the rubber chicken factory. no taste. no spicy or sweet. no juices. it will taste like dried chicken. the french fries had more spice and taste going for them."
528,S. R.,1111,1,1/19/13,"what a horrible experience! i arrived minutes late to meet my boss and her friend, and the hostess told me that i was the first person in my party to arrive. i thought it was odd, but i waited for awhile. i asked again in about minutes and was told that my boss's friend had called and she was running late. so, i waited another half hour, then another host finally agreed to seat me. as i was following him through the dining room, my boss jumped up from a table. she had been there the whole time!now, a word about the hostess. she was wearing skintight stretch white jeggings, a top practically cut down to her belly button, and incredibly high hootchiemama heels. to call her outfit inappropriate would be an understatement. of course, the servers were falling over themselves to cluster around her any free moment they got. it would be easier to overlook her error about my party if she had presented herself more respectably and looked like she had something to do besides make the males drool.then, the waiter was another story. i know new yorkers like to cultivate a special brand of rudeness, but he was hostile. he flat out refused to check into a question that my colleague had for the kitchen. then, i think he overheard us discussing his attitude, and he glared at me from across the dining room. then he never came back another server took over.we were not a difficult party. we are four welleducated professionals who were trying to have a nice meal. in a city with so many choices, you would think that this restaurant would try to provide a quality dining experience. just because you have been around for a long time, does not mean that you cannot fail.finally, all i can say about the food was that it was fine. not great, just okay. if the food had been amazing, maybe the service problems could have been overlooked. i will not only never return to this restaurant, but it will become one of my mostrepeated bad restaurant experiences ever.the manager should reconsider his frontofhouse and service staff."
529,L P.,1111,1,12/2/12,"as steak lovers, my wife and i we were very excited when we saw a groupon for delmonico's especially because there were no menu restrictions. however, our experience was horrible. we were treated like secondclass citizens.our three courses arrived one of top of the other even though there was no wait and the restaurant was not full. we were being served at a literally sickening pace. the appetizers were ok. the steak, while cooked perfectly, was no better than you would expect at a casual dining restaurant. the only positives were the au poivre sauce and the sides brussel sprouts and fries . dessert i had the baked alaska was disgusting. we were never even offered a second drink.the kicker a % gratuity added to the bill."
530,AJ W.,1111,1,9/16/12,"went there on a groupon which said i had the run of the menu. but when i ordered the pound steak that cost they told me it was for two. it did not say on the menu it was for two. delmonico's has a racist, discriminatory seating policy. we got there early and the place was empty. since most of the clientele are young white males with their blonde girlfriends and i am an old jewish alter cocker and my wife asian we were seated in an area where the couples were blacks with whites that was near the kitchen. all you could hear was the clang of silverware. of course i asked for another table and we were seated in a small backroom with better chairs but not in the main dining room. when they tried to seat a older white couple there they declined and were told they could get a table for two in the main dining room in minutes. the club has no such seating policy. if anyone else experienced the same thing please contact me via yelp or facebook. i do not believe in suing anyone as i do not believe in the civil judicial system in new york but you might want to consider this."
531,Richard K.,1111,1,8/5/12,"steakhouse.in the city. can be that badd, right food got the gazpacho for the first time, a light cold soup. it was quite refreshing. as an entr ] c e, i decided to go with the classic delmonico steak. it was in between your typical good quality steak and the kind you get at applebee's. so therefore, nothing amazing but definitely beats your tgifriday, outback and applebee's. for dessert, i regretfully chose the cheesecakes. as a fan it cheesecake.it sucked!! texture and flavor were way off.service they had a section in the lower level of their building so my group and i received a table once everyone got there. we ordered our drinks and food expecting some good service like in any other restaurant. got our appetizers right away, so one star for them. good for them. unfortunately their service could not hold up. basically everything went downhill from here, the service mixed up our orders, had to wait for min to get a waiter to fix it, another for them to get it right, waiter only asked half the table if everything was alright, waiter never came around again to check on us so i was not able to get my steak sauce till i finished half of my steak, and finally when asked to get the bill. it took us two ties and minutes till we finally got it because no waiters were around half the we are there. actually i see them behind the curtains in the kitchen eating the same cheesecake they serve to us.just scarfing them down.i could continue to go on about the ambience.but why bother. i would not recommend nor go to this place myself in the future. the star applies only to their steak, like stood out and shined from everything else "
532,Zachary B.,1111,1,7/24/12,"despite our excitement to try out delmonico's steakhouse, we were terribly disappointed in our experience because the service was so appalling.we had courses at delmonico's. our first course came out almost immediately after we ordered. we finished the course and ended up waiting an extraordinary long time for our second course to come out. when we were about finished our main course i noticed our waiter bring out our desert course and set it on an empty table on the restaurant floor, where it stayed until we were done our entrees. our deserts were out in the open, being hovered over by the wait staff and whoever decided to walk by the table. i could not believe it, i've never seen a restaurant do that before. when we got our desserts they were warm and stale.beyond the timing in the courses our waiter had a general disregard for our table the whole meal. he threw our silverware on the table in between courses, instead of placing it down with concern and care about what he was doing. our waiter never came over to ask us how our meal was once our entr ] c e had been dropped. finally, our waiter decided to completely ignore our request on how to divide the check when we handed him credit cards, and instead simply split the bill down the middle.service that awful does not happen often, and i did not expect it from delmonico's."
533,Yolima Z.,1112,5,8/12/18,first time here for brunch! omg the vegetarian tacos!!! delicious! will be back! recommend % plus it includes a frozen margarita excellent price l
534,Kiran S.,1112,4,7/26/18,"pretty good food! we had the grilled pineapple avocado salad, chicken savanna, and chicken burrito bowl. we also got nachos, which were so unique and different play on normal, traditional nachos really good! the salad and the chicken savanna were great, the burrito bowl is a pass for me. good experience, but it is definitely a bit overpriced."
535,Davaish S.,1112,5,7/19/17,great staff and fun place! food is always consistent and drinks are good. prices are reasonable and the guac and cheese dip is good. try the fish tacos and make sure you get a big margarita!
536,Jillian L.,1112,4,6/20/17,"it is been a while since i had some good margs and mexican food. mad dog & beans totally hit the spot!this may be my new summer spot for margaritas! they have a ton of fruity flavors and they give you an option between frozen and on the rocks. the frozen margs are where it is at! the consistency is very smooth and not icy at all. they use fresh fruit purees to make their flavorings. i tried the frozen mango, frozen blood orange, strawberry on the rocks, and blackberry cucumber on the rocks. our server was nice enough to mix the two flavors for us. out of all, the blood orange frozen marg was my favorite.for food, we ordered the following large guacamole the guac was my favorite of the night! i think that i make a good guac, but i think mad dog may make a slightly better one.mexican corn perfectly charred and smothered in mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder. it comes on a stick for easy eating. i'm always a sucker for anything with mayo and cotija.chicken chimichangas my expectations for chicken chimichangas are low. i've had too many overly fried chimichangas stuffed with dry, flavorless shredded chicken. the chicken chimichangas at mad dog are nicely fried and filled with moist, tasty chicken and lots of cheese.churros w chocolate dipping sauce the only way to cap off the night. enough said.overall, mad dog & beans is a great place for mexican food! the food and drinks are on point and the staff is super friendly! looking forward to coming back soon!"
537,Ricky V.,1112,4,7/22/18,"great happy hour spot in fidi. very nice service and the ambience is always very nice. food is normal, nothing to get too excited about but is acceptable. guacamole and nachos are really good though. recommended."
538,Devon R.,1112,4,8/6/18,cute spot. sangria was very tasty. we had a great server that was friendly and attentive. host could have been nicer but maybe she was having an off day. would stop by again when in the area.
539,Aysha S.,1112,4,7/1/17,"ah.mad dog will always have a special place, near and dear to my heart. this is where i came when i got my job offer right after graduating college. their margaritas are delightful happy hour only occurs at the bar downstairs and their guacamole is great. you can choose the spice level and it comes in a really coollooking stone chiseled bowl. now the summer has dawned on us, i will be back on stone street, and i will be back at mad dog.knocking off one star because the wait staff can be inattentive and rude at times. but i've been here a bunch of times and they can be real sweet so it can be a hit or miss.regardless i recommend it!"
540,Brian G.,1112,4,3/24/18,"ok, so the check in offer was great. saves % on a marg. who can say no to that the margs were great to boot. however, their quesadillas were a bit disappointing for my taste. not as much cheese as i was expecting for the size. i need the oily goodness to satisfy my hungover state on an saturday early afternoon!i got a little annoyed with the fact that i got a pretty decent sized splinter in my left thigh when i hopped back onto the high chair. my jeans did rip a bit too . the management reached out to me to make things right and honestly that is all i needed since i know there is too many things to handle in the restaurant biz.i greatly respect management that makes an effort and you guys have killer drinks too so i will definitely be back here just please sand the seats so i do not get one in my buttcheek next time lol."
541,Phyllis N.,1112,4,3/21/18,"they have the best guacamole ever! my friend and i could not have enough of it. we ordered two frozen margaritas, tacos de cerdo and a grilled pineapples avocado salad. the tacos de cerdo came with beans and rice. the salad was okay. it came with a red sauce, which was spicy. it is a nice place to hangout with friends and enjoy latin music. their music choices do not disappoint."
542,Bel H.,1112,5,7/17/18,"mad dog has some good food, but the stars are mostly for the great staff. i have been here over the years and have seen a few changes, but the customer service has always been % satisfactory shoutout to the top floor . i recommend the basics like their chips and guac, quesadillas, and the tacos. as for drinks, definitely make sure to try their cucumber margarita! it is amazing!"
543,Amy R.,1112,5,4/12/18,"great margaritas!!!i have come here many times for happy hour after work, almost every friday. i have sat inside as well as outside on stone street in the summers. their margaritas are tasty and amazing, very strong!! you can also get a different type of tequila shot.the food is great as well, i've had almost all their food from the menu since i come here so often for the last years!! the guacamole at maddog is the best in nyc! the service is great no complaint at all. my favorite waiter is felix ramirez, professional, attentive and know his job, which for me is important! my favorite place and all is really really good! i highly recommend this place!!"
544,Erick S.,1112,5,6/24/17,"one of the best mexican places in the area. . food stars.best margaritas and tacos in the area. the beef tacos come with guacamole and a side of rice and beans that do not disappoint to say the least. . ambience stars.the great selection of spanish music, low lighting, and casual ambience combine to make this establishment a good choice to spend happy hour or weekend hangout. . staff stars.this is the only reason why i think this restaurant does not deserve stars. i'm a regular in this place and never has a host greeted me at the entrance. i've always had to look for the host to seat us, instead of the other way around. more attentive staff would go a long way to make this place a star establishment.overall great ambience and food. you will enjoy visiting this place!"
545,Emily D.,1112,5,4/24/17,"i've been meaning to write a review for mad dog for some time now. i've been here numerous times with my friends and each time has been amazing. their margaritas here are a must! my favorite flavor is the blood orange but i've tried almost all of them by now. i would say if you are coming here with a bunch of people and drinking get one of their margarita towers, it deff pays out in the long run.my go to order here is the chicken enchiladas in their green sauce. also their guac is a must, i love how you can decide how spicy you want it. i've only eaten inside, they have an upstairs and downstairs dining area. i'm excited to come by in the summer so i can sit out on stone street! love this place one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the city and would deff recommend it for anyone looking for a good time and good food drinks."
546,Dominik D.,1112,4,1/13/18,"really crowded if you come on a friday night, which will effect the speed of waiters waitresses. however, my burrito and rice and beans were well prepared and came out in a fair amount of time."
547,Allison P.,1112,5,5/4/18,kelli was great!! me and my sister stopped in for a margarita. try the mango or the raspberry. they were so good we came back later the same day.
548,Melissa D.,1112,5,2/16/18,the food here is really good. as expected it was crowded but our food came out quickly and the drinks were nice and strong!!
549,Courtney M.,1112,5,7/11/18,"great service and food! to be located in the financial district, they have reasonable prices!"
550,Cara B.,1112,5,6/14/16,"hands down might be the best margaritas and chicken enchiladas i've ever had! so impressed with the food here i will definitely be coming back.i also had the guacamole as a starter and it was delicious. for my entree i had the pollo enchiladas which came with rice and beans. the enchiladas were covered in a verde sauce which was to die for. needless to say i cleaned my plate!for drinks, my friends and i first ordered a pitcher of blood orange margaritas on the rocks. i'm not a big margarita lover but these were so good i could not resist. the pitcher is a good size. there were people and we each had at least margaritas each out of the pitcher. we then tried just the classic margarita on the rocks and they were just as good.i cannot wait to go back. it may be a little pricey but it definitely worth it!!!next time i am going to sit outside on stone street. this place is great all around."
551,Christopher S.,1112,3,5/30/17,"while the location is a+ right in the thick of stone street the food was just ok. we started with the guacamole and mexican street corn which were both good, although nothing to write home about. we then went with an order of the cheese and chicken quesadilla's which were somewhat lacking in flavor, with not much too them. perhaps we did not order the right things. the food is priced fairly however, especially since you are in an excellent location.on the plus side, the margarita's were excellent and there were some happy hour deals available. definitely stop by for some after work drinks."
552,Jon W.,1112,4,5/8/16,"great mexican food, margaritas, and servicei went here on a saturday night for dinner and was able to get a table pretty quickly. when you walk in you will notice loud pop music playing and large bar with a bunch of high tables. you feel like you are walking into a fiesta!we were greeted by a nice waitress and ordered the chips and salsa a surprise to me since most mexican restaurants come with chips and salsa. we also split the big margarita and got the mango flavor in it with the chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos. the margarita was made perfectly and the chicken enchiladas were so good with the sweet green sauce on top and the tacos were really good too and good portions.in short great margaritas good food with good portions friendly wait staff"
553,Dao L.,1112,5,6/20/17,"went here for yelp event. the food and service were on point!we were served mild guac and chips. the guac contained more tomatoes than i usually liked mine but the ratio kinda worked. it was delicious. the guac came in a large shallow bowl so it was misleading on the amount of guac. do not dip too much guac per chip lol. . also had, a strawberry, mango, and electric blue frozen margaritas with salt. yes, i am an alcoholic . the margaritas as well prepared as there is good amount of alcohol in them. i got tipsy on my first drink but i am also a light weight asian. next thing we had were grill corn with cheese. and o m g, it was so good. i inhaled the corn in less than a minute. the corns were prepared well, it contained all the moisture and the sweet juice from the corn goes well with the hint of spice they throw on it. highly recommend.later came the chicken chimichangas. it was good but nothing special. lastly, we had the churros with some strawberrys.now, i always get my churros from some random lady in subway station for . so that is what i compared it too. the churros in this place is undersized and a bit too hard in texture compared to the subway churros. the service ."
554,Matthew R.,1112,3,6/17/17,"stopped in for some guac and margaritas. we went with a large guac which was good size and pretty delicious. we also had blood orange margaritas which were pretty good. the restaurant feels pretty corporate, like a more hip chili's. not sure if i would actually come back for more than guac and margaritas but i's not a bad spot to start the night."
555,Sara L.,1112,4,1/5/18,"cool spot. i like the bar and ambiance. the margaritas are really good and strong! food is alright, i just like to get drinks and appetizers. guacamole is the best and the quest function is good too. for dessert the best fried ice cream. good spot for drinks"
556,Courtney T.,1112,5,2/3/18,"have come here for lunch many, many times and have never been disappointed. despite the heavy crowds, the food and service is never impacted. i highly recommend, however, making a reservation as it is often a very long wait during lunch hours. if you are looking for a quiet spot, you may want to pass. but if you are looking for quality mexican food and a fun atmosphere, i suggest stopping in."
557,Anissa C.,1112,5,8/7/16,"i'm obsessed with this place. i'm familiar with the neighborhood, as i went to high school and worked in the area.it is truly a gem. the vibe is always right, and the staff is competent and helpful.the menu is pretty traditional and accurate. the food is phenomenal. my favorite thing to order here are the steak tacos. the tacos come with rice and refried beansit is the perfect meal. i would totally recommend that meal.also, their margaritas are bangin'!!!! you cannot order a frozen margarita everywhere. in my experience, they are usually slushy, watery, and tasteless most places, but theirs are a ! to die for.happy hour mondaythursday, and their brunch, which i have yet to try, is on the weekends! come through."
558,Chris E.,1112,4,7/27/15,"perfectly situated in the heart of the stone street drinking scene. the restaurant is pretty big with floors and outdoor seating. the happy hour, which consists of sangria and mexican beers, lasts until pm so get your drinking in early!since this restaurant is so big, it can easily accomodate large parties, which we happened to have. we had a party of about people and they promptly seated us upstairs. we ordered quite a few entrees of quesadillas and nachos with guacamole. the food went perfectly with the alcohol and although my mental state might have been altered , i thought the food was very good. be prepared to do some shouting though as the place was loud and the service was fast!"
559,Nicole S.,1112,4,11/12/17,"i came here with a group of friends for dinner. we ordered a bunch of food including chips and guac, nachos, quesadillas, and pitcher of margherita to split. everything was very good. prices here are a bit on the higher end for a night out, but still reasonable."
560,Gen W.,1112,4,4/16/17,"i really enjoyed this place. they have great service and are a great place for groups. this place gets packed on the weekends and there are a bunch of fun places to wander to after. they have great guacamole. i was a little bummed about the size of their blended margarita, as it came in a small water glass. at a minimum, i would have expected the margarita in a proper margarita glass. the environment and selection of food was solid!"
561,Ray H.,1112,5,9/17/16,"first look at this place and you can tell it is fun. coming here on a friday evening was a really good choice. besides the amazing drinks and vibe, there were amazing people there. everyone there was all about having fun and making friends.the drinks were really good, and on top of that the bartenders were as well. mingling and having the occasional shot with customers makes the experience that much better."
562,Mia O.,1112,5,3/20/17,"this is my goto spot for margaritas near work essential. great guacamole and other food items. a bit pricey but worth it. service can be a bit slow because this place is usually packed, so just be prepared. i like sitting at the bar, or upstairs for more privacy. really nothing can beat the outdoor seating on stone street which is heated when it is chilly outside. so lovely and fun!"
563,Amanda M.,1112,4,11/6/17,"i always have a fabulous experience here when i sit with amanda, the bartender! she is quick and friendly.a true professional! margaritas are awesome too! food is ok."
564,Ram K.,1112,1,5/18/17,"went here for lunch on a week day. when we went the place was half full.absolutely cold service. no greetings smiles what so ever. a robot could have done a better job.we ordered a mojito, guac, tacos and chicken fajitas.mojito no alcohol. simple syrup and lime juice may be.guac very goodtacos avgthe server was very rude. when picking up plates, they dropped guac on my shirt leaving a huge stain. he did not even care to see that or say sorry. i understand everyone makes mistakes. but see that and say that. the waitress saw that they dropped guac on my shirt and she did not even care to utter a word! absolutely horrible!!so for a lunch check i get mojito without alcohol, avg tacos and a huge stain on my nice shirt.i am always on the side of servers when they some mishap happens. but the fact that they remained silent even after seeing what happened was the absolute worst. i am never going back."
565,Angie M.,1112,1,9/19/17,"i've had my last horrible experience here. i only order from here because i can order guac without onions. the other food i've had is not that great. i find it weird to eat the chicken enchiladas with cubes of chicken instead of shredded chicken. and today, i'm glad i went the whole way back to the restaurant to pick up my guac, because the tortilla soup was awful and i threw it out after two bites. i've never tasted anything so bland and weird. plus both the cheese and the chicken were in cubes. it was just strange.today's experience started off badly because they did not get the order from grubhub. ok. understandable. but then i was asked to reorder. what so i'm to get charged twice because you cannot retrieve an order no! one of the girls was nice and took my phone and put the order in from there. so i got my order, walked back to my office, open the bag, and only half of my order was in there. then i call to let them know, and the guy on the phone decides to give an obviously angry customer a hard time. i mention what happened, and he kept mentioning sending it out to me via delivery well, i kept correcting him to tell him it is pick up. so he says i'm trying to correct it if you would stop talking over me. hey how about listening to your customer from the beginning instead of escalating their irritation!! so then he insists on getting my address, and i asked why he says he is going to have it delivered. i said, yet again, it is for pick up. he assumed that delivery would be an easier option and was getting angry with me because i kept requesting pick up. something is wrong with this guy. this place does not know much about customer service, and especially at a busy lunch hour.i've had other irritating service from here previously, and the food is not worth it. not in the least bit."
566,Omayra P.,1112,2,4/27/17,"i decided to go into this place because they were giving out free don julio shots. the only thing i did not like was that happy hour ended at pm which is too early. so i ordered the chicken flautas and a frozen mango margarita. the flautas were filled with potatoes inside of chicken, i was disappointed because that is false advertisement. i then ordered a frozen coconut margarita and the flavor was not that much different. i feel that the liquor content was barely in the margarita. i did not even get a buzz."
567,Allie O.,1112,5,1/20/18,"liked this place a lot. it was really busy on a friday night but service was so great, friendly and quick! food was delicious . i had the chicken enchiladas and we ordered their guacamole for the table, would definitely go back."
568,Micaela S.,1112,1,11/4/17,"the manager of this restaurant, jaffar hamad, failed to protect me and my friends from a family who verbally assaulted us during our dinner. they threatened to assault my friend in the bathroom where there were no the manager refused to ask them to leave. action was taken after they pulled the hostesses hair and a brawl began. we called the police, fearing for our lives, and the manager did not even care. the manager still expected us to pay for a dinner we were too scared to have eaten. he put our lives in peril and his own staff in peril and felt no remorse for the situation that ensued. i will not be returning, and i urge those reading this to grab drinks elsewhere because you are not safe in this bar."
569,Nikki G.,1112,4,7/7/17,went here for sunday brunch while staying nearby at the recommendation of a bartender we me the day before. we sat out back on the cute stone street area and had a delicious brunch and margarita special. the chips and guacamole were the best. i need to come back next time i visit.my only warning is that service was a bit slow so if you are in a rush maybe rethink going at a busy time but still was really good.
570,Alex S.,1112,4,3/13/17,one of the best mexican spots on stone street. they have excellent margaritas and food. me and my friend shared the queso fundito and i decided to go with the enchiladas for my main. always enjoy this place
571,Shanta B.,1112,4,8/30/17,cute indoor outdoor place especially if you are a fan of mexican food! the jalapeno margarita is a must! especially if you love it extra spicy!
572,Donato G.,1112,3,6/13/18,"we came on a friday evening, and this place was packed. we waited about an hour to be seated. once we were finally seated, the service was excellent. fun atmosphere and a great place to grab drinks. however, the food is mediocre. i would suggest coming here during happy hour or just to grab drinks, but not for an authentic mexican meal."
573,Margaret L.,1112,1,9/22/18,"do not go here! if i could give them a zero star rating, i would! my bf and i wanted to try a new mexican place since we always order from a diff spot and we figured we would try mad dog since we live a block away. we placed an order for delivery over two hours ago, and i called to follow up. they said that the kitchen was busy and backed up, and i should cancel my order. she was not apologetic whatsoever, and they have awful customer service. i was reluctant to try them out due to the poor reviews, but they are all true. do not go here!"
574,Kisa R.,1112,1,8/22/18,"i came here with my coworker for late dinner. i had two red sangria which were ok at best. the rice n beans were bland no seasoning. the chicken wings were okay as well. i had the chimichangas which was okay however, my colleague had steak nachos which she said was less than desirable. she reported instantly getting a tummy ache after the first few bites. the waiter took it back but, were both less than impressed with the food here. not sure i will return to this establishment."
575,J I.,1112,1,8/20/18,"it all started with the rude nasty server who was irritated because the restaurant was crowded. we ordered a margarita tower, she left without letting us pick a flavor for it. we flagged her down and she rushed us to pick one before it was made, even though it was her fault for leaving in the middle of our order.she swiped my card at least three times because my bank cut it off, and locked my account. she brought me back four recipts that said declined as i had my bank app open, looking at my money, in my account. i assume my account was locked after she swiped it so many times. we asked for an atm and she it was two clubs down. we said we would go and she requested we leave something as collateral, so i left my phone. my friend and i went to the atm while my other friend stayed. she was followed around the restaurant and cursed and berated by the server we had. she said we were skipping out on our bill, she called her names, and called us broke. honestly after leaving my brand new phone. i'm not sure why we would leave without paying for something as simple as chips and guacamole and a margarita.my account was still locked thanks to the amazing server who overswiped my card, so my bank only allowed me to withdraw .my other friend ended up covering the bill so the server would stop harassing us, and i just apple paid it to her, since i could not use my card.this was by far the worst experience i have ever had at a mad dog restaurant. ever. horrible disgusting staff."
576,Rachelle O.,1112,1,5/29/18,"the food was way overpriced, dollars for chips and salsa! the food was no better than chipotle but double the price. the rice was bland and the beans tasted like black licorice. not worth the money."
577,Jackie O.,1112,1,4/12/18,"i must say i've gone here over a dozen times in the last two years that i have lived on wall street. i love the food here! i live one street away, and i'm sad to say that i came here on tues. and got awful service. we ordered margaritas, guac, and two burritos and my server was no where to be seen for an hour. this was the second time i received bad service. i've worked in the device industry as a hostess, busser, server, and bartender in privately owned and corporate establishments.today i came in with a party of hoping to get a table sometime soon. at i received a text saying we were on the list for dinner. we were told about a min wait. i called at pm to check on our table, i was told i could have a table for and they could add a chair or we can wait longer. my brother and his fianc ] c came here from virginia so i said i would wait for the table of . it is pm officially hours after we put my phone number down for a table of and still no text.i'm beyond embarrassed that i recommended this place to my family. i'm extremely embarrassed that i thought we would have gotten a table here. it is pm and we are finally eating dinner. i will most certainly never go to this restaurant or recommend it again. we ended up eating at beckett's, which had a wonderful bartender, good food, and no wait!!!"
578,Annie R.,1112,1,3/23/18,"came here, was told it would be hours to wait. we said that was fine, we got a text back in minutes so we walked back to just wait another hour. after an hour we asked how much longer because it had been minutes since we got the text the table was ready and their system said we had already been seated and that is why they had not come to find us so they said that regardless we were going to be seated next. we were fine with that, but then another goes by and we watch others get seated and we do not. we gave up and left. bad customer service."
579,Alicia N.,1112,1,2/1/18,i will not be returning! one of the waiters coughed in his hand then picked up silverware and plates and set one of the tables! gross and disgusting!! sorry you lost a customer
580,Jackie H.,1112,1,1/13/18,"tldr check footage in its entirety and do not forget to check the frames make reference to those that may reveal more of the whole truth and not just those that bolster your onesided argument.christina,yes, i hope we could all view that footage. did it show my hair fall into the dish did you see that did you take the hair and do a dna test unless you do, i do not believe some flimsy circumstantial evidence nor some footage could show the whole truth.also, did the footage show my male friend with short hair pull hair out of his rice and beans he was seated diagonal from me. i was not sitting anywhere near his food nor was i flipping it into his food. please take a look at the camera again on afternoon where both my male friend and i found a hair in our own separate dishes. he pulled it out of his rice and beans he said it was deeply embedded inside and placed his on a plate and i placed mine on a napkin. also, why does it matter if it is found while he is eating or found right before he digs in are you choosing to only take responsibility for hair that falls into food right before it is served on the surface of his plate garnish !! and denying responsibility for hair that may have fallen in while it was cooking washed any stage of the preparation process hence why it was inside the food on , after finding it in his rice and beans, he placed it onto a red or orange side plate. check the video again, but either you or the waitress saw him pick it from the orange or red side plate to show them. if you actually watched the footage or had a good enough camera, you would have witnessed this. i found mine in my eggs of the huevos rancheros and placed mine on a napkin and by the time we called over a server and you later came out, i went looking in my napkin and did not find mine. so, you actually picked up hair his and not mine if you want to argue that. check the footage on to see me pull it out of my eggs in the huevos rancheros so glad you have the footage actually . please find that moment that i see it and put into my napkin. my napkin was to the left of me i remember and his plate was red or orange according to my recollection. also, this is not relevant but you mentioned it, and i understand as the restaurant lighting is not the best, but i never cut my hair or changed the length in the last months. i am also fully asian so my people's hair is actually naturally very, very jet black and i have some highlights but i would not call it brown . until we do a dna test, it is very funny you keep saying it is my long brown hair that we keep finding in dishes over the course of the two visits.to be fair, not all your servers hostesses had long hair that was tied back. i also cannot see inside your kitchen staff and your servers hostesses because sadly i do not have video footage of that it would be creepy if i did and i commend you for looking through your footage for these details, but please do a better job re incident .while you are at it, please check footage re last sunday. i was disgusted and opening my mouth in shock as i was embarrassed in front of my guests and was uncomfortable since this happened to me before. no one in their right mind laughs when finding hair in their food. also, you are right. i do give businesses a chance. it is why i returned time and time again.i eat out multiple times a week with and without my beloved hats on because of the freezing ny weather lately and although i do touch my hair each time, i've never found hair in any of my plates of food for lunch, dinner, happy hour, or any other brunch place in the east village or in fidi. somehow, my hair always likes to fallout of its hatwhen i am here. not saying it is impossible for hair to fall out when a hat is on, but it is less prone to.also, please feel welcome to comment back on my reviews as i take no offense at all. i am not here to arguethis is not my goal. i simply want to communicate and avoiding my comments and choosing not to respond does not make you look better nor me worse. so no one here is embarrassed if that helps you sleep better tonight.regarding the tip, i wanted to pay a tip proportional to the entire meal but you gave us a bill that had one small charge and resembled a bill of someone else's. why, of course, we were confused. i brought it to your attention simply asking for the bill that reflected our meal's entire cost so that i can give a better tip, i was met with a snicker and a face of annoyance. after that, i was done."
581,Erin L.,1112,1,12/30/17,would never return. we are all sitting here still dumbfounded that this place is serving this quality of food. the soup tasted like a minestrone makeover mess. the quesadillas were weak. the enchiladas were so weak. the beans were awful. the guac was and so so bland. and they messed up my blended margarita. it tasted like a chemical problem.four us came in mega hungry and excited and left still hungry because we could not finish the trash that was in front of us.not worth the cost and not worth the doors being open to this place.again. never coming back. guys. beware!
582,Lorena G.,1112,1,11/5/17,i just watched a manager tell a customer say i do not care if you die at my restaurant. that is not my problem. also then some family got rowdy and a member of it attacked the hodges's. dinner and a show! star for good guac though
583,Carina P.,1112,1,10/29/17,"i love margaritas and was very excited to come here. we could not sit at a table inside because the hostess was adamant you had to have a reservation or go through the hostess even though some tables were empty.the margarita was and i was craving a margarita. i was served the most disgusting margarita i've had in awhile. if you get anna, the tall blonde bartender, run in the opposite direction. she was very rude. when i asked for her to remake my drink she gave me attitude and said, i cannot help you hun . extremely condescending. i had to ultimately ask the manager for the margarita to be remade.the manager brought the drink back to anna and she made it just as bad probably just to be spiteful. horrible place. there are other bars on stone street worth your money and time, this one is not."
584,T. H.,1112,1,10/21/17,"terrible service and mediocre food. this place is in such a great street, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!!!"
585,Marie S.,1112,1,10/6/17,"food and margaritas here are decent, but stay away if you value your time or your credit card security. have literally never had a good experience here. last few times i've been took a client here for lunch and she was a little late getting off the subway so we arrived literally min after our reservation time, evidently you lose your lunch reso after min ok, way too strict but fine , we got bumped to the back of the line including walkins not fine and had to wait min so had only min for lunch awkward made a lunch reso for our group, even called same day to confirm it, yet when we arrived they said they had no record of it in their system ! . waited min for a table, were comped a pitcher of margaritas but really just give us a table went for drinks after work and they gave me the wrong credit card when i closed my tab, i did not realize until i got home, called to ask if they still had my card and they asked me to come in tomorrow and check because the bar is really busy right now, and also a lot of people are calling to get their credit cards uhm, what . i called again, explained if they no longer had my card and had given it to someone else i needed to know as soon as possible so i could cancel it. was told they could try to check later in the evening. they finally checked and called me back, they no longer had my card but had no idea where it had gone no charges had appeared on it so looks like they did not use it for someone else's bill. so, where is it ! and also, they did not seem to care that i had another customer's card! beyond absurd. never going back."
586,Mary H.,1112,1,8/29/17,we had a great dinner upstairs with orlaeigh. then continued downstairs at the bar are you kidding me charging a service charge of percent hanging at the bar we are not cheap tourists my husband gave bucks anyway on top of your ridiculous charge.we will never go back there tourists check your bill
587,Meredith M.,1112,1,2/22/17,"yes, it is national margarita day. yes, it is expected we would experience a wait at any mexican joint in the city. but we were quoted a thirty minute wait and did not get a table until two hours after arriving. the restaurant tried to make up for this with a round of free margs, but unfortunately with barely any standing room this really did not help. upon seating, we were told there was a . hour limit on our table. ok, but we waited for longer than that. one star for not being prepared for what you know would be a busy night and not setting proper expectations we easily could have and would have gone somewhere else had we known how long the wait would be."
588,Erin L.,1112,1,2/17/17,"i wanted to give zero stars but the one star will go to the bartender. we waited for a table like normal, we got sat, and had a group of maybe . we had ordered drinks from the bar before we got sat. waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything we literally just got sat so i said we needed a minute. a bar back or someone came over just before that too and we said the same thing. so we waited. and we waited. probably minutes. never got to order the food. waitress slapped the checkbook on the table for my friends bucket of beers. never even asked us if we wanted food, which we were ready to order. had a talk w manager, he did not seem to care and defended her the whole time saying we sat there for two hours which was a complete lie. offered us food but did not want to eat their crap. bye"
589,Jay K.,1112,1,12/25/16,"originally left a great review. then had horrible experiences. first, i ordered delivery. i live right around the corner. minutes after i ordered, a girl calls me to tell me they are out of chili. would have been nice to be told this sooner, but fine, no problem. i swap it for something else. they totally forget to bring it with my delivery. they also forget to bring the sides of guac sour cream etc that i asked for. when i call back to express my frustration, the girl tells me that it is not her fault quite rudely. she clearly has never worked a day in hospitality. very turned off. i think her name was shanastupidly, decided to give it one more shot on a friday night. what a mistake. place was clearly incapable of being a quality restaurant at this hour as they were more in bar mode . service was terrible. order was brought out incorrectly. some of the food was cold. terrible experiencesad, because they do cook up quality mexican food. unfortunately their staff has not been trained in hospitality and their overall management service is inconsistent."
590,Terry D.,1112,1,10/30/16,"overpriced. there were of us. three ordered entrees one of which was a burrito . one did not eat. one had an appetizer. we had about drinks for the table. the total came to . i put in for two dos equis lager, a coconut shrimp appetizer and a shot of cheap tequila. the food is unremarkable mexican fare. average at best. left feeling as though we would been had. everyone was disappointed. not going back."
591,Nikaus 2.,1112,1,8/29/16,i visited this place for friday dinner with my friends. very rude staff specially the manager. the waiter brought a hot sizzling plate and dropped it on my friends legs n she got a burn rash. the waiter did not have a curtesy to say sorry. on complaining this to manager he said there was no burns and asked us to pay the bill and leave. he was so rude to all of us. we had to call the cops and they got my friend examined and there was a burn mark which was painful. never ever visiting this place again.first thing i did not say entire plate jus a sizzling drop is enough to burn a skin proved by the cops and doc. second think the manager offered for cream and ambulance when we called the cops. and we did not hear a sorry or apology from the manager or waiter. third thing the manager could offer more help but just said pay the money and leave and that is wen we said this is unfair n inhuman . and last thing the two hour wait after burn is because she was trying to ease her skin by sprinkling water and rubbing ice over it. and wen even after two hours there was no apology but only inhuman treatment given to us jus cos the manager wanted the money from us and suppress the matter.please provide ur staff with some training and honesty.
592,Camila B.,1112,1,8/1/16,its a beautiful place with terrible food. im sure that the stake in my quesadilla was made the night before. unless you like to chew on old gum you will not enjoy this.my vegetarian friend got a veggie enchilada that smelled like it fell into the fire. i did not even have to try it to taste the smokyness in it. even the tomatoes in the pico de gallo tasted old. i would not like to look in the kitchen fridge. i guess the decor was fun but there was nothing mexican about this place besides that.ps i have been to mexico. trust me the mexican food trucks are way better than this place.
593,Princy A.,1112,1,5/8/16,"no.we called ahead of time to see if reservations were necessary. when we got a hold of someone they said they do not take reservations for this hour. when we arrived, the owner asked do you have a reservation uhm.excuse me !aside from that, this place is still a big fat 'no' in my book.wayy too loud.wayy too many people. this is where millennials come to be seen and take selfies. not where interesting people come to have good conversations."
594,Vanessa H.,1112,1,4/18/16,clearly they did not want to take anymore orders because i came an hour before close but ppl were still in there and the bartender refused me service.
595,Carlos G.,1112,1,3/18/16,"went in around on friday, hostess did not want to put our name on the wait list because other hostess does this duty . she did not know how long the wait was. we walked over to restaurant next door, adrienee's, and was seated right away."
596,John B.,1112,1,12/14/15,"came in for dinner around pm on saturday evening. was seated fairly quick, even with a full house downstairs and a private party upstairs. ordered wasters and three cokes. they actually serve pepsi, so i asked the waitress not to give me one since i prefer coke i do not know why they cannot tell the customer that they are serving pepsi vs coke we ordered our food, and did not see the waitress again while our water glasses sat empty. food for of us came with an apology that the enchiladas for the th in the party would be coming shortly. the of us finished and no waitress and no food. we had to get the hostess to ask the waitress where our food was. waitress still never came back catherine . hostess came back and said it was coming. finally manager came, asked if there was any issues and we told him about the absentee waitress and no food. he said he was going to comp the enchiladas. food came but everyone was finished and she was not in mood to eat. waitress still never came and we had to get the manager to get our check. he gave us the check, with pepsi vs . he brought back check, we paid and left. the food that did come was average at best.i swear the black beans came out of a can. the cheese that was suppose to be on the side came with the enchiladas, we said why would we wnt that now when we were finished very unorganized. there are better places for mexican food.the general manager did send two emails offering comp food and drink, however i opted not to take up their offer.i went back on monday for lunch with a coworker who did not know of my experience there on saturday. i did not tell him of it either. he picked the place for lunch.service was better, food just ok.maybe two and half for that visit"
597,Ken S.,1112,1,9/4/15,"horrible service, no one knew what was going on. the food was also bad. no flavor."
598,Leila G.,1112,1,8/29/15,worst bartenders on stone street. they are not attentive and do not know how to use a remote control. both my friend and i got sick from their food on separate occasions.
599,Tanner S.,1112,1,8/13/15,terrible atmosphere not at all kid friendly terrible food terrible service i would never recommend this place washrooms also filled with pee everywhere on the floor it is also very busy and messy while trying to find the washroom i got beer on my shirt and i had not even been drinking it was because someone had thrown some at me also i could not hear the person beside me even when they were trying to talk in my ear they actually had to yell over the yelling and music
600,Hornamkis P.,1112,1,6/18/15,"the food was bad.the food was dry and old.we complained for the food and nobody came to apologize.tips were already included, % even though was not good.i do not recommend to anybody.worst mexican food in manhattan."
601,Jay L.,1112,1,4/15/15,"i do not normally write yelp reviews, but i feel its my duty to let my fellow patrons know that i had food poisoning from this place. i ordered the steak tacos for lunch on monday and was out of commission for a good hours. again, i'm not one to bad mouth a restaurant if it is not needed, but i've been miserable for the past day and a half thanks to this place."
602,Katie P.,1112,1,3/22/15,"my teenaged daughter and i ate lunch at the pearl street venue on thursday march th, . we had visited the statue of liberty and ellis island and we were looking for a reasonable place that could accommodate my glutenfree diet. as the place was full, we thought it might be good. the guacamole and chips were good but our entrees were bland. my daughter had the pulled pork tacos and i had the chicken enchiladas. we thought, ok, we will not be eating here again. then a few hours later after having arrived at our midtown hotel my daughter became violently ill. since the only thing that i did not eat that she ate were the pulled pork tacos, we suspect that the dish made her sick. she spent hours vomiting. luckily she recovered and the next day we continued with our tour of the city. if i had more time in the city, i would have reported them to the city health department, but as tourists we were leaving for toronto on saturday. under no circumstances eat here. you risk your life."
603,Salima K.,1112,1,3/3/15,"i got there on a friday with two others, and the service is terrible. not only did they lie and say it would be a min wait, they kept telling people that who came in the door. i waited for an hour and a half and the hostess had to nerve to ask if i would share the next available table with another party of three! who in their right mind thought that was a good idea i ended up leaving because that was just ridiculous."
604,Jessica R.,1112,1,1/23/15,"normally i like going to mad dogs the food is average, but the guacamole and the margaritas are generally very delicious. however after several incidents with the hostesses i have to provide a very low review for this place. there have been several occasions where i have come in at the end of the lunch hour when there are open tables available slightly larger than our party and i have been quoted that they have no seating and our wait is minutes. there was not an attempt for creativity, or a realization that that the lunch hour is over and there will be no other onslaught of customers so they could sit us at a larger table. instead there was only a very cold response and a completely indifferent attitude towards us. on one occasion a supervisor intervened and was able to sit us, of course the supervisor went upstairs and realized that two smaller tables could be pushed together something that hostess was unable to figure out. i can not express how disappointed i was today with hostesses, i do not think i will be coming back."
605,Melissa A.,1112,1,9/19/14,"so it is unfortunate that we are still sitting here and ordered nearly minutes ago and are still waiting for our food.we just asked for our check and since they changed our waitress she has not even realized we did not get our entrees. we waited minutes for our first round of beer and the people that came over a half hour later got their food before us.very disappointing when you are on a time schedule and think an hour and a half to eat would suffice but it did not due to extreme oversights on their part.so another minutes have passed and i was waiting for the outcome after voicing our disdain to our new waitress, she was very apologetic and spoke to the manager.we are glad to know that our time wasted was barely worth more than a beer."
606,M D.,1112,1,8/29/14,"the staff is unintelligible and extremely rude.love their guacamole extra spicy so purchased it along with a side of sour cream.they forgot my side of sour cream understandable, when i went back the manager had the worst attitude saying well what should i do about it i told her to give me a refund or give me the item i purchased.i mean it is just sour cream it should not've been that big of a deal.so the manager laughs and has this sort of condescending attitude towards me and my friends.food is a .customer service is null."
607,Zach S.,1112,1,8/22/14,"this was a misrepresentation of information. i called ahead of time and asked about happy hour. the girl that answered said yes, it goes from . she never said where it happens. so, we got charged full price. do not sit outside for happy hour. you will get robbed. happy hour only happens at the bar.i will not be back anytime soon."
608,Bill R.,1113,5,10/12/18,"a must for tourist. get in line, get your ticket, get your pastrami sandwich and enjoy. the place is percent tourist trap but it super fun and tasty food. the sandwich is tasty and the pickles are divine. do not loose that ticket, or it costs to get out the door with out it!"
609,Sinan Z.,1113,5,8/25/18,this place really meets the hype!!the hot pastrami on rye is soooo great! i also got the matzo ball soup and i enjoyed it as well! the line looked really long but it moves fast. this is a musttry!!
610,Samantha L.,1113,3,10/15/18,"pastrami is good but i do not think it is worth it for the price and the amount of tourists bustling inside.i came here on a monday for lunch in september and it was packed inside. it is not tourist season it was a monday. i wonder how busy it gets on the weekends during the summer!!!after semi pushing through the crowd i was finally able to stand in line and order. i ordered the pastrami sandwich and the butcher gave us samples of the pastrami. the pastrami was so hot and delicious.however, each sandwich is ~ . granted, you can probably share the sandwich with one other person but it is not a huge sandwich.after you order, find a seat, and sit down with your food, the pastrami cools down a bit and it is not as good as when it is hot. because of this, i thought the sandwich was just alright. definitely not worth . bread breaks apart super easily as well. if you come here, make sure to be in good company because the food are not worth. in my opinion, the hype of this place is not real.although the pastrami is good, the chaotic jumble of this place makes it not worth it. this place is more like a try once for the experience type of place."
611,Adele P.,1113,3,10/15/18,"ancient tourist trap. there is better out there. we come here with out of town guests who want to see the place, but honestly, you can get this stuff at smaller delis with a better selection.cash only, long lines, has not been updated since my grandmother went there as a kid. the pastrami is good, the attitude is annoying. if i'm going to go to a cashonly establishment with nyc clout, i'm going to go to eisenberg's."
612,Allison F.,1113,5,10/9/18,katz's is the most delicious nyc institution worth the hype. come early before it gets too crazy packed full of folks. i only had a short wait on a late morning morning.
613,B C.,1113,4,11/2/18,the hot pastrami is to die for. everything else is a combo of nostalgic good and tourists bad .enjoy!
614,Jeannette M.,1113,3,11/5/18,"ordered the meat combo, nothing special other then the hype of tourist visit and of course i'm one of them. order the ruben at least the sauerkraut can help the dryness of the meat. drench my meat with mustard to help the meat moisture . also do not loose your ticket if you loose it even if you want to go in for a visit."
615,Eleri W.,1113,5,11/6/18,"hands down the best sandwich i have ever had. you never really want to hand it to the overly popular places, but i got to say, they really have their deli down. our guy gave us tastes of different meats that were all absolutely mouthwatering. he was sooo friendly too! once we got our sammies, we could not wait to dig in they were works of art! they may be known for the infamous i will have what she is having moment but i will honestly have whatever whoever is having because i guarantee it will be fresh, flavorful, and stacked!"
616,Sarah P.,1113,4,8/8/18,"oh, the famous katz. there is so much to love about you.this staple in the les is a must eat if you are a meat lover.i've had that reuben +pastrami and the macaroni salad. guys, the meat is tender, juicy and piled high, but what was such a surprise to me was the macaroni salad. i am constantly craving it now.if the food was not amazing in itself, the theatrics of the whole thing make it a cool place to stop in.when you walk in you get a ticket for all your ordering needs. the place is jam packed with people mostly tourists . you choose which meat cutter you wish to order from. take in the giant restaurant filled to the brim with pictures and memorabilia. watch the cuter slice your meat, taste a bite and get ready for the pile of meat you just ordered.it is truly unique and gives you a taste of old new york.the only thing to gripe about is the price tag. get ready to she will out at least for one sandwich, but at the end of the day, it is worth it."
617,Melissa L.,1113,5,11/2/18,"okay, so it is crowded and you will likely end up sharing a table with someone kind enough to consolidate seatsbut the meat. oh, the juicy meat! add homemade pickles and traditional deli vibe and you have a destination eat for the bucket list. the line moves fast, folks. cash only. you will not regret it."
618,Biana G.,1113,5,10/13/18,"while most people go the conventional pastrami on rye approach, i encourage you to give the hotdog and noodle soup a try on your next go around. katz is a city staple and highly highly recommended!! prices are on the high end and there may be a wait, but it moves quickly."
619,Leslie W.,1113,5,8/20/18,"i had my first ever reuben here and i'm sure it will be the best reuben too. the juice, the flavor, the texture of the pastrami set a really high bar for all the pastrami yet to come in my life.the intrigue of katz's also lies in the physical environment. the decor, the crowdedness, the hard journey to the table while trying to secure your plate in a sea of people, the faces, the ticket system lifted the whole katz's experience to another level. it made so much sense to me why katz's is so popular. i loved it!"
620,Debi R.,1113,3,7/27/18,"i wanted to love this place. we were a party of and we all ordered something different.of course we ordered the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. we also had cheese steak sandwiches, chicken sandwiches and more. most of the meat was on the dry side. our overall rating of the food was average.the way you order is a bit confusing. upon entry you get a ticket. when you order your food, you give the server your ticket and they write the price it and return it to you. the same goes for ordering sides and drinks. you pay as you exit. if you lose your ticket, you pay .which would have been perfect if we lost ours, cuz after sandwiches, sides and many beers they would have lost money!staff was friendly and helpful when asked how to navigate the ordering system.the only time i said, i will have what she is having. is when i was asked if i wanted another beer."
621,Raymond L.,1113,5,7/16/18,"i came here at am on a weekday and they were still getting ready with all the bread and supplies going through the back, and then going to the front of the line where everyone is waiting to assist.you get a ticket when you enter and i've been told not to lose it. so i suggest you would not lose it either haha. i got in line and immediately knew what i was going to get. pastrami sandwich on rye, with mustard. it also comes with pickles and cucumbers as well. i got it to go but you very well could eat it here there are plenty of tables here. oh yeah, they also give you a small plate, a sample kinda, of the pastrami to see if it is to your liking.for paying, if you are paying by credit card, you would have to go way in the back because that is the one place that they have to pay by cc. cash is up front. here is where keeping that blue ticket pays off and gets you out of here.the pastrami is good. it is not too too too salty and has a lot of flavor you will have to taste it to experience it haha. it is made perfectly and was a welcome addition to my stomach at in the morning haha. there is layers on layers on layers and just so much meat in there that you will understand why it is over haha.probably would come back if i were in the area, maybe try something else haha"
622,Stephanie G.,1113,4,7/17/18,"it is popular, crowded, loud, and kind of uncomfortable, but it is a must try.i went on a saturday afternoon to try to hit off hours. for the record, i've tried to eat here before but saturday night the wait was insane. it is a little confusing inside. they hand you a ticket that you have to give back on your way out there is a sign threatening a fine if you lose it but i cannot tell if it is a joke or not . you can either order at counter and find a place to sit or you can get waiter service and you cannot sit in the wrong place or they will quickly ask you to move. we were told our person party would be a half hour wait but we were seated in less than .there is a few things on the menu, but the pastrami is a must have. they make it in house and it is like no other meat you have ever had. i got it on rye bread and a sign threatened about asking for mayo again not sure if this was a joke but the meat comes out so hot and juicy and salty and succulent you do not really need any condiments and i love condiments .they also give a complementary bowl of pickles, which is probably great if you like pickles. i also got a side of fries since it seemed like a good idea with the sandwich a the fries were amazing too b the sandwich is enormous so only consider if you are sharing.i only ate half the sandwich, so big and delightful as it was, then i felt kind of queasy later it is a lot of meat on a sandwich then the next day i had my other half sandwich cold, and it was still pretty good. it is no fresh hot sandwich, but still close.some cons we got in line to exit pay, waited until we were in the front to tell us it is cash only there and you can use a credit card in the back. hey that would have been nice to know before waiting in line. there was very little seating if you ordered at counter, so consider that if you are trying to skip the waiter. it is also like a sandwich which the highest priced nonlobster roll sandwiches i've ever eaten. but if you can come on an off hour or take it to go somewhere where it will still be hot, oh man. it is a must try."
623,Shannon H.,1113,3,9/22/18," been there done that type of place! very crowded, disorganization to the max, waiter service was not great, high prices, some of the food was spectacular! basically a tourist trap.i have been hearing about katz's since what feels like centuries ago.but i was disappointed in the pure chaotic disorganization that ensued during my visit. walking in and it being my first time i had no idea what i was doing. they just hand you a ticket with no explanation on what comes next. well i'm here to explain it to you you are handed a ticket, keep it.it is basically your receiptat the end of the meal your server will fill it out. next you can either pick between self service or waiter service. if you choose self you walk right up to the window of your liking and order your food. after you can sit in the designated areas and enjoy it. if you choose waiter service you will need to give your name to the host. after your name has been called you will be seated on the left wall at one of the tables. if your in a small party they will shove you with another small group. at the end of your meal you can pay at the front.i wish someone would have explained it all to us but everything overall was way too chaotic for my liking.now for the service. our waiter was very abrasive and was not friendly. i was not impressed with the service whatsoever. the food came in around min i'm assuming because of the crowd.the prices are high and honestly i would pay for the pastrami again because i felt that it was worth it. i loved how juicy & tender it was and the rye bread complimented the meat perfectly. as for the corned beef.absolutely disgusting!! it was super dry and had a nasty after taste. the chopped liver w onion best chopped liver i've ever had hands down!!overall i most likely will not visit again. been there done that! the service was not great and it was too crowded and unorganized."
624,Shane E.,1113,5,7/21/18,"you take an institution like this and think, it is a tourist trap. how good could it be but then you finally bite the bullet because you have seen and heard about it for years and now it is saturday with some time to kill. this line is moving pretty quickly, you say to yourself as you check your watch. pm. they wrangle you into a corner if you are waiting for a table , but then they say, feel free to grab a beer at the bar. duh. the cold yeungling is a glass full of beer smiles being poured over your brain.not minutes later, we are being sat right next to the table from when harry met sally . we take in our surroundings, checking out all the notable people immortalized on the katz wall.we have already decided on reuben, add pastramimac saladlatkes + sour cream & apple sauceyou have already lowered the expectation that if it is not great, you will not be surprised. but it is. and it is delicious. and that is how you stay in business for as long as you have been.our pastrami was so moist, just a well constructed sandwich with all the perfect condiments. mac salad was bright and creamy, not too sweet. latkes. c'mon, how can you go wrong with fried potato cakes.we finished up a little past three and the line out the door was no longer.tl dr worth the wait, try and come off hours, pastrami and latkes all day"
625,Iona N.,1113,3,11/2/18,"i do not know why this place is very popular. is list one of the top have try out when you in new york. i order their pastrami sandwich. they meat is good, but i want in the french bread instead of bread slide. i did not know their extras , other wise i order come with it already. the sandwich very simple, just meat and bread. very boring. i used to have my sandwich with vegetable, and sauce or mayonnaise in my sandwich. this style, is definitely is not my style of sandwich. they give you cucumbers and pickles on the side but i preferred my sandwich with cheese and vegetables instead. their sandwich is pretty pricy, for a portion of one person. i ask had their bottle tea. kat lemon ice tea, which is pretty good. that bottle cost about . . at least now i can said that i come here. also, they will give you a ticket, if you lost your ticket you will paid at least minimum plus what ever food you ate. that insane, i saw the guy lost his ticket and he worry so bad, i did not know what going on, i was curious. when i left she told me plus the food. also, there two kind of service, you can sit at the table that actually has someone to serve, or you can order by the stand and ask for sample. come here again, probably not, because new york has to many good restaurant and i want to try them all."
626,Nancy C.,1113,3,10/3/18,"their service, ordering process, and prices suck but i've been a few times because the pastrami is sooo flavorful and juicy. i hate the rule that if you lose your ticket you have to pay . wtf i would literally scream.and the lines are an absolute mess. the staff is not very helpful and some have unfounded attitudes. almost got charged for two sandwiches instead of one but luckily caught their mistake.love your meat but hate you"
627,Michelle J.,1113,5,10/11/18,"i love the vibe of this place! truly iconic and old school. grab a ticket as soon as you walk in and head over to the counters where you can order. i got the pastrami sandwich on rye bread with mustard on it. while i was waiting for my sandwich to be made, the guy gave me a few pieces to try. the meat was really soft and juicy. not dry at all. after you get your order, hand the ticket to the guy, he will give it back to you and you will have to bring it to the next counter to pay. they do accept card and apple pay! i also love the pickles and cucumbers that came with it. it is a shame that i've lived in nyc all my life and i've never once visited this place. i will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches."
628,Tiffany J.,1113,5,8/23/18,"worth.please come here.with over reviews and all the fame it needs, there is not much for me to say. the only beef i've had that topped this was texas brisket. enjoy the heap of pastrami between two pieces of rye and nothing else other than cucumbers and pickles . i love the conceptthe entire show is on the pastrami.otherwise, portions are huge, so be mindful. ordering can be confusing, and lines can get long, so ask before you waste too much time.the matzo ball soup is also pretty good. reminds me of the chinese meatballs from my childhood, but much softer. i also got to try chopped liver and kugel for the first time, which was. interesting. but i am certainly not qualified to say much about kugel or chopped liver."
629,K. Supreme C.,1113,5,10/24/18,"my favorite deli hands down. my pops has been taking me here for decades!!! the pastrami fries with a cherry coke is a must! the best pastrami you will ever have.prices are up there, but well worth it. no complaints. always crowded. sometimes the line is out the door."
630,Michael G.,1113,4,11/8/18,"weeeee! this place was amazing. the food is to die for, seriously. i had a reuben sandwich that was huge, but i ate every bite! pickles. yum. my husband had outstanding matzo ball soup.and fries i know. . it is crowded and loud. i would suggest going at an off time as the regular meal hours have very long lines. having said that, however, the staff is a delight. i mean it. everyone was fantastic, and you could tell they were treated well. plus, who can resist the classic new yorker people will tell you that it is touristy. to that, i say, eh. these are new york prices after all, and some people find that not acceptable.boo hoo! go and have a great time. there are very few tables that have waiter service, and you have to ask for them. otherwise, walk in and step up to the counter. know what you want and eat all you get. it is fantastic."
631,Sean W.,1113,4,6/9/18,"katz's is a classic deli that is known to attract lots of tourists and locals. it is also open late to boot. they are known for selling substantial sandwiches, but they also sell other deli staples. they have a very odd ticketing system, make sure you do not lose it! the venue is fairly large, one orders at the counter with their ticket. service is pretty quick.ordered pastrami sandwich very large portion, but also pretty basic. a very solid pastrami sandwich to be honest. not the best i've had that would be the refuge in san carlos, ca , but definitely something i would get again. i think the bread could have been a bit thicker and toasted. the mustard could also be stronger."
632,Melissa H.,1113,3,10/27/18,"okay. so this place is famous, historic and very crowded. but the lines move fast, so there is that. it is a bit confusing for a newcomer. if you are ordering at the counter, you have to know right away if you are going to get in line for the cutters sandwiches or down further for other hot dishes or drinks. know what you want before you get there! and ask someone to help you find it. we ended up just having a lox everything bagel and it was very good. sat next to the when harry met sally table go here at least once for the crazy experience!"
633,Jason C.,1113,3,5/29/18,"pretty good sandwiches, distinguished by its humongous portion. and the environment is very friendly even though its joined by people from all over the world.to me the price is a bit much for this sandwich, and it does not look very hygienic on the other side of the counter. the unwanted parts of meat were just dumped on the floor, knowing how dirty and infested nyc is, this could be very very disgusting even if they clean it every day."
634,John M.,1113,3,10/25/18,"when harry met yada yada yada . . . crazy big portions. a little over kill if you ask me. if you go with a friend order one sandwich and share.not really a huge fan of pastrami, but it is a good sandwich. once or twice every years.give it a try."
635,Oisin W.,1113,5,11/6/18,the best pastrami sandwhich you will have in your life! reasonably priced in an iconic setting i believe a trip to katz deli should be on the itenirary of every person visiting new york
636,Ella S.,1113,4,10/31/18,"just order the pastrami sandwich. and get it to share. it is gigantic. and delicious.ignore the herds of tourists sorry tourists, we love you, but you do move like a herd . skip the weekends.that is it."
637,Na S.,1113,5,9/6/18,"i know it is pricey, but it is the juiciest pastrami around. if you are wondering about which kind of meat to get, i highly recommend the pastrami. my friend did not believe me and ordered a combination platter of brisket, pastrami, and corned beef. guess what happened we inhaled the pastrami. ended up packing the rest to go.you could order at the counter and ask for samples before you commit. it is usually very busy though so it is not exactly a relaxing place to ponder the big decision. if you do not feel like scouting for your own table, you have the option of getting table service. the only thing is you do not get to try samples but a great option if you want to sit, now.if you are feeling adventurous, the liver is very good as well. get it from the coldcut counter by weight will save you a few bucks."
638,Lincy H.,1113,5,5/14/18,"holy smokes! katz's is an absolute must when in new york. my week long trip was basically a foodie adventure and this was definitely one of my favorite meals.my friends and i came right at lunch time, but were surprised to see only a few people in line. this is because they have the most efficient process ever! there are about different cutters to take your order and prep your food, and then you pay after you finish eating your meal as you are heading out. do not lose your ticket! there are also tons of seating.my boyfriend and i split one pastrami sandwich because we indulged in meals on our last full day in ny . the pastrami is freaking amazing. so tender and flavorful and just beautiful. the fatty slices melt in your mouth. their pickles and cucumber add the perfect crunch too. glad i got to squeeze in some veggies into my system p my only gripe is that their bread was just whatever. toasted dutch crunch or perhaps sourdough would make it the perfect sandwich. but still stars because their pastrami is just that good. i can die happy now."
639,Gregg Y.,1113,5,8/28/18,pastrami. gold standard.katz's is the real deal.do not lose that ticket.
640,alexis f.,1113,5,11/7/18,love this place! been going my whole life! you cannot go wrong with a hot dog & matzoh ball soup!
641,Shanel T.,1113,5,8/22/18,"i've been coming to katz since i was a kid, and i know whenever i need a good sandwich & i mean good! katz is the place to go! everything is kosher, and everything is fresh. upon walking in you get your ticket to order your food, stand in line waiting to be called next. but, in doing so you have to check out the huge mural wall of pictures with any, and every celebrity you can think of since the place has been open. when you order your food, you get to taste some of the samples, whether it is pastrami, corn beef, etc. these are my top faves & let us not forget their distinct pickles!!! loveeee their pickles! after done ordering, if you can find a seat you will have one of the best lunch dinner sandwiches of your life. you pay after you finish eating also! i love katz, and it never disappoints me at all."
642,Meems N.,1113,5,11/5/18,i only leave ratings for restaurants that i would definitely come back to. you can read the gazillion other reviews already on yelp.

644,Stephen S.,1113,5,11/6/18,ok. the sandwiches are huge. and eye popping expensive. and fantastic flavor. honest new york deli. not used to nyc prices will be aghast at the prices. but the food is good and plentiful.
645,Lotus H.,1113,2,8/24/18,"last time i was in here the place was empty. but the system they had attempts to move large crowds thru numbered cutter lines. wait was mins at in the afternoon. pricy sandwiches, rude staff, customer service was nonexistent. built on hype dirty and soso food. i'm sticking to the smaller delis with better prices, atmosphere, food and service."
646,Rebecca A.,1113,5,9/2/18,"well i know it is been said a thousand times but this food is amazing. the ordering system is a little confusing and do not lose your ticket, but you get a ticket and then approach a line, pick any # they move pretty quickly.we split the reuben with a side of fries and a coke and it was my favorite meal of my entire new york trip which is saying something . they gave us two different brined pickles, i liked the two varieties. the meat on the reuben is savory, meaty and scrumptious. you will find yourself hankering for it days and even weeks later.bonus if you are into chick flicks they filmed the infamous i will have what she is having scene from when harry met sally at the restaurant they have a sign if you forget ."

648,Brian C.,1114,4,4/11/17,"before i ever made it to the city, i had heard quite a bit about this place from my friends who had lived here. they really talked it up and made it sound like the bees knees, so needless to say there were quite some expections riding on this place for me. spoiler, this place lives up to the hype quite easily!i will get my lone grievence of this place out of the way early on, and that is the price point. is a bit much to spend on one meal, but no one can question the quality, variety, or richness of flavor you will get from this meal! i regret not getting the lobster roll, and settled for the shrimp roll. while you do not get large pieces of shrimp per se, you still get numerous pieces, and the taste is complimented by a toasted butter roll, with a savory sauce as well. i did get a taste of the lobster with the bisque, and that was amazing and a meal in itself definitely get the combo with the sandwhich .overall, if you are in the city you should eat here without any hesitation. the price is a little high, but the quality and experience are just as high as well. to me, this was a classic new york lunch, and the only way it could have been better was if i were eating outside in battery park on a cool spring afternoon."
649,Yifan D.,1114,2,9/1/18,"preordered the luke's favorite online and picked up in store, and very disappointed. . they forgot to give me chips. . the lobster roll was extremely salty.conclusion too salty, too expensive i got the double sized lobster roll in boston at about the same price , and the server is careless."

651,Isabelle L.,1114,5,9/4/17,best lobster roll ever!!!the crab roll and the shrimp roll are on the salty side but lobster is just right!the soup is at ok level but rolls are amazing!no lines at pm on labor day.
652,Tonya M.,1114,5,2/1/18,we ate here on my birthday and i was not disappointed! the dining area is small but i figure most people get theirs to go for lunch. we each had the lobster roll and it was fantastic! reasonable price for the quality of food too. would absolutely go back when in nyc again.
653,Shea M.,1114,4,8/11/17,pretty good food! portions were kind of smaller than initially expected but still good food. i had a lobster roll with some bbq chips on the side with a lemon line drink. yum!
654,Genevieve L.,1114,4,2/13/18,"i wanted to try this place out since i've heard so many good things! my friend and i got the trio and the lobster mac and cheese to share. the staff was really friendly and helpful. they have happy hour everyday on drinks from pm for those who like to wind down after work.for tourists, this is really close to the charging bull and fearless girl! about a minute walk give or take. even though the portions are small luke's is definitely worth a try if you are in town. it is no maine but probably the best you will get in the city."
655,He Z.,1114,5,5/15/18,"freshcatch lobster, with simple n sweet preparation, offering you marvellous taste, which may redefine your concept about seafood. the salad n soup also worth a try, no fancy layout or mysterious recipe, just healthy, inseason materials served with their utmost original flavour. this shop definitely top my recommendation list."
656,Alice Z.,1114,5,8/29/17,"the taste of maine from luke's lobster is the perfect option to try if you cannot decide on what seafood to get. if includes crab, lobster, and shrimp roll, and comes with chips and a drink. the rolls are crispy and buttery, and the seafood is fresh and perfectly seasoned. my favorite out of the had to be the lobster roll, and they give out generous portions on seafood in their rolls. the service was great, and i loved the nautical theme of the restaurant."
657,Jack K.,1114,5,6/9/18,the food here was great. the lobster roll was the best of the trio sampler. do not think you can split your order with someone as the portion is not enough to split. the lobster crab shrimp was a chilled version. i would have preferred hot. the staff was friendly and service was quick.
658,Ken P.,1114,5,6/15/17,"ambience picture the old style lobster shack on the docks along us in maine. crowded and hectic especially at peak lunchtime but well worth the wait.food so far i've had their shrimp roll, the crab roll and the lobster roll on separate occasions . the shrimp and crab rolls were above average but not perfect. say out of for either yet still well worth the price. the lobster roll is a delight . chunks of tender lobster meat in a buttered new england style roll. a definite ."
659,Scooter M.,1114,4,4/16/18,"well, i'm going over some of my reviews and thinking back to my trip to new york and i upped this place to four stars. i've been thinking about how delicious the lobster itself was and how fresh, and i was put off by the fact that it was served ice cold and for me i'm poor how exorbitant the price was for so little food. i'm thinking that this was unfair. if you are not put off by the price, or that the lobsters cold, you might really enjoy this place! the staff was super friendly and the decor is cute. lobster itself was absolutely delicious."
660,Chris H.,1114,5,1/23/18,"amazing beyond belief. coming from the south east, i doubted the quality. i was set straight at the first bite! amazing trio with the crab roll being my personal favorite. had the bisque that was off the chart. i would fly back to nyc just to eat here!!!"
661,Lindsi G.,1114,4,4/24/18,"sought out a lobster lunch spot after getting off the staten island ferry ride. lobster roll and lobster bisque were both great. staff was super friendly, too, and the place was pretty empty at pm on a tuesday. took off a star for the size to price disproportionality. i'm happy to pay for a solid lobster roll, but this one could have been % bigger for the price. otherwise had a great experience!"
662,David F.,1114,5,12/9/17,"wow. really, wow.i do not have a lot of experience with lobster rolls, but given my experience at luke's i'm going to dive in to this world.i did not expect the lobster to be cold in the roll but after a few bites it was clear that this is the way god intended it. an excellent butter salty seasoning of some kind soaked the thing it was excellent.i had a large bowl of lobster bisque as well also excellent with a nice chunk of lobster meat in the bottom. they apparently buy the soup from some company in maine but i'm pretty sure they put the fresh crab in it.its more of a grab and go place a few places to sit but its not like a date place.excellent"
663,Ivy C.,1114,5,9/29/18,nice place! super fresh lobster roll and crab roll also.definitely a must check if you are around
664,Stephanie H.,1114,5,5/27/17,"awesome lobster rolls, whole claws and chunks of tail. they are lightly dressed so that it really highlights the lobster. i always trended towards less is more when it comes to real quality ingredients. hiding it in mayo, butter, and salt is totally a trick to hide things going bad. but luke's lobster has superb quality ingredients. it was so so delicious that i'm already craving another one. we got one as a snack while my mom and i were walking around manhattan after a week of dreary weather, the sun finally broke through and we wanted to take advantage of it. this was the perfect snack!"
665,Michael J.,1114,5,3/25/18,"visiting from ca just got off the very chilly liberty ellis island boat and needed a good seafood warmup! had the lobster roll, mac & cheese and lobster bisque. omg!! everything was amazing!!!"
666,Dawny M.,1114,4,7/24/17,"come for the lobster roll. small, limited seating. perfect to grab a quick lunch bite. i gave it a only because the chowder was not the best. service was friendly and attentive even though it is a serve yourself place."
667,Marc G.,1114,4,7/19/17,"small place. really small. but somehow they have made the atmosphere welcoming. the staff is great and the lobster roll is delicious. do i wish it was bigger well. yeah, of course. and maybe a little cheaper that, too.but when you are craving a lobber roll in nyc, hit one of luke's multiple locations. i have not been disappointed on three different visits!"
668,Linda L.,1114,4,2/24/18,"decided to check out this place after visiting the statue of liberty since this location is close by battery park. got here at pm on a saturday and surprisingly no line. my bf and i order the lobster roll and lobster mac n cheese. both were delicious. just be warn portions are quite small. i expected this and did not want to be too full in order to try other things in nyc. definitely a must try lobster roll. you get good chunks of lobster meat! plus one star for price. we paid for things, mindful they are for lobster."
669,Desiree H.,1114,5,9/18/18,oh so good. staff was no nice and accommodating. i cannot eat bread and got a salad with the trio meats. yum!
670,Mia W.,1114,3,6/5/17,"does not travel wellthis was my first trip to luke's lobster and probably my last. my experience was much better than the actual lobster roll.the restaurant is quite small, but very adorable. the decor is very shipie. the cashier was very polite and helpful, but this is where my gushing ends.i ordered the trio lobster roll, shrimp roll, crab roll but requested that the shrimp roll be replaced with another lobster roll. when i got back to my hotel room hungry and ready to chow down i discover that they gave me three lobster rolls. insert gasp i guess i do not get to taste the crab roll.also, the rolls do not travel well, so eat them right there. the bun is warm and buttery and wonderful, but the lobster is ice cold, so what you get is a luke warm bun with a buttery film on your tongue.i see the potential, but something did not quite work."
671,Tony D.,1114,5,11/30/17,"when it comes to lobster rolls, luke's are the best. the lobster is fresh and the roll is simple, so the flavor of the lobster really shines through. i've tried the crab and shrimp rolls as well. all are good, but the shrimp was my least favorite. the portions are not that large, so you will need to either order more than roll or something else to go with it. i went with the luke's trio."
672,Ryan M.,1114,2,5/7/17,"it was for a lobster roll and a side of slaw. i was surprised to find that the lobster is served cold on a warm buttered toasted hot dog bun. the taste was good but honestly i had high hopes for this bite of grub and it kinda let me down. it would have been expensively worth it at but is way too much. find somewhere else to spend your cash. also the drink selection was terrible and they did not even have ice for a water. the restaurant was too small for it is own good. there were only a few tables and we had to use the bar along the wall, which did not have open seats available. i would suggest going somewhere different."
673,Scott T.,1114,4,7/13/18,"my first lobster roll. it was good but did not expect the lobster to be chilled. nice place, good location."
674,E K.,1114,5,7/20/18,hands down the best lobster roll i have ever had! i have had what i consider amazing lobster rolls at chelsea market lobster place and in connecticut particularly new london but i really think luke's takes the cake for lobster roll! incidentallybut i also think indicative of their philosophy and excellent service and foodi stumbled on them on a recent trip to philadelphia and branched out to crab roll special of the day at the suggestion of the server and it was amazing as well. even if there is a line it moves fast thanks to friendly and efficient staff
675,Zhijian J.,1114,4,9/4/17,the lobster is many and fresh and tender. and the bread has crispy she will. but a little tasteless for me.maybe you could order a green bee honey soda.
676,Franco Z.,1114,5,12/24/17,"the portion is not as big as i imagined, however, the taste is incredible and it worths the price. location is not hard to find."
677,Mai P.,1114,4,6/14/17,"alright so do not get me wrong. the lobster roll is delicious!!! but for , it is really hard to justify the size. see my picture and hand for comparison. the lobster was super juicy, and the bread was so buttery and soft. if you are one of those people who can drop on a meal no drinks or sides included , then the food is great."
678,Alex D.,1114,3,4/13/18,the portions are pretty small. very comparable to tapas style food. the food was good. had the lobster roll and my friend had the trio. i liked the bread the rolls were served on too. bread was toasted and very tasty. i would say the pricing for the portions is a bit expensive. for the lobster roll. that is my only knock on them.
679,Andrew C.,1114,4,3/13/18,"i love getting food here despite the fact it is a good min walk, plus like today when it was a mix of rain and snow i still came out and walked the trek of horrid hotness and sweating. stars because i nearly broke a tooth in the crab roll because there was a dingdangdoodly she will in my roll, props otherwise"
680,Katharine W.,1114,5,4/27/18,great lobster rolls and lobster bisque! the flavor of the lobster is scrumptious and paired with a buttery not too thick roll makes eating this roll an amazing experience! will definitely visit this place again when in the financial district!
681,Emily C.,1114,5,2/16/18,"update my mistake was not going for the lobster roll. the lobster roll was amazing and perfectly seasoned. i'm a big bisque fan and that is the reason why i went for the bisque. the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. legen wait for it dary.i had the lobster bisque, and i've had better. i also order the a lobster tail, and it was bland. there was no flavor, and after eating the lobster bisque, it did not settle well. i'm drinking ginger ale hoping it helps my stomach. the service there was great, the people working there were friendly."
682,Brian G.,1114,1,6/9/18,"we ordered two lobster rolls takeout at a piece and was quit disappointed. it lacked freshness, the rolls tasted like they have been sitting there for hours, the same as when you toast bread, leave it in the refrigerator, then take it out for several hours. lobster tasted anything but fresh. it is not a reflection of the service but the product and ownership should be more cognizant of serving a better product even at that price range, and to label anything in their establishment as maine is deceiving since they tasted more like they were from gristedes. stars. go elsewhere."
683,Marj B.,1114,4,9/9/18,"friendly staff, prompt service. lobster roll was excellentlotsa really fresh lobster. clam chowder was tasty, too."
684,Jon W.,1114,4,6/12/16,"luke's lobster just became my lobster!these lobster rolls are the lobster roll standard the perfect amount of lobster to mayo to roll they just do it right here.when you get into this tiny spot everything is wood and has the feeling of stepping on to a ship like you are about to go catch some lobsters . argghg mate!i got the lobster roll combo that comes with a lobster roll, chips or cole slaw, pickle, and any non alcoholic drink.the blueberry lemonade was calling my name for the drink and it was really sweet from the honey they put in, but had a nice level of blueberry to melo it out.the lobster roll was awesome and tasty with every bit but you just eat it so fast because it is kind of small my co worker bought two.the service was super quick and walk outside as there was a bunch of seating outside to catch some rays while i ate.in short great lunch spot quick order food friendly staff a little pricey expect to spend at least after tax"
685,C K.,1114,4,5/17/18,"the lobster roll and crab roll were delish. shrimp was ok in my book . the staff was friendly and accommodating. however, they did say we could sit at a table in the alley. i'm sure they did not know, but when we tried to sit at the tables in the alley, we were not welcome per the wait staff of the restaurants there . a little obnoxious from the dubliner.there were many empty tables. anyway, the rolls are great.get some now!"
686,Zinan X.,1114,4,5/4/17,"i can see why people are in love with this place fresh ingredients, friendly people and nice vibe, and i like it too, just not a star like.i got the lobster roll and the shrimp roll, they were pretty small, i still felt a bit hungry after eating both. they were not really too flavorful, although they tasted refreshing, and since i'm big on the flavor of food in terms of rating, i'm going to take a star out."
687,Garrett F.,1114,4,5/29/16,"i was hungry and craving seafood, so i turned to yelp and ended up at luke's lobster.food i could not decide, so i ordered both the lobster and crab roll.they were both really tasty!i liked the lobster roll more because when eating the crab roll, i would occasionally bite into shells.sides notesambiance the restaurant is super small. i ate at luke's lobster around p.m. on a weekday and there was only one person eating. i bet it gets packed during lunch, though!service the staff was super nice i felt like they gave me their honest recommendations.overall if you are craving seafood, stop on by!"
688,Karen K.,1114,1,11/2/17,"a bit disappointed. looks are definitely deceiving. the reviews on here are old & the menu has changed. i had the luke's trio which includes of all three crab, shrimp, lobster. do not waste your money. they are small & i found the crab meat to be super salty, the lobster roll was tasteless not like your normal lobster roll. before they a trio that included all three with a drink, side of chips and or pickle which costed more but i'm assuming worth it. before . now . honestly the best part or the rolls was the buttery toasted buns. my coworker had a cold drink that is was pretty gross in her words. they do have a lobster mac & cheese that i wanted to try but after today's experience i might just take that thought back!"
689,Rachel M.,1114,1,10/28/17,"i just stopped by luke's for a shrimp roll for lunch after reading such great reviews. a bottle of water, a bag of chips, and one shrimp roll cost me . . i leave the shop to go eat it on a park bench, and open up the container to find the most disappointing, and rather disgusting looking shrimp roll. the shrimp are small, cold, overcooked and basically just pink mush inside of a squished hot dog bun. it is extremely disappointing and compared to the raving reviews, i'm extremely confused as to why people return here if this is how you are going to be ripped off."
690,Shelia E.,1114,1,10/18/17,this was the place i chose to have dinner for my birthday.very disappointed. who serves cold anything on warm toast. the soup was the best thing i ordered. do not recommend
691,Guilherme M.,1114,1,4/20/17,really over priced. the lobster tail is the same size as a jumbo shrimp.they have good sodas tho
692,Jackie A.,1114,1,8/17/16,i got the lobster roll which had very little lobster meat. it was not worth the . i would never return here. i was upset that i spent such money and did not get my worth. i was still hungry after eating the roll.
693,Ck T.,1114,1,7/20/16," . tasteless. lobster, shrimp and crab roll, all of them are tasteless. no favor of seafood. need lots of pepper to add some taste . super expenseive, you pay usd to for a tiny roll with quarter pound lobster"
694,Natalie P.,1114,1,6/20/16,"shockingly bad value for money. we ordered a taste of maine, getting roll of each of the specialties lobster shrimp crab. the portion size even of the was insulting, at !! the fillings were ice cold, flavorless and demonstrated no effort other than toasting the bread. very disappointed."
695,Kyle B.,1114,1,6/12/16,"i used to come to this luke's often, however, i will never return due to their declining food quality and terrible customer service.my lobster roll came without butter or mayo. i took two bites then realized it the lobster and bread was completely dry. i realize people make mistakes, so brought it back to be replaced with one that does have all the ingredients. andrew the manager on duty refused to fix it or replace it with another one since i had taken a bite and even ventured to argue with me that it probably did have mayo, even before taking a look. i've been here + times so i know their standards, and it also looked completely different than my wife's.after arguing for minutes, it was only after i told andrew i would be calling his boss in the morning that he even offered to give me a partial refund. not even a full refund!luke's i used to love your food. but you have lost a longtime customer in me."
696,Phillysgirl 3.,1114,1,12/30/15,"first, i just wasted . on this food. although they had a great idea when coming up with this, unfortunately they are lacking. second, they are way too expensive for the average person who is on a budget.i would have loved to have tried the lobster roll, except it was . just for the roll. from the looks of the amount of lobster while waiting for my order to be ready, i was glad i did not get the lobster roll. extremely skimpy. unfortunately, the best bet for me financially was to order the shrimp roll with the soup combo, and by shrimp, i mean baby shrimp wha whaaaaa . i could not believe how small the shrimp were.i can tell you that i am writing this review directly after eating my lunch from luke's and i am still hungry. not only was the shrimp roll insignificant and way to much money for what you get, but it was tasteless. the only good thing out of the entire meal was the new england clam chowder, and i have had better.i am sorry luke's lobster.you will have to make some changes before i ever darken your door step again.oh and by the way.do not believe the pics you see here on yelp, as images appear larger than they truly are.at least concerning luke's lobster anyway.good luck!"
697,David L.,1114,1,6/24/15,"i like luke's lobster, but i hate this location. since the first tiny storefront opened in the east village opened a few years ago, i have been a regular at their various locations, and unfortunately, the one nearest where i actually live is my least favorite. by far. the employees are rude & inattentive. the employees are aloof & condescending. the employees are unhelpful & unapproachable. today was my last attempt."
698,Jon S.,1114,1,6/19/15,"tried luke's lobster as i've heard good things about it from the hoboken community. went in, nice little shop with about menu options. i order the lobster roll. , which is standard for a lobster roll in nyc and surrounding areas. the roll is delivered to my table and it is literally a hot dog bun with lobster on it. no lettuce, no mayo, no french fries or cole slaw. it tasted very bland with the only condiment in the store being siracha. i finished the roll and then headed over to panera because i was left both hungry and unsatisfied. would not go again"
699,John R.,1114,1,12/11/14,"if i could give less than one star, i would.the thing is, the food was ok.for appetizers, but for the fact that the portions are not even big enough for frodo baggins and the fellowship of the ring.if the price would have been a of what we paid.then ok. but for a grilled cheese and large clam chowder in a oz cup was a joke."
700,Luke H.,1114,1,8/26/13,"i am absolutely shocked this place is rated so highly. this is so absurd that i had to create a yelp account to make my first review, upon stumbling upon how highly regarded this place is. months ago, i found several pieces of coarse, curly pubic hair sitting conveniently on the surface of my lobster roll. so plainly in view, there is no way this could not have been deliberate. i bring the food back to the counter to ask for it to be remade, but on hindsight, i definitely should have just asked for a refund.the employees tried their hardest not to bust out laughing when they saw the specimen. the price is ridiculous. especially considering the majority of the meat was lobster claw. i found zero lobster tail meat. what kind of lobster roll is that "
701,J. J.,1114,1,7/7/13,elw expensive & long wait.no excuse for a lobster roll.
702,Daniel A.,1114,2,11/1/18,"this place is overrated no flavor what so over! i've had way better lobster rolls for a better price. it is literally bread and lobster. really add mayo, tarragon, some spices, maybe some bacon to make it taste good. and the clam chowder tasted funny! the prices are also a little to much for a tiny sandwich! never again!"
703,Anna X.,1114,2,9/20/18,"not very consistent in terms of preparation and taste. the last time i came here the rolls were on the spot, but this time they were really disappointing. the bread was cold and not buttery like it usually is. the crab meat was also not buttery and was just tasteless. i am having trouble finishing it as i type. sad cuz i've been craving it for a while, went out of my way to get it, and it did not even taste good. not something you would just throw away because of the price. very disappointed "
704,Antonio S.,1114,2,7/13/18,"portions are tiny, waiting time is crazy long. i went in today and ordered a crab roll a small corn chowder and a glass of beer. it came to a total of . the roll was tiny and did not have much flavor. there was a fair amount of crab meat but it really was not seasoned. the corn chowder was tasty but again the portion was tiny for . the beer was ok. i do not know if i will go back, not sure it is worth the price or massive waste of time."
705,Nelya K.,1114,2,5/22/18,"the rolls are tiny. our food came cold and slightly frozen. however, the lobster and crab tasted fresh and the slaw was yummy."
706,Vivian L.,1114,2,3/11/18,"while visiting ny from los angeles san diego ca , my friend and i decided to try this place based on the great reviews. i saw quite a few that were hesitant about the price but frankly, for a lobster roll is pretty typical so, undaunted by the pricing, we went in with high expectations and boy were we sadly disappointed. it was the tiniest and blandest lobster roll i have ever had. the description told of the lobster being flavored lemon butter and their secret seasoning , but i did not taste any lemon, butter, or seasoning. i could not even taste any of the natural sweetness lobster meat usually has. and i'm not sure if this is typical of east coast lobster rolls but instead of the thick, buttery, toasty bread i'm used to, it just seemed like a regular slice of bread that was slightly toasted and used to wrap the lobster. i also got the clam chowder, which was flavored nicely, but the clam bits had the texture of having been frozen and thawed too many times. would not recommend this place nor would i want to come back for more."
707,Katherine J.,1114,2,1/23/18,"my roommates and i were craving some lobster and mac and cheese one saturday night and saw how good the reviews were for luke's lobster. i've also heard about the chain a lot so thought this would be a good time to check it out and fulfill a craving.we all individually got our own lobster rolls and then shared a lobster mac and cheese. couple takeaways the good the mac and cheese was yummy, the noodles themselves were really good so bites without lobsters were still v delicious. i liked the crunch added on top so there was some texture instead of mush in your mouth. lobster in the lobster roll was generous and sweet. because they did not mask the lobster with lots of salt, butter, or mayonnaise like they usually do in lobster rolls, i felt that the restaurant definitely had some pride in the quality of their lobster. whenever i get something that is slathered in sauce or butter, i feel like they are hiding something.the bad to address my above point honestly the lobster rolls needed more seasoning. the bread def needed to be toasted with more butter, and the lobster itself actually could have benefited from more mayo butter and salt. while i appreciated the presentation of the lobster in such a simple way, it would have been way more delicious if the roll was more flavorful. the mac and cheese was tiny oh my god when it came out i actually just looked at it in shock.the ok, you are in fidi, you want a lobster roll and therefore you definitely know you are going to drop some on this meal. however for a lobster roll oh my goodness and it does not even come with anything also if you had to blow on a meal, i would recommend so many other places before eating a lobster roll so really only eat here to indulge a very specific lobster craving you should not be having. the mac and cheese was . . . . ok if this was a huge mac and cheese with tons of lobster, i would understand. but if i just ordered the mac and cheese alone without the lobster roll and just for myself, i would honestly be starving afterwards still. objectively i am not a big person nor do i have a huge appetite, but the portion was so tiny i was literally speechless from shock when it arrived.basically i'm not going to come back, unless i have a very specific craving for lobster again. not bad, but the portion sizes and eh flavor are not worth it for the price."
708,Pet S.,1114,2,12/30/17,"teenytiny portions, you need four of their rolls to get any close to being full. expensive for the size. food was okay not great. i regret going."
709,Lily Z.,1114,2,5/19/17,"i get this is ny and everything will be pricier, but spending for two people for mediocre food is not right. we ordered rolls, clam chowder, and drinks. i got the one where you can have a taste of the crab, lobster, and crab rolls. my husband got just the lobster roll. they were all incredibly small, and we left still feeling hungry. the lobster rolls on the east coast maine, boston are way better and the standard in terms of lobster rolls."
710,Malena M.,1114,2,3/31/17,"slow slow slow, definitely not a quick lunch place. min lunch. got bisque instead of clam chowder. luke wherever and whoever you are, you need to come in and streamline this operation!!!"
711,Damian M.,1114,2,2/5/17,a decent lobster roll but certainly not the stars it is rated at on yelp. very small portion for the hefty price. that is a pass for me.
712,Guillaume T.,1114,2,1/29/17,"over ranked for plain lobster crab roles, with average flavors and quantities. not bad, not much!"
713,Micah S.,1114,2,6/1/16,"ok i give up i have been ranting about underserving star reviews for long enough and now i get it it is me. stars means something to me and i'm always suspicious of a small number of reviews, all of which are stars, but this place has tons of reviews and a large balance are stars. my review will therefor not include fingerwagging for the star crowd who cannot possibly believe that stars should be reserved for the outlandishly awesome, never had better, value conscious nyc food consumer. yes, the d ] c cor is charming and the staff is very nice, but for a tiny lobster roll and a bottle of water with chips c'mon. to not mention the lack of bang for buck is to be someone who has money to burn i do not have that kind of dough, esp. for lunch. the options in this neighborhood for good great quality lunch at the same or similar price and, no less, at sitdown places with wait service are too many to be ignored. i know what lobster rolls are and if you have never had one you will always be disappointed at their lilliputian dimensions, but, still for a three bite lunch at a take away place with no meaningful seating is just beyond crazy to me. if you have got money to burn, light the fire. otherwise, take one step to the left for a delish and reasonably priced vietnamese sandwich, or walk half a block in any direction and your money will go farther for equal taste and d ] c cor. what lobster was in the bread was good that much has to be said."
714,Chloe G.,1114,2,3/19/16,"i was so excited to try luke's lobster. i've heard only great things lobster is fresh, great selection, cool environment.when i walked in, i scanned the menu written on a black board on the wall . seemed like a good varietyrolls, grilled cheese, yum. after ordering, my food was ready in less than a minute i ordered the lobster roll combocomes with chips or slaw and a drink . the roll looked pretty good. the bread was nice and toasted, lobster was cold and had some type of seasoning sprinkled on top.first bite was okay lobster was a little bland. when i started to go in for my second bite, i noticed there were some weird milkycolored chunks of something.at first i thought it was a vegetable but after taking a bite of one it had a consistence like a super overcooked vegetable. i shrugged it off and picked those pieces out of the roll. next two bites had big pieces of lobster she will.not so fun to have to pick those out of my mouth. another bite had sand! totally turned me off and i could not continue eating the roll. i was so bummed because i heard such great things, and saw great reviews here on yelp.the slaw was okay.had a nice vinegary flavor. they have a great selection of sodai tried the blueberry honey lemonade, which i really enjoyed.i am not the type to be super picky about casual food, but the sand, she will, and mysterious milky white chunks were just not acceptable.overall i would not recommend this location, but am going to try another luke's lobster."
715,Ebony C.,1114,2,2/6/16,"i've never had a lobster roll. it was disappointing. it was cold, bland, teeny portions and gave my entire family the runs. i have nothing else to really say about this place. it was a nice space but the food lacked flavor."
716,Xiaoning F.,1114,2,10/2/15,ultra small size. dollars can buy me two great lobster tails and a bread and i can make a far more delicious one at home. still hungry after a meal.
717,Matt P.,1114,2,9/19/15,"maybe i would not have been so disappointed if i had not gone to cull & pistol a few days earlier, but this just was not anywhere near as good. it was like the old joke the food here is terrible, and such small portions . a tiny bit of slightlyoff dishwatertasting lobster on a roll with a bag of chips. the staff seems vaguely annoyed that you have been rude enough to order food from them. it is cheaper than some of the other lobster roll places in ny, but not half as cheap and not half as good. luke's is to lobster what burger king is to steak."
718,Katie F.,1114,2,9/2/15,"beware of unauthorized charges! the cashier at luke's lobster took the liberty of adding on a tip on my bill and a tip on my colleague's bill. they have a delicious lobster roll, but the unethical behavior left a bad taste in my mouth. if you do go here, i would strongly recommend paying with cash!"
719,Kamran N.,1114,2,7/16/15,this is not a food review as we did not eat at this restaurant we wanted to have dinner and order noah arc with slaw but they did not have slaw and only other option was potato. as we were on diet we asked if we can have soup instead and she simply declined and did not offer alternatives. some level of flexibility and feeling welcome is something any decent restaurant should offer. we walked out disappointed mins ago and i felt so strongly about the arrogance that decided to write this review.
720,Jill M.,1114,2,6/19/15,"i'm from maine, so maybe that explains it, but i was very disappointed with this lobster roll from the truck, so maybe better in the restaurant . it was not very flavorful and the butter had sort of condensed on the lobster. if you have never had lobster before, it would be fine, but i will not be coming back to the truck."
721,Robert G.,1114,2,5/1/15,food was okay but for the price was not worth it. the lobster roll was petite to say the least. i would say it was the right portion for a toddler. not worth for a kids meal.
722,J L.,1114,2,12/18/14,"a couple of my friends had been raving about luke's, so i decided to give it a try note this review refers only to the s. william st. location . i went in with the excitement of a rosyeyed yelp reader, expecting great things of their taste of maine sample platter, as so many before me had doneand enjoyed enough to become regular customers.boy was i disappointed.first off, these rolls are the size of a pig in a blanketand i mean kolaches, not your friendly barn animal. i could literally fit these sample bits in the palm of my hand. second, they were practically tasteless. try throwing some canned baby shrimp on a piece of buttered toastyou may get better results! actually, that roll in particular tasted more like a fishy salt lick than a sandwich. i could not believe the poor quality of these rolls. i've been to lobster shacks in maine and, believe me, they are not comparable. further, as someone who lived in boston for five years, believe me when i say steer clear of luke's if you are looking for an authentic maine lobster experience. eaters beware!"
723,Rick A.,1114,2,11/3/14,"all the yelp ratings and hype were the reason why myself and other co workers decided to go . first of all , the size of the sandwich is the as long as your thumb for . secondly the lobster is cold i prefer it hot . for the quantity and price i do not think ill be ever going back . beware with all the reviewers may be ghost posters paid by the company.also, restaurant size is the same as my living room !!!"
724,Prianka I.,1114,2,8/9/14,"i work in the area and have passed by this place many times while scouring for things to eat during my lunch hour. i'm not by all means a lobster roll connoisseur, but i was spoiled by the deliciousness of the lobster place in chelsea and have been struck by random cravings for lobster rolls lately. so why not splurge once in a while for lunch, right the restaurant is small and cozy, reminiscent of a new england lobster shack. i ordered a lobster roll, waited for about minutes then went on my merry way to devour this snack. to my utter disappointment, this snack did not live up the hype. the lobster was indeed fresh, but flavorless. it was also tinier than other lobster rolls i've had or maybe i'm delusional . i expected bursts of butter or whatever it is that they put in lobster rolls, but i tasted nothing i personally do not like the overly crisp buns, so that was an issue as well. honestly if i had this lobster roll as my first time i would not think lobster rolls are gifts from heaven. maybe this is what typical lobster rolls are like in maine plain and boring but i'm not a fan. i knew i was not going to be full from one, but i at least expected satisfaction! definitely not worth the expensive price."
725,Paul I.,1115,5,6/26/18,"my fiancee and i were visiting new york city hopping around the city enjoying several libations and taking in the town us being california natives . suddenly, hunger struck like a villain of hell's kitchen deliberately trying to ruin our night. we instantly thought of ramen to be our hero. we took to instagram to poll our social audience to see which ramen spot they would recommend. overwhelmingly it was totto.totto luckily was around the corner and this is where our journey actually was just beginning. we started with some pork buns and sake. the sake was the perfect appetite wetter and the pork buns were very enjoyable. then, out of nowhere, we were blessed with a bowl of the mega paitan. it sported perfectly cooked al dente ramen noodles, chicken paitan, char siu pork, pork belly chunks, and a solft boiled egg.the broth was rich. the meat was tender. the egg was beautiful. great experience! highly recommend. thank you totto, thank you.cheers!"
726,Trina V.,1115,5,5/19/18,"love it!this restaurant is pretty tiny. from what i can see, there is a handful of bar seats and couple of tables in the back. so be prepared to wait. i'm assuming the best time to go is right when they open both for lunch and dinner.write your name on the clip board and wait for them to take your order. like ramen parlor, you order while you wait and it is ready for you when you are seated.the bf and i got spicy pakistan you have a choice between pork and chicken. i ended up getting the pork. the broth does not look or taste spicy at first, but the spice definitely builds up. reminds me of the kind of spice you get from ramen parlor's lobster broth. mega paitan this one comes with char siu pork and pork belly. the char siu was delicious, but the pork belly was amazing. it just fell apart and melted in your mouth. bf loves daikokuya and he said it is comparable to their ramen.it is even better because it is a mix of the two ramen places that we love.overall, the broths, noodles, and meats were great. a definite must try if you are in the area."
727,Tina C.,1115,3,9/3/18,"on labor day we were looking for a good ramen place. we chose toto to satisfy our craving. we arrived around pm, which is prime dinner time. unfortunately there was a line but i do appreciate how organized the wait was. they add your name to a list and will inform you when seating is available for your party.the restaurant is very small i think is the smallest ramen restaurant i have ever eaten at! there really is not really anywhere you can wait except on the sidewalk. the stoop right by the restaurant is a residential property which has a sign hanging, prohibiting sitting there. i do appreciate how they try to operate efficiently. while we waited we were given a menu so we could order ahead of time.our party of two was seated on the bar on tall stools. there were hooks behind us to hang up your coat. but there was no hook for my purse. i never place it on the floor so i had to awkwardly place it in my lap. the stool had no back, so i could not place it behind me as i was seated. when i looked into the back of the restaurant, i did not see that many tables. it was also very dimly lit this makes me sleepy!! lol .being seated at the bar meant that i had a great view of the kitchen. i like to watch people prepare food, so that kept me well entertained as i waited. we ordered the pork buns, and a bowl of ramen each. pork buns were a great appetizer moist pork rich in sauce flavor, with a nice soft bun. ramen was okay chicken bowl , portions are average but unfortunately the ramen did not impress me. i have heard great things about this establishment, but i tasted nothing that blew me out of this world. bathroom was hidden behind a sliding wooden door and was clean. overall just an okay experience. this is a cash only place as well, so bring the bills no apple pay, no credit cards ."
728,Joe D.,1115,5,10/13/18,"totto is literally the greatest ramen i have ever had!me and my girlfriend have been there almost times, and every single time, the same order we always get extra spicy paitan with pork and a seasoned boiled egg, an avocado bun and a pork bun are amazing.the broth and whatever base is used has such a great taste. it is almost hard to explain.everything is always cooked perfectly, and the bowls are huge! the pork bun is phenomenal as well. i could eat !we will probably be back again next week."
729,Kate E.,1115,4,6/17/18,"delicious!! + stars! i may update to as i complete my ramen tour. i view stars as the one to hit for a weekend so wait and see.went with the spicy chicken bowl but spice on the side and add the egg a must for all ramen! others in my party did the same order but included the spice. tip i think i got more because it was on the side. but the presentation is not as pretty so a trade off. definitely need the spice and standard amount is perfect. they have this down.bring cash and be prepared to eat somewhat quickly. it is all worth it, i promise!! the flavor is fantastic and we all agreed the best noodles we have ever had.tip i went on a saturday mid afternoon and there was no wait."
730,Karen L.,1115,5,10/12/18,"ramen is my comfort food in my dictionary. i travelled to new york city, i absolutely want some japanese food. i searched totto ramen from yelp and their ratings are very awesome. so it took is to have minutes wait, we have highexpectation due to the waiting duration time. and it did not disappoint us at all. ramen is super delicious and it is good in size. i feel like i am in tokyo when i went into the noodle bar. the location is easy to find as a tourist of myself."
731,Jess S.,1115,5,10/28/18,"i had the spicy chicken paitan. mushrooms added. and a sapporo. excellent flavors and portion size. i went solo around p on a sunday and was able to get in immediately at the bar. you write your name and partysize on a list outside the entrance. very tiny, cozy spot. the lines and wait are so long because of this and the popularity i suspect. the hostess and my waitress checked on me for a total of times, the perfect amount in my mind. cash only, great price points. check it out!"
732,Long N.,1115,2,4/16/18,"let us start off with the bad and end good i guess.venue tiny, as most nyc places, it was cramped but not only that, they really try to squeeze you in there just to make that extra bowl of money. not the cleanest of places, grungy looking. the wait is always long, i've been multiple times, during the cold season they cannot even get a small heater outside for their waiting customers, that is how cheap they are.service what service ! it is all about cranky people in and out without any courtesy. the more bowls they can make the more money. we got sat in the far back corner with a shared table, that is great we get to make friends. the other folks ended up leaving so we scooted in so that the next group had a place to sit without moving in and out. we got told to move and forced us to literally sit in the walkway of an already cramped restaurant so not only did we not get to enjoy our meal fully, but people kept excusing themselves to move behind us constantly. i think that is a sign to cut down on the number of seats or expand the venue. the service was very rude when we brought up this idea as if it was absurd. we were trying to create less burden on all parties, they just wanted to make more seats for more money.payment it is unfortunately cash only. another inconvenience they purposefully choose as this saves them money, fees, new equipment, etc. we gave our cash and suppose to get back but instead they kept the and gave us back two s and a . so they expected us to give the as tip and they already kept the . the party next to us even noticed and thought it was absurd they would do that, at least break the if they wanted to keep the .ramen the best part of this experience was not even that great. i've been here once before and got a different bowl which was good, this time it was also good, but man was the char siu not at all tender. it was very tough in fact for everyone, so maybe it was the batch of pork but the soup at the end of the day was still delicious and i got the extra spicy ramen so got to spice up my broth as much as i wanted. food was a star but everything else was less hence the rating.honestly, next time we will go to ippudo around the corner for a larger space, much better service, and just as good of ramen, better apps! will not be back, happy eating."
733,Mei L.,1115,3,7/24/18,"so my boss has been raving about this place as a place i have need to try as i am a big ramen fan, but i am a picky ramen fan. i usually have high expectations, as there are so many ramen places popping up, but i grade the bowl of ramen based on broth, noodles, toppings and service. i got the spicy paitan a with pork char shu.broth rich and creamy, had a good amount of flavor for being a chicken based compare to pork based ramen. noodles my ramen came with straight noodles, which i like as much as the curly, but it seems a little over cooked. at ippudo's, you can get it cooked a certain way and i like my noodles a little chewier. toppings it was topped with bran sprouts and green onions sliced the long way. i know that not all ramen places put the same toppings, but for the basic without add ons seems a little lacking. i would have like some bamboo shoots, wood ear mushroom, etc. the add on would have cost much more than the ramen itself . also it did not come with a ramen egg for the spicy one i got.additionally, the pork was a little dry for me and could have braised a little more but that is just me . service we got seated at the bar quickly and the server was super nice. we left a nice tip. i also did get the pork buns and it was braised well, but i do like ippudo's buns more.overall, the experience was good, and this place is a solid place to eat at price is good but when i compare it to other ramen places as a whole, it falls in my expectations a little. maybe if i get the chicken paitan without the spicy as the spicy has more pepper than spicy. i did taste it before mixing and the first sip without the spicy was delicious."
734,Ileana M.,1115,3,5/30/18,"while i resent the fact that the soups come with very few toppings and that adding toppings makes the price skyrocket , this is certainly the best ramen broth i've ever had. i was smiling like an idiot at the first sip of my miso paitan it was that good. i was disappointed, however, that my egg was cooked through since i'm used to soft yolks in ramen.went on a sunday night at around and waited for about minutes party of . they took our order in line so we got to eat almost as soon as we sat down.long story short, do not go for good toppings or a good ambiance. go for that good broth."
735,Annette L.,1115,5,5/5/18,"wowww totto ramen really surprised me.btw this is the original and totto ramen next door is the tonkotsu sister restaurant.honestly i was skeptical about eating chicken ramen bc i've only had tonkotsu aka pork being from california & spoiled with menya ultra and orenchi . the sound of chicken ramen sounded. healthy cringe but i was very wrong. it was amazing. a must try when in nyc.food extra spicy chicken paitan with chicken, option of chicken meat or pork ~ a perfect bowl of ramen! the spicy sauce similar to a saute sauce comes on the side. the soup was flavorful with a balance between salty and fatty on the lighter side of fat compared to tonkotsu but will not leave you feeling heavy . the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente ask if you want more cooked . the chicken was sooooooo good. it was not dry at all but it was not too salty or fatty either. please teach me how to cook my chicken like this ah.miso paitan comes with half a boiled egg, ground pork, bean sprouts, and a choice of char siu or chicken. was not as huge of a fan of this one because i felt like the miso flavoring was not strong enough for me. but the egg was amazing. i would definitely add this to my ramen.sapporo bottled was hoping for draft ~ service amazing service with smiles everywhere ! wait on wednesday for a table of at pm was minutes.ambiance casual with dim lighting. small place with a ramen bar and about side tables for slightly larger parties not good for tables of + ."
736,Annie L.,1115,3,4/30/18,"came here a few months back during my nyc trip. arrived on a thursday night around pm and there was a line out the door already. put our names on the waiting list and about mins or so we got seated inside. after all the hype i decided to try it out and it was aok. i think i'm spoiled by all the good ramen places out here in the bay area that this was just ok.i ordered the miso paitan which included ground pork, half boiled egg, scallions, bean sprouts, onions and char siu. i paid extra to add some tofu. broth was steaming hot which was perfect for cold weather. noodles were plentiful but it stops there. there was no wow factor just a quick bowl of ramen that got lost in the shuffle of all the other hundreds of bowls of ramen that i have had. also ordered fried oysters and a plate of curry rice over chicken. both items were ok.service was quick as this is a quick in and out type of place. asked for a coke which never came. super busy so hard to have severs that are attentive. this is also cash only, a little inconvenient but there is an atm right next door. unfortunately will not be back."
737,Vishal P.,1115,4,7/27/18,"pretty much my go to ramen spot when i'm in the area.i love their steamed pork buns. what i love about their ramen is that their soup base is very flavorful. i always get something spicy. any ramen bowl can be made extra spicy! top it off with a boiled egg, bamboo shoots and scallions! so good!"
738,Qme Z.,1115,5,3/23/18,"i came here with my boyfriend a little before they opened for dinner around . there was already a group of about people waiting in front of us. we put our name down on the list and then was given a menu to place our orders before they seated us. we were seated at which is when they open, and had already placed our orders at the stand in the front.we ordered the mega ramen and the spicy ramen. both with creamy and savory broths. i wish the ramen was more al dente, but still delicious. good size chashu with the ramen unlike other places. i was definitely full off the one bowl of ramen. i also ordered the pork baos but found them to be underwhelming, next time i will stick with the ramen only."
739,Megan T.,1115,4,10/21/18,"this is my favorite place to get ramen. it is so delicious i cannot even. be ready to wait outside for about minutes though because it is busy every hour of the day and every day of the week. they have a good system where you order outside before you get in so the tables open up quick, but they also expect you to leave right after you are finished eating. do not go here planning to have a slow meal. very delicious i just wish they would open a larger seating area so the dining experience could be more enjoyable!"
740,Edwin P.,1115,5,2/19/18,"when my girlfriend and i were planning our weekend getaway to nyc, this was one of the places we knew we had to hit up, so we planned that after going to broadway, we would come here for dinner and we did.located on a side street in midtown hell's kitchen , we came here after seeing anastasia. this a nofrills place but even at pm the line was out the door. the concept is pretty simple. you write your name down on a paper outside the door and how many in your party and you grab a menu. promptly the hostess will come and take your order while you wait for your seat. after a minute wait we were seated and not even minutes from when we were seated, we were served our ramen bowls. we both ordered the spicy paitan with chicken. the ramen was served in a ridiculously large and deep bowl, and being outside in degree weather with rain, this was such a comfort food that we gladly slurped it and finished it.as stated before, this a no frills place, so you order, eat and pay. this is not the place you want to stay too long, due to the long lines and the size of the restaurant, but if you do get the chance, try it.oh and also, cash only."
741,Sadie A.,1115,5,11/4/18,"i went here while visiting new york, and i was very pleased with everything. i got the chicken ramen and it was amazing."
742,Crystal M.,1115,5,8/9/18,the first time i tried to come here there was a long line outside and i said no thanks. but then i decided to come on a thursday for dinner and although very small. the ramen was amazing. i got the extra spicy chicken taipan. and it was great. the extra spicy sauce on the side was the perfect touch. i will definitely be back again!
743,Marilu F.,1115,5,2/16/18,"we booked a trip to nyc and wanted to know what the hot spots were. i happened to find totto ramen as i was looking for a place to eat after watching anastasia on broadway. given that it kept popping up on many lists, i had friends who had visited it on yelp, and that it was close by, affordable, and something that there is not a lot of in miami, we went for it.totto ramen is underground. you essentially go in the entrance, go downstairs, and sign your name. waiting is outside unless it is not packed and you have a little area by the stand that you can wait. when you write your name, make sure to include however many people are in your party and make sure everyone is present. they will not sit you if you have people in your party missing.anyway, take a look at the menu and get ready to order. the hostess takes your order while you wait. once you finally get let inside, you are led to a table or to the bar area where you see the employees cooking, pulling noodles by hand and the like. it is pretty interesting and the employees there are super nice. they answer questions about the process, and in general, just want you to enjoy your food. that is another thing, too, the food is almost immediately placed on the table once you are finally sat. this is a no frills, let us eat, pay, and get out of here restaurant.the place is ridiculously small. you really want to enjoy your meal without rushing. still, do not overstay your welcome. other guests want a shot at the ramen, too, and let me tell you it is worth it. we waited minutes in raining cold and i was so happy when i finally had my spicy paitan with chicken. note that the boyfriend got the same and we ate happily, our bellies full. we were probably in the last group of the night as this place closes at midnight and we were there around pm or so.i saw people order a variety of dishes from pork buns to mega bowls, but what really stands out here is the chicken paitan. have it spicy or not spicy, big or small, but have it. you will have no regrets and it definitely hits the spot after a long and arduous day. add the weather being subpar and it is a recipe to get you smiling. be aware that this is not the only location. there are several around town, this one just happened to be the one we went to. oh, and if you speak japanese all the better, even if it is just to say thank you. if the staff was nice before, they are even nicer when you show them you appreciate their hard work.pretty sure, too, this has been covered, but i will say it again. there is one just last thing that you need to know cash only."
744,Serena J.,1115,5,4/4/18,"the mega paitan is the way to go. comes with three varieties of pork so you can try them all! it will put you in a ramen coma. i was a bit apprehensive about trying it because i thought chicken broth would be a bit bland, but i'm glad they used chicken broth because otherwise, i think all that pork would have killed me. the shredded pork, garlic, and other garnishes make this broth extremely heavy in a good way , and i think you could easily split this bowl with someone else.the place itself is a very chic holeinthewall type place. it reminds me of ramen places in japan, but like, american hipsterfied. really cool place to grab dinner. beware of the wait i came early, but there was a bit of a line when i left.there is a place next door that seems to be the same restaurant, but with tonkatsu broth. i might give it a try next time i'm in the area."
745,Melinda H.,1115,5,"8/31/2018
Updated review","oh how i love this place! this is one of our mandatory stops when we come to nyc and i'm sure i put that in each of my previous reviews here, but i'm serious! this place will not let you down! you are missing out if you do not try this! it is perfect!! seriously the best ramen i've ever had and the place that taught me what ramen should taste like. if you need to know what correct ramen is, how it should taste & be served then come here if you cannot make it to japan. the menu is limited, but you can add items to your bowl. you can also get extra noodles if you run out before your broth. also do not forget to sign in when you first get there since there is always a wait. enjoy, i know i do!"
746,Jaime B.,1115,5,"11/2/2018
Updated review",really great!! very small place but ramen is amazing. great flavor. big plates. highly recommended.
747,Aaron R.,1115,5,10/7/18,so good. this place does not mess around. the noodles were firm and fresh. dub step music in the background was the perfect compliment to the meal! highly recommend.
748,Jay G.,1115,3,7/14/18,"i got the most famous ramen they have and the soup was so sick! i did not like at much but it had a lot of meat and ramen was good, the staff are nice so i'm giving it a star"
749,Mimi T.,1115,4,1/18/18,"totto ramen is a small ramen shop. at first glance, it seems that is mostly counter seating, but there are tables in the back. we were seated at a high table. the staff here are really friendly and made sure everything was okay throughout our meal.the ramen seems to be chicken broth, and is quite yummy.+miso paitan this seems to be the chicken paitan soup with a ball of miso in the middle this is great so i could mix in however much i want. i actually really liked the rich broth so i only mixed in about of the miso. the noodles were a nice chewy texture. i also chose to add pork instead of chicken , which was tougher than i prefer my chashu but definitely meatier. the scallions were delicious and added texture.the ramen was tasty, especially for the cold day. my friends also really enjoyed their drinks! just keep in mind that this is a cashonly establishment. all in all, a yummy ramen shop!"
750,Vy T.,1115,5,1/13/18,"wow, just wow! we were deciding between this place or the other popular ramen place down the block and are pretty happy with our decision!!! great smiley service and real japanese people cooking d!tip the best tip i can give you is to write your name down, ask how long the first person in line has been waiting and then do something else buy gloves maybe for the suggested wait time xd. it did not even feel like we had to wait for mins!!!! two different kind of noodles, make sure you ask foe the one you want. there is that yellow egg noodle my preference and the white buck like flour noodle. i did not ask and got the latter."
751,Sam L.,1115,5,3/13/18,"been here many times and to other ramen shops in the area, and i think this is one of my favorites. if you come during peak hours, you could wait for about minutes but their service is fairly quick.during a busy time, you need to walk up to the front and put your name down. when it is almost your turn to be seated, they will come to you with their menu so they can take your order before you are seated. once you are seated, the ramen comes out in just a few minutes.i have ordered multiple items on their menu, but i think their spicy paitan is my favorite. the extra spicy paitan is not that much spicier and i like the flavor of the spicy sauce compared to the extra spicy sauce. the ramen comes with a lot of green onions. if you do not like green onion, make sure to ask for none. if i remember correctly, the miso ramen just comes with a dollop of miso paste on top and you need to mix it in.the broth is really nice. it has the perfect consistencyit is not too thick where it is super heavy and it is not too thin to where the broth does not hang onto the noodles. i would describe the broth as peppery. the noodles are also nice and chewy!if you are lucky or not , you will be seated at the bar and you can watch them make each bowl of ramen if you are into that. you can see them use the torch to char the meat right before serving it, cook the noodles and add all the toppings. they have it down to a science.reading multiple reviews, i have seen many negative ones where their staff demanded more tip than what was given, which has yet to happen to me since i usually give the typical amount of tip. just keep this in mind when coming."
752,Richard H.,1115,1,8/26/18,"i would avoid this establishment if possible. i'm surprised at the high review. food sucks and service blows.the most popular ramen is expensive costing for a bowl. broth is thick, super oil heavy, and on the very salty side. prepare to drink cups of water from this salt soup and have on speed dial for the possibility of a heart attack after your meal.the saddest part of their place is their service. these servers are rude. they just do not give a f ck about you. they know they will get customers because of their high reviews so they go in with this entitled mentality. they provide no service beside bringing out your meal. you need to constantly flag the waiter to refill your water. with such sh tty service, they expect a % tip. worse of all, they will stop you, haggle you, and embarrass you for leaving a tip not worthy of what they think they should get. and for the record, we kindly left a % tip to be nice when we should of left them with nothing. and they still had the nerve to stop you and tell you that the tip was not enough. what kind of restaurant does that it is so sad the owner approves of their behavior and reading from other people's reviews, it seems like this behavior has been going on for awhile."
753,Tiffany K.,1115,3,9/19/18,i love ramen and i've had amazing ramen from the freezer aisle from sun ramen. and i think that was better than totto. it could have been that it was hot and humid outside and totto does not offer great air conditioning but i found the ramen just ok. luckily we did not have to wait to be seated which was nice!
754,Brandon P.,1115,5,3/11/18,"so when the wife and i came there today on sunday we were met with a huge wait line, and there was a place right next door that was the same thing but pork broth which is the same people. but in japan i agree it is pork that is the original. but, i just had to try the chicken broth to see what everyone else was eating. so it came time for us to order, we had the number and number wow great taste from that broth and nice spice from the green onion and the nice flavor on that pork!sweet mother of jesus those bowls were pretty spicy even without that extra spicy oil.we loved every bite. thank you so much!!!"
755,Anjeline R.,1115,4,9/3/18,we usually go to the other totto ramen location in hell's kitchen but this was closer to our hotel. it was hella busy right as it opened but they seated us fairly quickly. it is efficient that they take your order beforehand so it is ready when you get seated. everything was great but i think the hell's kitchen location is better. not sure why but the flavors there were better. still it was absolutely yummy and glad i went!
756,Hui L.,1115,3,6/7/18,"i did not know i could love chicken paitan i consider myself a tonkotsu ramen fan but totto's make have convinced me otherwise.came here for an early dinner as it is going to be my last week working in this area and did not have to wait long for a seat by the kitchen. yeah the stools have no backs and there are also no hooks for bags or anything so i just held my bag. it was cool watching the chefs at work while they put together the ramen bowls and stir the hot giant pots of soup bases. they do add some kind of special sauce or oil from a brown jar before adding in the rest of the components of the dish. maybe it adds flavor i went with the classic chicken paitan with chicken instead of pork which i later regretted . they also offered this dish with miso but i wanted to taste the chicken soup on it is own with any influences from other umami flavors. i'm totally fine with few toppings.my bowl came out in about minutes. the chicken had the consistency of slightly softer chicken breast meat. definitely should have gotten the pork char siu instead. the noodles were soft. i did not really get or care for the raw onions on top and chopped scallions. the soup is definitely the star of the bowl. i did not know chicken broth could taste so good! it is almost almost on par with the richness of tonkotsu broth! towards the bottom of the bowl though, it gets a bit grainy. as in tiny pieces of shredded chicken have sunk to the bottom and the last bit of soup you want to drink has the texture of drinking some poorly mixed powdered drink.so verdict tried it. but tonkotsu broth still wins."
757,Tommaso M.,1115,4,1/7/18,"delicious. delicious. delicious.they have locations, one next to the other. the first one serves ramen with chicken broth, and the other serves pork broth. i decided to go with th to pork one.i tried their mega charsiu tonkotsu ramen and i am still drooling at the thought of that huge bowl of magic. the texture of their noodles is perfect. the broth is very tasty but not too salty meaning you can actually finish it! . the fried garlic is among the best i have ever tried. and the pork is so soft and juicy that the only comment is oh my. !the only complaint is the loud music and the fact that since there is always people waiting, you are served quickly and they try to make you go away as soon as you are finishing your meal. other than that which is understandable, given the size of the place , a highly recommended ramen spot in manhattan!"
758,June C.,1115,5,6/30/18,"it is my second time tried toto ramen. the first time i tried at the second store located at st street, which is bigger store and have tables inside. because there was a long line at the original toto ramen store located at nd street. this time i tried at the original store and i came here at am and got a seat at the bar very soon. there are only a bar at the original ramen store and that is why it is always a line. i ordered their most popular mega ramen this time. it surprised me there are so many kinda of meat inside. definitely it worths . but also i think there are too many meats in one ramen and the soup becomes not so pure and smooth. last time i ordered the original one , the soup was quite good and rich. it depends on what you want. the waiter and waitress at the original store are both very sincerely. both are awesome experience."

Updated review","had the mega paitan ramen and the original. probably best thing i've eaten all year it is february but whatever broth is very thick and there is a depth of flavor i've not had before in ramen. its reminiscent of a chicken noodle soup. i enjoyed the fresh onions and scallions in the soup it helped cut through the rich and salty broth. if you get the original, i encourage you to order an egg it is worth the two bucks. excited to come back and try their other ramen options.service is quick. there are limited seats and lots of people to accommodate so there is a very efficient turn over of customers."
760,Megan W.,1115,4,1/11/18,"although the prices seem relatively high ~ for a smaller sized bowl of ramen, the broth is very thick and filling. i ordered the extra spicy paitan with pork, but got the spice on the side. the dish was very fragrant and flavorful, but i would recommend getting the spice on the side because it can be very spicy. next time, i would request a smaller amount of green onions next time, since the amount was overwhelming.the char siu pork bun was extremely juicy and soft, and the flavor was very sweet. i would refrain from this dish if you are not a fan of oily greasy foods. i personally thought that the amount of mayonnaise was slightly overwhelming. at the price of . for and . for , i do not see myself ordering this often.as a small ramen shop, totto ramen is relatively busy, even right before close. however, the workers are very friendly and do their best to accommodate your party in a timely manner. my party of four was given a thirty minute wait time, but we were seated and served within the next fifteen minutes!"
761,Steph Y.,1115,4,12/19/17,"damn the line here is always long, i have yet to see no line here but it is worth the wait i have only come around lunch time, so it may be worse during dinner time . typically my party size is not so large either so that definitely helps. plus, you can pretty much know what you are going to order even before you go in since there are menus for everyone to look at outside.i must say, they are pretty efficient and getting customers in and out while providing good service. the staff members are always checking up on customers to see if they enjoyed their food.totto is good, but not as good as i remembered. but to be honest, i do not know if it is because i've eaten so much ramen in my life now that my standards have gone up. i also ordered a different dish last time chicken paitan which was much smaller and lighter than their best seller, the mega paitan! that is what i ordered this time, it was really good but i'm just at that point of my life where i probably should not be eating that much because ramen is extremely filling, lots of fats & carbs but i did eat the whole thing and was in a food coma shortly but i know better next time to order a smaller bowl.i will always come back here as the service is great, prices are reasonable and definitely on a cold day "
762,Rebecca L.,1115,3,6/25/18,"i've been here a couple of times and originally i would give it starts, but since my last visit, i would say i've downgraded it to stars.if you stick with the pork ramen, it is pretty decent, but i made the mistake of ordering chicken on my last visit i figured the brand had a rooster, so they must be known more for chicken . never again. chicken was really dry. not sure if it was just a bad bowl, but i'm going to stick with pork from now on."
763,Amber K.,1115,5,2/6/18,"i usually have pork based broth's when i get ramen so i was a little skeptical about totto ramen when i learned it was all chicken based. i thought it usually did not carry as much flavor, but boy was i wrong.i guess my first clue to how good it was should have been the line to get in at around pm on a sunday night. my group had to put our name down on a master list and wait outside, but i will say they were very efficient in terms of getting people in and out fast. they take your order even before you get seated so they know what to bring you as soon as you sit down.i got the pork buns to start, which were super cheap for and tasted amazing. honestly probably some of the best i've had in terms of flavor, size, and juiciness. i got the chicken paitan for my ramen bowl which was chicken broth with pork meat as a topping and a soft boiled egg to add. the broth was very rich, fatty and almost buttery, which i love when it comes to ramen. the other toppings were pretty typical and nothing too special, so the broth is what really stole the show.overall i loved totto ramen and definitely will come again, just maybe not at such a crowded time. the prices were so cheap for such a popular place. just wish there was more seating since i ended up sitting on a small stool that stuck out into the aisle a bit, but that is okay when you are eating great food!"
764,Leslie T.,1115,4,5/29/18,"people have been raving about totto ramen forever and it was good, but honestly nothing too special. i realize that most people order the chicken paitan and i opted for classic tonkotsu. maybe that is why i was only satisfied and not impressed but i was happy about the price, especially it was just as if not slightly less yummy compared to ippudo and other ramen places in the area. definitely better than mentoku where people go if totto's wait is too long haha . after tax and tip it came out to and i left full and satisfied. came at pm on the saturday of memorial day weekend and there was no wait last time i had wanted to go was dinner on the saturday of labor day and the wait was . hours. so got to try your luck "
765,Kim J.,1115,1,10/24/18,"what kind of establishment has workers who follow you outside demanding a tip, as if the service deserved a tip! they are out of their fucking minds and lucky i did not get out of character and slap the shit out of him. disgusting, no words, tip is not an obligation, and i grabbed my wallet to leave a tip but then i thought, wait why would he have to say it so arrogantly . so i said forget this, there was nothing good about this service and this disgusting disgrace for human life decides it is appropriate to follow me outside of the restaurant demanding i tip. look, the ramen was mediocre, the service was equivalent to mc donalds. save your time & money! no wonder their competitors next door are thriving!!"

Updated review",staff is terrible. remember that you are an employee. customers keep your doors open. you are no longer the only ramen shop in town.a disgrace to the people of japan. a slap in the face to the people of new york city.and all your other locations have lost the quality in their broth. pffft!bakayaro!!
767,Blue B.,1115,1,9/7/18,"this was a few months ago. the food was good but i hate the customer service there. me and my friend went to celebrate birthday but there was an waiter ruined our happiness. he missed our order caused my friend to wait another mins because they just started to cook. this waiter showed discriminatory attitude toward asian guests and his name is naroto. when we talked to him said you missed the order. he said we did not order it. he blamed us for his mistake. come on man, bring your brain to work. we ordered a combo paitan ramen and salmon roll and an extra spicy ramen, but you only served salmon roll and extra spicy ramen. do not you ever think about the meaning of combo the worst thing was no explanation, no excuse and no apologize. he even shook his hand to us in the back and thought we did not see it.i love the food there but will not go anymore."
768,Stone Y.,1115,1,8/27/18,"i've been to so many ramen restaurants. this is pretty average ramen place. if consider the pricing, environment and service, it is under average. do not understand it goes viral and popular. broth wise, it is way too salty, which is not drinkable, what so ever. the environment is a joke. ac was installed way back in the place. you would have to sweat a lot while you eat, which is not enjoyable. would not recommend if you have high expectation on both quality and quantity. overall it is way overpriced. feel sorry for new yorkers. they have to spend so much time in queue to eat mediocre bowl of ramen. never ever put it in your bucket list if you are traveling, not worth wasting time at all."
769,Mickey H.,1115,1,8/26/18,"absolutely rude cashier! i will explain at the end.if you desire clogged up arteries, then this is your spot! just had dinner and ordered bowls of ramen of their best seller and of their miso based bowl. not only was the broth for all bowls beyond super oily, thick and high in sodiumx , i had to constantly ask for water refills to help dilute my palette. it would have been nice if the servers were acute to their surroundings to not constantly flag them for refills for their salty af meal! terrible service and even terrible employees.so let me begin by explaining my headliner why my experience here was beyond subpar. let us start off with educating the owner and the male cashier of this place that tip is discretionary based on your experience. there is no mandatory or minimum required percentage by law, it is only a suggested percentage. i was actually stopped by the cashier after payment because they did not get their % desired tip that they were looking for. well, look here buddy, i can pay what i want to pay. how dare you come at me and tell me there is a mandatory percentage and lie to my face like that to scam me like i was a foreigner not knowing that system screw your business and f k the male cashier. too bad i did not get your name to blast you for your unethical behavior. consider the additonal i gave you as a charity donation to your high cholesterol establishment. perhaps you can use that money to educate yourself the definition of tip. conclusion stay away from this place. disgusting noodles and even more vomiting of a business with shady ass workers.again, rarely do i give out a star rating but this place deserves stars. too bad that is the min i have to give to post for a review. you are lucky you even get a star to begin with."
770,Vu T.,1115,1,8/23/18,"if i could give this place zero stars i would. one of the items we ordered was pork buns, the pork was so dry and overcooked that it was impossible to even chew. we were disappointed but we figured okay let us just go to a different spot after we finish. i was not even going to write this review until our waiter was completely rude. before i could even finish signing my name on the bill, he told us i need you to leave we have other customers waiting. never coming back."
771,Owais K.,1115,1,8/20/18,"the main reason this is a star is because of customer experience. will not repeat or recommend to family and friends.food decent, noodles were soft and the chicken was cooked to the right temperature. broth would need some improvement. but it is not something that i will want to try again.customer service worst, rude waitress. illogical store policy simply trying to loot tourists.pros do not have to wait long for the food to come out.decent food portion.cons cash only businesssmall seating arrangements.stupid store policy. order per customer even if the customer is a year old baby.detail i took a weekend trip to nyc with my wife and year old. around pm we were craving some ramen and i found this place over yelp. looked pretty good with stars and over reviews. the place was very small but all tables and counter tops was taken and the business was running good. had to wait mins before we got a table.we got seated and were handed the menu, when the waitress came over to take the order she said that 'as per store policy i need to order minimum dishes since we are people'. wait a minute are you counting a year old baby as an adult well i ended up wasting around on something which was left untouched while he sat there watching cartoons on the phone. i ordered the mega paitan while my wife ordered spicy paitan and if you are wondering what i got for my son it was an avocado bun . while taking the order the waitress let us know that they do not accept cards its cash only and the bill would be around . let us stop and check the calendar to see which year we are in, last i saw it was . i asked my wife and she said she has around with her i never carry any cash its only my debit card and drivers license .we finished our food and it was time to pay the bill. so i asked my wife to give me the money and to our surprise when she looked inside her purse she only had . i felt bad that i did not have enough money to tip the waitress so i called her over and said that i do have the money to pay the bill but not enough to tip her and if there was any other way to swipe my card. to my shock this was her response you knew how much the bill was before eating . i do not think i have to explain what she meant here."
772,Jimmy C.,1115,1,8/3/18,"worst experience ever, waiter ask you to sign your name all by yourself, on a piece of paper nobody is watching, really i only come because i thought this is a typical overrated ramen house for white people so at least the service will be okay, but well, you cannot even relay on that."
773,Franky P.,1115,1,8/1/18,"unpleasant experience here starting from the food, quality of customer service, and the sanitation. the ramen noodles ordered had the kind of odor and taste that you do not get from clean ramen broths st other japanese ramen restaurants. i could not eat it. also the temperature here is maintained at degrees so be prepared to sweat and feel uncomfortable during your whole time here in the summer heat. the waitress was not attentive and was flirting with other employees here. not helpful. not recommended."
774,Olivia P.,1115,1,7/31/18,"this is a scam. it is a giant tourist trap. the staff are actually nasty and extremely rude. they yell at you if you do not leave enough tip! the food is beyond mediocre. it is one big, joke, and the joke is on you if you pay money here.i hope it closes down as soon as possible."
775,Eeewwe D.,1115,1,6/27/18,"i was instructed to sign my name at the front clipboard, however, it seemed like the main usher did not even care to look at the board and when the customers that came after us pointed out that we were here before them, the usher just gave himself a shrug, did not apologize and just replaced us with the group that was kind enough to point out the mistake. after we sat down the food came in less than minutes. broth was thick and rich, however, the noodles were undercooked. it might have been the noodles or something else, but i ended up with a severe case of digestive issues within minutes. i know that this place is popular and busy, but i was kind of embarrassed spending dollars eating a bowl of ramen with my wife receiving below average quality food and service. i have heard lots of good things about this place and i hope this does not happen to anyone else that visits this shop."

777,Hong L.,1115,1,6/18/18,"it is very bad experience for this popular ramen though the food is not bad. first at all, when we outside and the guy came and told they only accept cash. not very bad for this but still not good for customers who like to use digital money like us. secondly, and this is the most important issue for here, we are party of four and are kids with age and . when we ordered and we planned to order ramen and appetizers and the guy told and pointing to the menu we must to order ramen per customer that of course including all the kids. fair ! never heard this. because of this and we have to order ramen only without the appetizers since we have no way to finish all with kids. and the guy looks very unhappy since we only order ramen. finally, when we paid and dropped of the tips and the lady came to the table and checked how many we left for the tips though we are still sitting. the funny thing is the lady asked us for why we rips under %, just shorter because we are not very happy with the guy force us to order ramen. after we questioned her back is this required the tips must be %+ and the answer is whatever the customers like to do. all these made us have a very bad experience with this location. i know my review will be nothing here inside the k plus reviews but just want to tell what i think and this is my first review in yelp."
778,Lucy Y.,1115,1,6/9/18,"ramen was ok, but their horrible service made me speechless.first, i ordered the extra spicy miso paitan and thought it might be too spicy for me. so i asked for a small plate politely and took some spices and a little portion of the scallions out onto the plate. this waitress stood next to me and meanly angrily accused me that if i did not want scallions, i should have told them earlier. she even said it twice loudly. so rude. i was embarrassed but shook because i like to eat scallions but they put too much in my bowl covering the noodles and broth so i wanted to take some out. plus i just did not want my ramen to be too spicy so i had to took some spices out too is that something unreasonable to do that you had to act like that it is entirely my freedom to do whatever i want with my ramen, no anyway, i did not say anything to her and kept on eating.meanwhile, since my bf and i were seated under the ac, i was facing the wind and cold air for the whole time. it got way too cold, and my chest felt really uncomfortable so i asked another waitress to adjust the ac she did it happily friendlily and i appreciate that!the ramen i ordered was mediocre did not like the flavor so you know, i was not really satisfied with my overall experience.when it comes to the check, i did not want to give % bc of the first waitress's attitude and put % down. she, the same lady^, counted the cash in front of us and threw it back, be like tips are not included & you gave too little in a horrific attitude. me and my bf were shook honestly, if your service was good enough i would have gave you % or more. and i have the rights to give how much i want depending on the service not mandatory or at a fixed rate. now she has the decency to demand for more tips very unprofessional. she got so angry after i explained why i would not give more, took the money and stormed out.this lady makes me not want to go back to totto ramen ever again in my entire life. and i will not lol."
779,Yipeng D.,1115,1,6/6/18,"the server let us waited for a table for for minutes, and then told us we can only sit at the bar. when we request a formal table he refused with no reasons. terrible service, would never come again!"
780,Daniel N.,1115,1,6/4/18,"this is my first time in new york and i was looking for something to eat near times square that had good ratings. i happened to stumble upon totto and was intrigued by how high the rating was and decided to come for dinner. however, i had the miso ramen for and a side of spice, which was for something so small and that caught me by surprise. the quality of the broth was okay and seemed to be really rich making it thicker than most broths. the spice was not spicy at all so i recommend not wasting your money on the extra spice and just go for the extra spicy if you want spicy. unfortunately, the reason why i'm giving this one star rating is because of the tipping system. i was not given the proper amount of service by the server and she had the audacity to force me to tip more than i should have. she personally stopped us and asked for more, even stopping my friend from leaving without tipping. i am really disappointed in this restaurant because of their actions."
781,Debbie d.,1115,1,5/30/18,"this place, compared to ippudo, is average. the buns ea are good, the ramen is not. ordered their chicken paitan , tasted average. the mega paitan at tasted average too. every small addition to the ramen, like half egg and spices are extra . went here a week ago, no a c, crazy hot inside. and they really rush you to get out. do not forget your cash, and tip %, the japanese servers are so onpoint with their math that they confront you on the spot if you are missing a few cents to make the % mark which is not deserved given the sweaty ambience and rushed service ."
782,A M.,1115,1,5/26/18,"this onestar review is in reference to the customer service. i went with a friend a while ago and the host waiter stopped us for an extra tip. this establishment asks you to order in advance so you are in and out to avoid waiting times for other patronshence, limited patron waiter interaction. i thought it was petty since this place is highly popular and would not have problems getting business and tips. if you want to try the ramen, i would suggest go ahead. if you are expecting good customer service, then i would have a hard time recommending this place."
783,Ang F.,1115,1,5/18/18,"for ramen, i give it a star. for the waitress that provided no service yet demanded for more tips, to the extend of using calculator and told us that people usually give % when we have given % is way rude. we would have tip more. but the waitress simply turns me off."
784,CJ R.,1115,1,1/27/18,"i was about to rate this place stars, but what happened the last minute as i was about to leave made me so furious that this place does not deserve my star.ramen was good, do not get me wrong, but i had better. for me, the music was playing way too loud that i could not carry a normal conversation. the water that they served us had some traces of lint.i tipped the amount that takes into consideration of the food, service, and cleanliness. as i was about to leave, one of the waitresses tapped me on the shoulder, pulled me to the side, and informed me that i tipped too little and demanded i tipped the %. i told her that tips are optional, not mandatory. she did not stop after that and urged me pay the remaining percentage. she basically this establishment is so unprofessional and inconsiderate. if you want the gratuity to be mandatory, then enforce it and apply it to the receipt.take note if you come here, make sure you have enough money to pay % for tips. if not, prepare to get harassed. you do not believe me on the search within the reviews section, type 'tips' and you will see hundreds of bad experiences from other yelpers who ate at this disgraceful restaurant."
785,Jorge C.,1115,1,1/24/18,"where do i start. i've been hearing about this place for over a year and finally, i decided to give it a shot. i came in here with an empty stomach and was ready to feast. first i ordered pork buns and when i took a bite of it, it felt as if i bit into a baconator from wendy's. the amount of fat and oil that dripped looked like an oil shipwreck. then i ordered the chicken ramen and was beyond disappointed. my first impression of my chicken ramen was eh, but i endured on. not giving up on the ramen i gave it chance after chance believing it will get better however, it never did. i would not give this to my dog because she goes to ippudo or ramen ya."

787,Glenda S.,1115,1,1/13/18,my friends and i came here. there were three of us in total and we had to wait about minutes for a table for all of us to eat at. everything was good until we saw a small roach crawl across the table. my friends could not eat after seeing that and it ruined my mood. we did not want to waste our money so we asked for a discount and we did not get one.as i looked at the other reviews it looks like this was a problem since .will not be back here.
788,Jeff E.,1115,1,1/2/18,"be very mindful of how much cash you leave with the waiter. read on. i live in the neighborhood and have had good bowls of ramen here for years. service is becoming increasingly unbearable and far too aggressive. as many other reviewers have mentioned, the service staff is very aggressive when it comes to tips mind you, this place rushes you through your meal and out the door while expecting a minimum % tip . now there is a new trick to get even more out of customers. today, i had a meal and left in cash with the waiter. i very clearly remember that i had only s and one in my wallet. the waiter came back with change as if i would left . i politely told him that i would left him . he raised his voice slightly and said no. you gave me . he ran to his computer, came back, and insisted that i left him . again, looking him straight in the eyes i said, politely but sternly, i left you . he then proceeded to provide the correct change. it goes without saying, but i left very disappointed by this experience. it is not about the money. who cares, it is five bucks, which i left as a tip anyways. it is the dishonesty and the shenanigans they pull off to get more out of their customers. totto's reputation is forever damaged in my eyes. my sense is that the workers here are potentially severely underpaid and need to resort to desperate and dishonest means to pay their bills. if that is true, i'm very sorry they are in that position. i can empathize with that. i cannot empathize with dishonesty as a solution."
789,Junyuan C.,1115,1,12/26/17,"the waiter will never let you leave even if you have already paid . % for lunch tips cash only and i really did not have an extra cent . if you want to be insulted, welcome to totto ramen!!!"
790,David W.,1115,1,12/23/17,"we were here to celebrate a friends birthday. they placed our order before we sat as we waited in line. we were seated for only minutes when we finished our food and planned to eat cake. they said it would take too long, despite the fact that other customers were eating for way longer. the workers were extremely rude."
