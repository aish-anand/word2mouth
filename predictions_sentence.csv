13,1118,[],not recommended to walkin without reservation
13,1118,[],
14,1118,[],visited the dosa with family as it came with a glowing recommendation and a rating on yelp
14,1118,[],"but boy, were we in for a rude shock! landing at the place with a prior reservation, we were welcomed by a big heavy door and a sizeable eating joint designed at two levels"
14,1118,[],little did i realise that it was the only big thing that we were going to be experiencing in the restaurant that night besides the final cheque of course which was already expected we immediately realised after talking to the hostess that they had forgotten to reserve a table for us yelp
14,1118,[],"they tried to turn it around with a tiny corner table on the upper level which could have seated kids maybe! after a few minutes of contemplation, maybe the staff realised we were definitely not going to sit in each other's laps and the guests on the adjacent table sportingly moved to make more space for us"
14,1118,[],"the real horror started then with our server for the day, brittany c"
14,1118,[],"now when a restaurant decides to charge you a % service markup automatically just because you are group of or more, the least that you expect is a decent service! but brittany came in with a tiny heart and grumpy attitude and seemed more in a mood as if we were there to eat for free! after a very offending introduction to a set menu or the preferable ala carte menu , we placed our orders without any recommendations being offered by her despite telling that it was our first visit"
14,1118,"[('rava', 15, 19), ('egg', 26, 29)]","we ordered the rava dosa, egg dosa, chile uttapam and goat biryani along with a rasam the complimentary pappadums never came out even though the meal came pretty quickly"
14,1118,[],we had to explicitly ask for them before they turned up
14,1118,[],now the dosa and uttapam were served with a moderate sized bowl of sambhar and tiny portions of chutneys
14,1118,[],"anyway knowing anything about south indian food may please enlighten me how to eat a dosa with a few spoons of sambhar and a teas oonful of chutney the food was served very rudely and when we asked if we could get more chutney, we got a condescending answer of it will cost you"
14,1118,[],"when we have our consent another server brought it out and it was shockingly just another teaspoonful! we asked the new server if this is what we get in , he got confused and said he will be right back after checking but it never happened! now in this entire episode the food is not anything great to write about"
14,1118,[],it is not bad but it is definitely not worth a for someone who knows how south indian tastes like
14,1118,[],"the goat biryani is definitely not a recommendation at all!! coming back to the service, we never got any water refills and noone checked on how we were liking the food"
14,1118,[],at the end of it we left most of the goat biryani but brittany just brought out the cheque and did not even care to ask why the biryani was left over
14,1118,[],"for the biryani we asked for a take away box thought we could give it to someone needy but brittany just brought the box and placed it rudely in front of us without a word or smile after all this, we decided that the service did not deserve a % charge and we called in the manager who came in with a fake smile and concern"
14,1118,"[('desserts', 84, 92)]",the manager heard our entire ordeal and said she will fix the bill and offered free desserts
14,1118,[],we told her very clearly we did not want free stuff but also did not want to pay for a service we did not get and just wanted the charge removed
14,1118,"[('desserts', 71, 79)]",but she insisted that as it was mother's day she would want us to have desserts so we agreed
14,1118,[],"and then she crumpled the old bill right in front of us, do not know if that was really required to be done! in comes brittany with the dessert oh the horror!!"
14,1118,"[('head', 78, 82)]","she placed one dessert in front of us rudely she could have dropped it on our head if she could have had her way and made a statement you talked to my manager, your bill will come in soon and just walked away"

14,1118,"[('coffee', 123, 129)]",hello why the hell do people think that customers complain to get free stuff oh and she did come in again to offer chai or coffee which she said was on her
14,1118,[],"well dear brittany, after the experience i would not even had water if it was on you coming from india, i always thought america offers a different standard of service to customers"
14,1118,[],"but dear dosa management, believe me i realise now that tiny hearts and money minded businesses are incapable of offering anything more than a product"
14,1118,[],"please keep your free stuff to yourself, if you can offer anything do offer some warmth in your cold little place! to mr anjan thanks for your revert but it just reaffirms your attitude towards the whole incident! we are not looking for your free stuff so please keep the offer to yourself"
14,1118,[],would have been happier to see your revert say we would offer impeccable and warm service!
15,1118,[],my boyfriend and i think this place was alright
15,1118,[],it is more like an indian fusion restaurant than an authentic southern indian place
15,1118,[],"if we ever crave for dosa again, we probably will go somewhere else"
15,1118,[],"on the day of our visit, the majority of the dishes offered on the menu were vegetarian"
15,1118,[],"though the restaurant was not full, we waited for a long time before the staff came to take our order"
15,1118,[],"for the dosa, we ordered the classic masala dosa"
15,1118,[],there were three complementary sauces and they were all pretty decent
15,1118,[],they were more on the sour side
15,1118,[],the dosa came really fast and the crepe itself was thin and crisp
15,1118,[],pretty good
15,1118,"[('mushroom', 22, 30)]",we also ordered mixed mushroom uttapam
15,1118,[],this dish was really meh
15,1118,[],it felt like a simple pizza on an indian dough
15,1118,"[('cheese', 52, 58)]",uttapam was kinda sour and there was quite a lot of cheese on the dish
15,1118,"[('sauces', 18, 24)]",the complementary sauces were the same as the dosa's
15,1118,[],the dish was fairly bland and also soggy
15,1118,[],we could not manage to finish this
15,1118,[],our last dish was the goat dum biryani
15,1118,[],this was probably our favorite dish out of the three we ordered
15,1118,"[('naanbread', 38, 47)]",the goat biryani was sitting inside a naanbread like bowl and there was a yogurtlike complementary sauce
15,1118,[],the biryani was well flavored and decently spicy
15,1118,[],"we really loved the goat super juicy, soft and wellseasoned"
15,1118,[],"it is a decent indian restaurant but with how much it is charging you, i probably will not revisit again"
15,1118,[],
16,1118,[],the masala dosa was tasty however there was a very small portion of the actual potatoes in the center
16,1118,"[('buck', 78, 82), ('pieces', 93, 99)]","we also ordered the chefs choice uttapam which did not give us a bang for our buck, the five pieces were tiny and basically served as one biters almost"
16,1118,[],if i had to reorder i would go with a regular uttapam rather than a traditional dosa or the chefs choice
16,1118,[],the raita we ordered on the side was as expected but again the portion was rd the serving bowl
16,1118,[],in summary the food was average good but the portions were very small giving the impression of corners being cut
16,1118,[],
17,1118,[],"yums! i really enjoyed the masala dosa dish i ordered, but i think the food here is quite pricey"
17,1118,[],"i've been told by my brown companion that dosa is overpriced and overhyped and to not go here , but i still had to give it a try"
17,1118,"[('potato', 4, 10)]","the potato was quite creamy, and the dosa was light and crispy"
17,1118,[],"i liked the sauces to dip the dosa in it was not super spicy for me, but it can be, especially if you are not used to the heat"
17,1118,"[('dipping soup', 32, 44)]",the sambar lentil and vegetable dipping soup was good as well
17,1118,[],"i tried a bite of my friend's uttapam south indian moons featuring different types of uttapam , and while it was good, it was not utterly amazing"
17,1118,[],"the service here is very friendly, as one would expect for a restaurant of this quality"

18,1118,[],

19,1118,[],"that was the prehype i experienced about dosa, when me and my friend announced our intent to grab a late night dinner there"
19,1118,[],was the guy who said that right about just how good the food was eh
19,1118,[],"it was good, but not something i would look forward to eating day old like him"
19,1118,[],we snuck into the restaurant right before closing
19,1118,[],"still, our waiter was very courteous even though we stayed past official hours"
19,1118,[],"the decor of the restaurant is classy and is definitely a hip, upscale place"
19,1118,[],"for food, i opted to try the south indian moons the chef's selection of five different uttapams"
19,1118,[],"i really appreciate when a restaurant has the option to sample different dishes! they were all pretty good, but i think my main issue was that i could not tell them apart"
19,1118,[],"maybe i should have gotten a dosa after all, that is the name of the restaurant"

1604,1130,[],
1604,1130,[],
1604,1130,[],and it was missing
1604,1130,[],i looked throughout all the reviews
1604,1130,[],
1604,1130,[],
1604,1130,[],"i do not know how they are trying to cover this up, but this seriously needs to be addressed"
1604,1130,[],here it is again
1604,1130,[],"where do i begin? a little background about me is that i have been to several michelin recommended,  star and  star michelin restaurants around the world, some at chef's table experiences, so i was very excited coming to this three star michelin restaurant as i have never been to one with this standing before"
1604,1130,"[('ratings', 63, 70)]",i have read plenty of reviews on this site and saw several low ratings and disregarded them as oddities
1604,1130,[],"however, after being there myself this past week i would have to agree with all the low ratings"
1604,1130,[],"i will sound like an egotistical food snob, but i have to believe that people who gave alinea  stars were dazzled by their presentation and were either tricked into believing what they ate was in fact a delicious meal or had to lie to themselves to justify the price"
1604,1130,[],i will go into my experience at alinea from the beginning
1604,1130,[],first the ambiance
1604,1130,[],everything about alinea screamed a great attention to detail
1604,1130,[],"from the moment of finding their hidden restaurant as i saw no bright sign to indicate it is location to the heavy front door that gave the feeling of exclusivity, to the automatic sliding door in the foyer giving it a contemporary feel, i have to give alinea's presentation a good score"
1604,1130,[],some failures in feel however were the chairs
1604,1130,[],"though the chair was comfortable, it is structure was reclined and the cushion was not firm, but rather let me sink in, making me have to lean back"
1604,1130,[],i found that it was quite uncomfortable while eating
1604,1130,[],"now before everyone think's it is because i am overweight, i am not"
1604,1130,[],i am a  pounds ' male
1604,1130,[],"for a  hour  course meal, this is a very big negative"
1604,1130,[],another failure is the table placement
1604,1130,[],"due to some of the courses having strong scents, it was quite clumsy of their design to seat people so close to each other"
1604,1130,[],i felt that it interfered with my personal experience
1604,1130,[],"again before people start their raving, you must understand that this is a three star michelin restaurant experience"
1604,1130,[],where all aspects of the culinary skills are being appreciated
1604,1130,[],second their service
1604,1130,[],the service at alinea was quite excellent
1604,1130,"[('coats', 55, 60)]","the doorman was prompt, the entry host took my party's coats asked if we would need a cab at the end of the dinner and seated us politely and efficiently"
1604,1130,[],we were greeted at our table and received an explanation of the night and wine pairing choices
1604,1130,[],"throughout the night we received ample attention without being smothered, which is always a fine balance"
1604,1130,[],i would give alinea an excellent rating on service
1604,1130,[],third the food
1604,1130,[],i will break this down to several parts and be brief
1604,1130,[],visual visually alinea's presentation is very good
1604,1130,[],"some of the dishes are plated in a stunning fashion that i feel are there to distract you, but yes i admit that the presentation was very good"
1604,1130,[],smell it was a hit or miss depending on what my neighbors were having
1604,1130,[],"seriously, tables were so close that i was able to converse with them"
1604,1130,[],"taste ok, so this is the most important component in my opinion"
1604,1130,[],everything else is to set the mood for this moment
1604,1130,[],
1604,1130,[],
1604,1130,[],and i feel that alinea fails to meet the standards of a three star michelin restaurant
1604,1130,"[('wine', 21, 25)]",i got the lower cost wine pairing with my meal and some dishes were completely distasteful without drinking the paired drink
1604,1130,[],my second dish that i received was so bitter that i had to drown out that taste with a very sweet wine that was paired with it
1604,1130,[],"now, i might have a strange school of thought, but when i think of a pairing, it is a complement to a dish to make it better, not a subtitute for a poorly tasting dish"
1604,1130,[],this happened throughout the meal where the dish was completely off and i had to drown out the taste with the paired drink
1604,1130,[],"final thoughts having experienced several great michelin restaurants around the world, i was very disappointed with my experience with alinea"
1604,1130,[],"they were creative in their approach to form an experience, but they failed to capture my praise"
1604,1130,[],i would recommend people not waste their money at this establishment as your culinary adventure will leave you disappointed and still hungry at the end
1604,1130,[],"for the cost, they deserve a one star review for not making their food taste delicious regardless of ambiance"
1604,1130,[],"this experience has left me surprised that the standards to receiving a michelin star, and even more so for three stars in the united states is low"
1604,1130,[],"my past favorite restaurants if people can travel i would recommend ciel bleu in amsterdamn, ultraviolet in shanghai, thoumieux in paris"
1604,1130,[],"edit also, i was confused why i did not get my menu in the beginning of my meal and i was very disappointed that it was not signed by the chef"
1604,1130,[],it would take him  minutes to do as his patrons are all paying for tickets in advance
1605,1130,[],"i travel by myself often, but still frequent highend restaurants in the you"
1605,1130,[],s
1605,1130,[],and abroad
1605,1130,[],i have even dined at a guy savoy establishment in paris on new year's eve by myself and been treated with respect and cordiality and it was a great time with superb food
1605,1130,[],"however, i will never be able to know what the food at alinea is like as they do not accommodate single diners"
1605,1130,[],"when i inquired about dining at alinea via email, i was told i had to buy two seats you are actually purchasing a table"
1605,1130,[],
1605,1130,[],
1605,1130,[],i was told
1605,1130,[],i am appalled at this
1605,1130,[],i do not feel anyone should have to pay extra just because they are single or are dining with an odd number of people
1605,1130,[],not even the great joel robuchon at his flagship establishment in las vegas or daniel boulud at daniel in ny or eleven park madison or
1605,1130,[],
1605,1130,[],
1605,1130,[],or
1605,1130,[],
1605,1130,[],
1605,1130,[],or required me to purchase a table
1605,1130,[],shame on alinea!
1606,1130,[],i think alinea and next can stick there e tickets up there butt
1606,1130,[],they charge a mortgage payment for the privilege to eat in hyped up restaurants that are overrated
1606,1130,[],"suggestion to owner, get over yourself"
1606,1130,[],marty
1607,1130,[],i want to preface by saying i really wanted to like alinea
1607,1130,[],"the creativity and service are all  stars, but food was just a big disappointment"
1607,1130,[],"of all the michelin star restaurants i have tried, this is the priciest and my least favorite"
1607,1130,[],"best would probably be  madison since everyone here has already raved about the food, i will just focus on what did not work for me"
1607,1130,[],i came in feb
1607,1130,[],so walking in you go through a little grove of pine trees and emerge to the restaurant
1607,1130,[],simple and chic
1607,1130,"[('chocolate', 56, 65)]",they have you wait a little with an amusestarter of hot chocolate infused with what i can only imagine as the same pine trees that we walked through
1607,1130,[],"my first thoughts were, this is too sweet and i do not particularly like the taste of pine trees with my hot chocolate"
1607,1130,[],"creative, yes"
1607,1130,"[('christmas pine', 37, 51)]","taste, not at all, it reminded me of christmas pine scented candles"
1607,1130,[],i pushed that out of my mind as i figured the rest of the meal would be fabulous
1607,1130,[],"the time we came, the menu seemed to have a lot of asian influence"
1607,1130,[],one set of the courses was a beautiful tower of water with flowers and ice
1607,1130,"[('sashimi fish skewered', 39, 60), ('lemon', 64, 69), ('scallop', 98, 105)]",they then served a couple of pieces of sashimi fish skewered on lemon grass and two slices of raw scallop
1607,1130,[],you are to dip in the hot broth that is accompanied with it and there was also a hot stone that you can cook on
1607,1130,[],"very interactive and fun, but taste wise i was underwhelmed"
1607,1130,[],"i have had scallops in many forms, this was two slices that i felt i could have gotten at any nice sushi restaurant"
1607,1130,[],"there was a soy dipping sauce for the fish, that was to my liking, but it is also exactly the same thing that my dad makes at home with a whole steamed fish, nothing new here"
1607,1130,"[('fried shrimp head', 17, 34)]","there was also a fried shrimp head, again, available at any sushi restaurant"
1607,1130,[],"to me it was not inventive and the flavors has been done, i came here to taste things that i have never tasted before and half the courses ended up being things i can eat on a regular basis at home"

1607,1130,[],"there was a mole inspired dish, that was my bf's favorite"
1607,1130,[],that was probably the mexican theme part of the meal
1607,1130,"[('duck', 16, 20)]",we also had the duck three ways with the assortment of saucessides
1607,1130,[],"this was fun to try and pleasing to the eye, but not delicious as i had hoped"

1607,1130,"[('foie', 10, 14)]","there was foie which i was looking forward to, but it was a small abysmal piece"
1607,1130,"[('foie', 24, 28)]",gary danko had the best foie too bad not anymore

1607,1130,"[('pieces', 55, 61)]",to me it actually killed my palate because some of the pieces the ginger flavor was just too strong

1608,1130,[],i am sure the food would have been fantastic
1608,1130,[],we were excited to find they had availability on an evening that i would be in chicago to visit my daughter and her boyfriend
1608,1130,[],"when we tried to make reservations, however, we were told they only accepted tables of ,  or"
1608,1130,[],"no odd numbers?!?! this meant we either had to leave someone at home, add someone we did not really want to the dinner, or eat the cost for a ghost person"
1608,1130,[],not acceptable
1608,1130,[],
1609,1130,[],i really did not enjoy this experience and in fact almost walked out

1609,1130,[],i explained that truffles are only in moderation for me

1609,1130,"[('truffle', 40, 47)]","i tried to taste one of the very potent truffle dishes, instead of taking it all in one huge bite as directed they came running over and confiscated it from me"
1609,1130,[],"i gave the replacement dish to a dining partner, since i could not see if i liked it before being made to stuff the whole thing into my mouth"
1609,1130,[],unfortunately that made it an hour and a half between my last  small bites of food and my next  small bites of food

1622,1130,[],"chef achatz certainly does not need my approval with  michelin stars but for what it is worth i was absolutely in love with the flavors, textures, and artistic beauty of the dishes we were served"

1622,1130,"[('complex', 17, 24)]",the flavors were complex but completely approachable and easy to eat
1622,1130,[],the servers do an excellent job of preparing you for everything as you go

1622,1130,[],"not to say that there were not some things i liked better than others or aspects that could not be evolved but every single dish was thoughtful, creative, and meticulous"
1622,1130,[],you will have an option for wine pairings
1622,1130,[],"unless you have a true need to be exposed to rare and elite wine, you will be perfectly delighted by the bottom tier wine pairing option"
1622,1130,[],we are not wine experts but certainly know what mediocre wine tastes like and you will get really excellent wine if you go with the budget friendly pairing
1622,1130,[],a place like this does not serve bad wine so do not sweat this decision if you are not a wine expert
1622,1130,[],just go with what you are willing to pay for
1622,1130,[],"the service, as i said, was just excellent"
1622,1130,[],we felt welcomed and guided delicately throughout the experience
1622,1130,[],"although there is an element of seriousness which is well deserved while dining at a restaurant of this caliber, our servers always inserted playfulness and humor to keep us having fun and putting us at ease to really stay in the moment and fully enjoy each step of the way"
1622,1130,[],i will not go into any details about what we experienced because i think an element of surprise will maximize your own experience so just go! wear something really nice but do not feel like you have to be formal
1622,1130,[],think of what you would wear to an evening wedding reception in the city

1623,1130,[],"surprisingly, we were not shunned away to wait at a nearby bar"
1623,1130,[],my girlfriend and i were led to our table and pampered immediately
1623,1130,[],"the atmosphere and the decorations was very intimate, but open"
1623,1130,[],when i made the reservations i opted not to purchase the drink package with the ticket
1623,1130,[],i am glad i did not because the sommelier was very helpful
1623,1130,[],we are not drink connoisseurs and i am not a big fan of reds
1623,1130,[],"i though we were out of luck, but the sommelier catered to our drink tastes and complemented each course with an appropriate drink"
1623,1130,[],the courses are indescribable
1623,1130,[],its a you just have to go there kind of thing
1623,1130,[],my review would not do alinea any justice
1623,1130,[],"everything about this place is memorable, from the staff joking with my girlfriend and i puns galore, the sommelier's helpful guidance that champagne though, the courses that potato"

1629,1130,"[('oranges', 56, 63)]",everything they do plays with your senses whether it be oranges in dried ice or putting out a bowl of fire with branches from a christmas tree
1629,1130,[],i also cannot leave out their edible balloons
1629,1130,[],that was the best part! we had purchased the salon and that was enough food to make us full

1635,1130,[],i can promise the entire experience will be exceptional
1635,1130,[],i cannot say enough about the service

1636,1130,[],"service was fine, but more like around"
1636,1130,[],maybe  since the chef seemed like he had more snobbish attitude than the truffles he was serving
1636,1130,[],
1637,1130,[],needless the say the food was amazing service was also amazing
1637,1130,[],it is not one of those snotty five star restaurants where waiters are super stuck up

1642,1130,[],as mariah c stated it really is willy wonka fabulous with taste eyou did not know were possible and new heights of edible artistry

2693,1112,[],after an hour we asked how much longer because it had been minutes since we got the text the table was ready and their system said we had already been seated and that is why they had not come to find us so they said that regardless we were going to be seated next

2695,1112,"[('video', 10, 15), ('orange', 79, 85)]","check the video again, but either you or the waitress saw him pick it from the orange or red side plate to show them"

2695,1112,[],"i found mine in my eggs of the huevos rancheros and placed mine on a napkin and by the time we called over a server and you later came out, i went looking in my napkin and did not find mine"
2695,1112,[],"so, you actually picked up hair his and not mine if you want to argue that"
2695,1112,[],check the footage on to see me pull it out of my eggs in the huevos rancheros so glad you have the footage actually
2695,1112,[],please find that moment that i see it and put into my napkin

2695,1112,[],"i am also fully asian so my people's hair is actually naturally very, very jet black and i have some highlights but i would not call it brown"
2695,1112,[],"until we do a dna test, it is very funny you keep saying it is my long brown hair that we keep finding in dishes over the course of the two visits"
2695,1112,[],"to be fair, not all your servers hostesses had long hair that was tied back"
2695,1112,[],"i also cannot see inside your kitchen staff and your servers hostesses because sadly i do not have video footage of that it would be creepy if i did and i commend you for looking through your footage for these details, but please do a better job re incident"
2695,1112,[],"while you are at it, please check footage re last sunday"
2695,1112,[],i was disgusted and opening my mouth in shock as i was embarrassed in front of my guests and was uncomfortable since this happened to me before

2695,1112,[],"also, you are right"
2695,1112,[],i do give businesses a chance

2695,1112,[],"regarding the tip, i wanted to pay a tip proportional to the entire meal but you gave us a bill that had one small charge and resembled a bill of someone else's"
2695,1112,[],"why, of course, we were confused"
2695,1112,[],"i brought it to your attention simply asking for the bill that reflected our meal's entire cost so that i can give a better tip, i was met with a snicker and a face of annoyance"

2696,1112,[],guys
2696,1112,[],beware!

2697,1112,[],that is not my problem
2697,1112,[],also then some family got rowdy and a member of it attacked the hodges's

2698,1112,[],i love margaritas and was very excited to come here

2702,1112,[],hour limit on our table
2702,1112,[],"ok, but we waited for longer than that"

2706,1112,[],and we did not hear a sorry or apology from the manager or waiter
2706,1112,[],third thing the manager could offer more help but just said pay the money and leave and that is wen we said this is unfair n inhuman
2706,1112,[],and last thing the two hour wait after burn is because she was trying to ease her skin by sprinkling water and rubbing ice over it
2706,1112,[],and wen even after two hours there was no apology but only inhuman treatment given to us jus cos the manager wanted the money from us and suppress the matter
