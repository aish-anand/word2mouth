0,"my mother and i came here last sunday. the environment and the service were good. my mother and i shared a calamari as our appetizer, the calamari was ok. my mother got a  oz. filet mignon with baked potato and i got a salmon with baked potato. the steak and the salmon was so so. not delicious at all. both my mother and i do not like it. we had a new york cheesecake as our dessert, and i like the dessert. it was good. my drink was also good.",1122,4.0,Filet Mignon*,11/1/18
1,"my absolute favorite steakhouse in seattle  they have both turf and surf, but if you are going to the met, start with one of their fabulous appetizers such as the teriyaki bites oh, and come with an empty stomach, an appetizer can easily feed two or three people.  then move on to the entree - i love their filet mignon and prime rib.  they serve their meals with a baked potato the size of an appetizer plate and will load it up depending up on your liking right at the table  the meat melts in your mouth and the fat content is just right.  enough to make if flavorful, but still lean  the creme brulee for desert is also divine  my daughter loves the  layer chocolate cake also, but i do not know how she eats it all its huge. another plus is that usually once a year, some of the seahawks come and play waiter for the night. throughout the years we have attended, we met doug baldwin, cliff avril, big red bryant, kj wright and many more they take pictures with the guests and doug even sat and chatted with us  it was an excellent way to get to know the players and have a fantastic meal",1122,5.0,Filet Mignon*,8/4/18
2,"wow very nice we came here for a celebration for a party of . we arrived early but were seated immediately. our server was super nice and always checking in on us. we ordered crab cake, calamari and lobster mac and cheese for appetizers. i think our favorite was the crab cake, although i kind of wish it was cut into smaller pieces to share. it came in  patties and we tried to cut it ourselves and kind of made a mess. i ordered a  oz filet mignon with mash potatoes. ok heres the thing, one do not underestimate the size of the meat my eyes were bigger than my stomach so i ordered  oz and i barely ate  of the steak which was really sad for me. two, probably do not order an appetizer if your stomach is small like mine. after the appetizer i was pretty much full and did not have enough room for my steak which was the star of my meal. aside for my personal complaints about not having enough stomach size, everything was so good i got a medium filet mignon and it was very well cooked, pink all the way through and all the juice is retained making it juicy and tender. very creamy mash potato, must have of had a lot of butter in it. we also ordered the banana flambe and the bananator put on a mini show for us. to put the cherry on top we saw the ceo of t-mobile dining at the same time definitely made me feel like a celebrity or something.",1122,5.0,Filet Mignon*,6/15/18
3,"i've been to the met twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner.  it was very, very good. between the two times i've been there i've tried the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers, dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes, prime teriyaki tenderloin bites, blackened prime rib, and filet mignon . both the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers and prime teriyaki tenderloin bites were incredibly good, very tender, and packed full of flavor.  the bacon was crispy and fatty and added really nice flavor to the steak.  it was borderline too much of a good thing, but i'm not complaining.  the teriyaki sauce on medallions had a nice sweet and saltiness - teriyakisteak is one of my favorite meat combos and this is up there with the best of that pairing i've had. the crab cakes are really good. you get a lot of grab and a nice mix of large chunks of crab and thinner pieces.  there is good moisture on the inside and a nice crispiness on the outside.  it is really good by itself, with a little lemon or the slaw and sweet sauce.  definitely check out if you like crab cakes. the filet mignon was unnecessarily tender - in a great way - i feel like you could cut through it with a butter knife.  it was a perfect medium rare, had a good charcrust - great seasoning.  it was probably the best filet that i've tried.  really good. the blackened prime rib - not my favorite.  the meat was very tender, it was cooked perfectly, but i found the seasoning to be just too overpowering.  the salt content on the rub was a little too much for what i like - and i usually season my steaks very well.  the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, bu tender but the crust kept me from loving it.  good flavor, just too much of it and a little too heavy-handed with the salt.  i probably would not order this specific style of prime rib again. beyond the food - the service was great.  the servers are really friendly.  the bar staff has some pretty good stories.  what is really cool about the met is it is history.  while daniel's has a great view of south lake union which i love, when you walk into the met you  immediately feel like you have teleported to an old-school steakhouse because you have and  you see the rich history on the walls with all the celebrities who have eaten there.  daniel's has something similar, but it is not nearly as expansive as the met.  food aside, it is awesome experience to eat there because of the history alone. if you have the money, want to spend it and want steak - go here.  i feel like it is at the top of the pyramid for just-try steakhouses in seattle.  it is the perfect combination of great food and rich history.",1122,4.0,Filet Mignon*,5/24/18

5,"this was our first time venturing into the metropolitan grill for our sons th birthday dinner. service was good and the meal even better we ordered a tasty bottle of a spanish wine that was on the sommeliers suggestion list and it definitely paired well with our meal. i thought it was a little strange that our sommelier did not decant our bottle of wine since everyone else had theirs decanted. it was also weird how the floor manager guy in black jacket spoke to every table within our vicinity but not ours i mean for a ticket that was over  we could have used a lot bit of love and schmoozing but hey maybe we just were not black jacket dude worthy. but let us get to the food . it was fabulous i ordered the oz filet mignon medium well and it was delicious, my so who has a lot of food allergies ordered the porterhouse with veggies and our server was very attentive to his restrictions list and accommodating. our son ordered the  day aged sirloin chicago cut medium rare with the oscar added on and it was divine and for our little girl she ordered the cheeseburger for which she gave a double thumbs up. for dessert the birthday man got a creme brulee on the house, and i ordered the  layer chocolate cake i was so excited with dinner i totally forgot pics, sorry, it is a huge slice of cake with a side of vanilla bean ice cream and very decadent. overall, the food was great, our server was attentive, and it is as pricey as you would expect. only thing that i found slightly weird was the dated decor and the mirrors on the wall across from our booth, it made it feel like you were up in the business of the patrons seated directly across from you which did not help that they were grown folks trying to get jiggy with it in their booth not thinking that their friskiness was not being reflected into the mirror and was not up in our faces.but hey--maybe the steaks and wine has that effect on people. lol.",1122,4.0,Filet Mignon*,3/5/18
6,"this place is more down to earth and workmanlike than el gaucho or john howie it is a bit louder, brighter, and more casual--but the prices are just as steep. the steaks--the whole point really--are best at el gaucho, we think we are two adults and a  year old. we had the filet mignon at each establishment. the met's came in nd. we have less agreement on whose sides are best. here, we had the onion rings, which were amazing light and crispy breading, perfectly adhered to large cut onion rings, and perfectly fried. the warm complimentary bread was a delectable sourdough potato bread. wife and i got the roasted roots carrots, squash, etc. with our steaks, because she wanted to try the potato cakes also. both were great, though the cakes are really just a pile of hash browns. kid got the garlic mashed potatoes, and they were very garlicky. so, it was nice. but we all agree that we would go back to el gaucho first.",1122,4.0,Filet Mignon*,2/17/18
7,"let me preface by saying my fiance and i come here almost every other month - needless to say, this is our favorite steakhouse and the food never disappoints. ever. expect to drop a few pretty pennies. for starters, i would recommend their baby spinach salad if you are not into heavy appetizers. the combination of crispy bacon bits & fresh mozzarella is pretty amazing. crab cakes. good but nothing to write home about. definitely order the calamari though, it is got a nice little  kick to it with all the cherry peppers. the steaks. the steaks are amazing. i've tried their peppercorn, ribeye, filet mignon , porterhouse, new york. but my favorite is their blackened prime rib, medium rare. bone-in ribeye is also great tip you can request it blackened, which i recommend. i always get my steak with brussels sprouts and my fiance gets his with creamed spinach - we do not care for mashed potatoes or roasted veggies. and yes, you can ask to substitute. for the table, we always order the lobster mac & cheese - crispy yet tender with tons of lobster chunks. you do not need any sauce with your steak because it is so flavorful, but i need horseradish with mine. ask for both fresh and creamy horseradish. you can expect top-notch service from everyone working at the met - from valet to hostess to the servers. the servers are super friendly, not to mention knowledgeable, and very attentive.",1122,5.0,Filet Mignon*,2/12/18

10,"honestly, the met has been my favorite steakhouse for the past  years i went back today with my friends and we were all disappointed. it is just not as good as before anymore  we ordered - a dozen of oysters - calamari  - crab cake  - lobster mac & cheese  - clam chowder - caesar salad - filet mignon medium rare - top cap sirloin medium rare - boneless ribeye medium rare this is my order - new york strip medium rare - banana foster  too slow we waited for  minutes for our entree  im not talking about the old superpacked, - hour wait dinner night. i'm talking about a night with only about % tables occupied. it is not a full house night where all the seats were seated.  calamari they downsized the portion and it was not as flavorful as before  crab cakes the taste was alright but the texture was disappointing. the crab cakes were not holding on to each other.  lobster mac & cheese this was one disappointing dish  we could not taste the lobster in it probably because there were barely any lobster pieces in the dish.  overcooked boneless ribeye my ribeye was overcooked and it does not look like a ribeye  they had to make me a new one.  banana foster just as good as i remembered it was so good the sweetness of the banana plus cinnamon plus rum equals to perfecto. it is something you cannot go wrong i am not sure if i will be returning to metropolitan grill just yet. there are so many other restaurants i would like to try in seattle until next time",1122,2.0,Filet Mignon*,11/26/17
11,". rounding up anniversary dinners are great occasions for significantly increasing the food spending limit, to try what is never been tasted. valet parking was a little confused with where to take the car for valet parking, but it really is to drive up to the front of the restaurant. do not try parking in the biking lane, which is closest to the restaurant, but to the one next to it. did i semi-worry about getting rear ended, as i hesitantly parked in the next lane yes, i did. but not to worry. the valets are on the lookout and will make their way to you. as you see them disappear with your car, you will get a claim ticket, which you will need to show your waiter at the end of the meal and valet is not complimentary - expect a little over  charge on the your receipt. ambiance had a reservation, a few weeks in advance, and were surprised to be seated so slowly. the front was not as receiving as they could be, and i was a bit put-off by that, but when we were finally seated, our seats were nice. it is definitely a nice place, for a slightly old school romantic feeling, or just to entertain out of town guests to a pricier dinner. our waiter was very cheerful and in a friendly way explained what went into our meal. he gave us a lot of space to you know, take in the romantic atmosphere, and made sure our water glasses were filled. food let us break it down. complimentary bread came out warm with a scoop of butter. the bread was sour, but the texture was wonderful. soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. good starter for the following. raw oysters -  oysters  were shigoku and i do not remember the other . but all were delicious were brought out with a side of their house cocktail sauce and a champagne mignonette. i liked the oysters as they were with a little squeeze of lemon love that fresh oyster taste, but adding a little bit of the champagne mignonette was pretty good. the mignonette complemented the oysters very well by providing a smidgen of acidity. i would not recommend using the house sauce, unless you want to mask some of the oyster taste. but the house sauce was not bad. it just did not complement as well as the champagne mignonette. brussels sprouts with kurobuta bacon - not crispy and pretty bland. there were some pieces that were okay, but overall, it was not worth getting. after the first bite of soft sprouts, i made a move towards the salt shaker it just did not get any lovin' from the bacon and there was no drizzle of sauce to explode with flavor. i have definitely had much better brussels sprouts at restaurants like aqua el gaucho] and ruth's. wagyu] snow beef with mashed potatoes] - i've never been able to say that beef tastes sweet until i tried this. it had an incredibly soft texture and was effortless to chew. it did not melt away as i cut into it, but it melted in my mouth. each bite was slow and with purpose i savored that little thing. i could tell that it came from a cow whose life was privileged. would i get it again the experience was not something i need to relive and the price was hefty for a taste of exclusivity, so no. but, the side of mashed potatoes were oh-so-delicious they were, clearly, freshly mashed and perfectly savory. right amount of everything. absolutely perfect with the beef. the roasted vegetables were also incredibly good. they were sweet and soft - also very good complements with the beef. american wagyu] filet mignon - i actually enjoyed the taste of this one more than the snow beef. it is also very soft, but with a more savory and meatier taste. he had a side of asparagus with it. the asparagus was okay, but nothing special. i would say to just go with the mashed potatoes. for dessert, we were eyeing the white chocolate coconut cake when our waiter arrived with a candle lit burnt cream. i did consider, for a second, to still order the cake, but rationality settled and i kept myself from doing so. the creme brulee was still very good. runnier than i would like, but with a nice torched layer of candy-like crust on top. had to give it a good tap to break the top. as a complimentary dessert, it was a satisfyingly delicious way to end the night. to close all of what i've just written. the total came out to be around  including valet and tip. justifiable hm. honestly, i would not consider it the best of our choices, but it was good for our one night. we had a lovely time.",1122,4.0,Filet Mignon*,11/19/17

34,"my absolute favorite steakhouse in seattle  they have both turf and surf, but if you are going to the met, start with one of their fabulous appetizers such as the teriyaki bites oh, and come with an empty stomach, an appetizer can easily feed two or three people.  then move on to the entree - i love their filet mignon and prime rib .  they serve their meals with a baked potato the size of an appetizer plate and will load it up depending up on your liking right at the table  the meat melts in your mouth and the fat content is just right.  enough to make if flavorful, but still lean  the creme brulee for desert is also divine  my daughter loves the  layer chocolate cake also, but i do not know how she eats it all its huge. another plus is that usually once a year, some of the seahawks come and play waiter for the night. throughout the years we have attended, we met doug baldwin, cliff avril, big red bryant, kj wright and many more they take pictures with the guests and doug even sat and chatted with us  it was an excellent way to get to know the players and have a fantastic meal",1122,5.0,Prime Rib*,8/4/18
35,"i've been to the met twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner.  it was very, very good. between the two times i've been there i've tried the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers, dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes, prime teriyaki tenderloin bites, blackened prime rib , and filet mignon. both the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers and prime teriyaki tenderloin bites were incredibly good, very tender, and packed full of flavor.  the bacon was crispy and fatty and added really nice flavor to the steak.  it was borderline too much of a good thing, but i'm not complaining.  the teriyaki sauce on medallions had a nice sweet and saltiness - teriyakisteak is one of my favorite meat combos and this is up there with the best of that pairing i've had. the crab cakes are really good. you get a lot of grab and a nice mix of large chunks of crab and thinner pieces.  there is good moisture on the inside and a nice crispiness on the outside.  it is really good by itself, with a little lemon or the slaw and sweet sauce.  definitely check out if you like crab cakes. the filet mignon was unnecessarily tender - in a great way - i feel like you could cut through it with a butter knife.  it was a perfect medium rare, had a good charcrust - great seasoning.  it was probably the best filet that i've tried.  really good. the blackened prime rib - not my favorite.  the meat was very tender, it was cooked perfectly, but i found the seasoning to be just too overpowering.  the salt content on the rub was a little too much for what i like - and i usually season my steaks very well.  the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, bu tender but the crust kept me from loving it.  good flavor, just too much of it and a little too heavy-handed with the salt.  i probably would not order this specific style of prime rib again. beyond the food - the service was great.  the servers are really friendly.  the bar staff has some pretty good stories.  what is really cool about the met is it is history.  while daniel's has a great view of south lake union which i love, when you walk into the met you  immediately feel like you have teleported to an old-school steakhouse because you have and  you see the rich history on the walls with all the celebrities who have eaten there.  daniel's has something similar, but it is not nearly as expansive as the met.  food aside, it is awesome experience to eat there because of the history alone. if you have the money, want to spend it and want steak - go here.  i feel like it is at the top of the pyramid for just-try steakhouses in seattle.  it is the perfect combination of great food and rich history.",1122,4.0,Prime Rib*,5/24/18

60,"if i was rating the met on just the food this would be a  star review. i've been  times and each time i've left thinking, i would like those calories back. it just is not amazing. it really is not even memorable. took the boyfriend last night because he is never been and well when you talk about steak in seattle the met is always in the mix. i was not expecting to be blown away by any means but hoped for at least a good meal. here's what we had, their house bread a bottle of elk cove pinot noir calamari lobster bisque boneless ribeyes wroot vegetables choc lava cake burnt cream creme brulee what we enjoyed the bread wine lobster bisque root veggies both desserts notice the star of the show at the met, the steaks were not mentioned they were actually tough and difficult to cut even with the steak knives. i just gave up on mine about a quarter of the way through. the bright spot here is always the wait staff. our server was friendly, kept the wine glasses full. when she noticed my plate was mostly untouched she asked if i had liked it. i said, it was all ok but the steak was just a little tough. it was not meant as a formal, let me bitch it out moment just an honest answer to why i had not eaten much. she promptly removed the meal from the bill. i would have paid the entire bill without a complaint had she not asked. kudos for such a gracious gesture. the tip left was figured on what the bill would have been with that nd meal because she served it and took great care of us throughout. so now we can move on to other steakhouse's. boyfriend has tried the met and while you never say never it will be a very long while before we venture back. as far as price i see a lot of reviews for nice restaurants where people complain about price. i think it is really silly to go out for a great meal then complain about the cost. this ticket was about  with tip. chances are if you go you will really enjoy it. most do. for my time and money though i would prefer el gaucho or ruths chris.",1122,3.0,Calamari,9/16/17
61,"a great date night started here. this is the first time i've ever been to the met.  i would heard about this place a lot if you want a great steak.  now i can say i've been there and now i can disagree with everyone that says this is the place to go. i dig the decor which tries to keep it old school steakhouse.  the service was pretty good.  our server was prompt but not pushy.  drinks were never empty.  and overall she was just friendly and smiled.  she also volunteered to remove an entree from our check after a quick side comment about how tough my girlfriends steak was.  it was not even intended to be a complaint to our server, just a quick comment that was made during conversation.  while we did not think the removal was necessary, my compliments to the server for her awareness of what people are saying about their meals. both of us ordered the boneless ribeye. one medium and one medium rare.  both of them were rough around the edges and in a couple spots difficult to cut even with the steak knife.  i've only been to four steakhouses now but i rank this steak fourth of four.  el gaucho, ruth's chris and daniels broiler fall ahead of it, in that order.  the roasted root veggies that came with the steak were good. the calamari was good but nothing exceptional. it was the same calamari you can get anywhere.  the lobster bisque was good as well but a bit too big of a portion for what i was expecting.  tasty though.you definitely get a lobster flavor.  roasted poblano scalloped potatoes were great.  i thought it was a creative menu item and i'm glad i tried it.  for dessert.burnt cream and the chocolate lava cake.  both were bomb  the chocolate lava cake should be shared between a couple people though.  it is big and very rich.  for the burnt cream.get your own and keep your spoons to yourself.   we had the elk cove pinot noir with dinner and thought it was great.  if you are looking for a sophisticated wine review about flavor profiles, you have got the wrong guy.  it was not too heavy and went really well with what we had. i'm not writing off the met since i've only had one experience but there are other places i will try before i head back.",1122,3.0,Calamari,9/16/17
62,"we ate there last night. this is the first time i've ever written a yelp review. i just had to say something about our dining experience at the metropolitan grill. firstly the staff were efficient, friendly and informed. no issues there. what i do take issue with is the lack of quality of their food. we ordered filets, pepper steak and a large lobster tail. all top priced items. we also had calamari , asparagus and what was supposed to be roasted cauliflower.  none of it measured up. steaks cooked incorrectly, limp asparagus and chewy dry calamari . i do mean chewy. this is a popular seattle establishment. one that is been here for a long time. over the past  years, i've probably gone to - business dinners there. i think that may be the point. business dinners paid for with generous expense accounts do not get the scrutiny. however special occasion dinners paid for by an individual, albeit a retired ceo, bear a closer look. ok i get it. i should let it go. i can afford it, right well i suppose you are right. i can. but damn sam i hate to be top dollar and get handed sub par fare. i will not be going back. i will just remember the good old days when an  steak meant something.",1122,2.0,Calamari,8/28/17

64,"i've been here two times, once on a date and another this past weekend where i took my family out to dinner for mother's day. both times have been decent experiences where the service was great but the steaks themselves felt generic. since i went with  people this past weekend i was able to practically try their entire menu. from the top of my head we had for apps the seafood platter, calamari , crab cakes, lobster bisque. for entrees we had the filet mignon, the  day dry aged cap, ribeye, rack of lamb, dungeness crab fettuccini, chicken, and wagyu. for dessert we tried he cheesecake and banana foster. the steaks were hit or miss, everything that was not the filet mignon's felt a little tough and dry. considering i spent over  i expected the best steaks in town to be the best steaks in town. the chicken was overcooked and very dry but after we brought it up to our waitress she comped the chicken and gave us a free entree which my uncle decided to get the oz wagyu oz prime which was about  so that really made the service stand out. i loved how well she handled the situation and the mini history lesson with the banana foster guy was nice as well told us about how el gaucho was really el sloucho.lol. food was  and service was , would i go here again probably not unless it was free. but definitely worth trying at least once considering it is an iconic steakhouse in seattle",1122,4.0,Calamari,5/16/17
65,i've always wanted to try this place and today my hubby and i decided to treat our parents out to a fancy dinner so we decided to come here. i was super excited to see what all the fuss was about at the met. i ordered everything that sounded delicious because i knew i would not come back for a while. to my disappointment everything i ordered i had better somewhere else. here's how i rated everything. calamari was  crab cakes  scallops  spinach salad  claim chowder  lobster mac n cheese  american wagyu  bread  nine layer cake  carrot cake  service was great.  atmosphere  bathroom  really this place is expensive because of the name and the hype but honestly you can get better food elsewhere. i'm still happy i tried it. just do not go in expecting mind blowing food.,1122,3.0,Calamari,3/18/17
66,"came here for a company celebration during lunchtime. it was delicious the grill had a large variety of entrees and dishes varying from sandwiches, burgers, calamari , steak, lobster and more i ordered the american wagyu with the mashed potatoes and a side of caesar salad that can come with optional anchovies. the steak was great - but to my surprise what really made it amazing was the mashed potatoes i'm a sucker for great mash potatoes. our waiter was very accommodating and friendly. read us all the menus and made sure we knew all the specials and dishes that were not always on the menu. drinks were served first, then the dishes all together. the waiters would come by and check on us and always refilled our water was good since i decided not to drink but kept chugging water. finished off the main course and the waiter sincerely asked if we wanted dessert. i had the new york cheesecake out of the dozen or so items on their menu, which was good and included a few berries on top. overall experience was amazing, can be a high-end place if you order the steak or seafood, but also a great place to stop by for lunch if you want a sandwich or burger. must try to mash potatoes",1122,5.0,Calamari,3/18/17

76,"we visited the metropolitan grill for dinner on our first day in seattle visiting out of town and left with a lot of displeasure. after reading several reviews and hearing how wonderful metropolitan grill was, we did not have the same experience. our dining experience started off wonderful but was ruined midway through our dinner. we made reservations at  pm but arrived a little early at  and the hostess was able to accommodate us only having to wait about  minutes. once seated, we were greeted by our server requesting our drink orders and provided fresh warm bread to start with. he went over all of the meat selections along with the specials on the menu for the night. since this was our annual guys trip that we budget for, we wanted to try the best selections from the menu. for six people we ordered drinks ordered some specialty cocktails met mango margarita, mezcal mule and another drink appetizer king crab cakes, almond crusted scallops, french onion soup , lobster bisque and tenderloin tartar main entrees boneless ribeye, olive steak oscar style, cap top steak, hokkaido filet, ohmi filet,  australian lobster tails sides lobster macaroni and cheese dessert banana foster and hot apple pie before our order was placed we received our cocktail drinks and they were all good except for one. we then started receiving our appetizers which were also very tasteful and presented nicely. once our appetizer finished, it took quite some time for our steaks to arrive which we did not mind as the restaurant seemed pretty busy. however once our steak arrived, for a high end steak restaurant we would expect our server to ask us to cut into our steaks making sure it was cooked to our desired temperature but this did not happen and our waiter left the table. the result of this was that one of our friends that ordered the cap steak med-rare came out to med to med-well and both of our lobster tails seemed very tough or overcooked. in addition to the cap steak, the presentation was not expected as this meat was sliced into pieces instead of one whole piece like the others causing the steak to cook even more to a well done since the plate was hot and the juices were flowing out. after most of us started digging into our meal, it took almost  minutes until our waiter came back to check on us realizing that the cap steak was overcooked. he immediately took the plate and stated it would be - min to have another replaced and provided a small crab cocktail for the guest to enjoy while waiting. after - minutes everyone was finished with their food and the waiters assistant removed everyone's plate leaving the sides. we pushed all of our sides along with the lobster to our one friend that still did not have his steak to eat while he was waiting. finally after about  minutes he received his steak and it was cooked to the desired temperature. we all watched him rush on eating his steak leaving an uncomfortable experience since everyone was done. after our main entrees, we ordered the hot apple pie and banana foster for two. the presentation and dessert were both very wonderful but i would mention that each of the desserts could be for four people at least. around  we received our tab and it was well over one-thousand dollars after tip. this was not a normal dinner and like most people it is a privilege to dine out nice every once in awhile. overall for a high end restaurant, we did not enjoy our meals due to the experience and presentation of the entrees we had. we would not really suggest it to our friends or family back home. for a restaurant with a rich history and high reviews we really expected more.",1122,2.0,French Onion Soup with Swiss Emmentaler,10/5/17

80,"when i first lived in seattle around ten years ago and i would ask what is the best steakhouse in the city the answer was almost always the met. there were certainly some other worthy contenders to the throne - daniel's, el gaucho, john howie, and even jack's way out in issaquah, just to name a few - but generally everyone was in agreement that this classic old school place was a seattle institution second to none. and, they were right while other places could claim better service, more tasteful interiors, or attentive service, there was no better meat and the preparation there of than what i found here. work took me away from seattle for a number of years but since i've returned and been to the met a few times i've been really disappointed with my meals. i have been back three times and each time the steak has been cooked incorrectly asked for medium rare, got medium to medium-well now, they are always sorry and accommodating one time taking the cost of the steak entirely off my bill but serving steak at the wrong temperature is just steakhouse faux pas number one and should not be a pattern at the city's finest - after all, i have to sit around and wait for a new steak to be prepared and everyone else at the table likely is going to either wait or eat awkwardly while i stare at their food. in the past i've found the rest of the food at the met underwhelming compared to other establishments but it was always balanced out by the steak. this has not changed much with most appetizers and accompaniments being really standard, conservative stuff that never really entices me to try much. last time i ordered their french onion soup and unlike the usual dance of hearty beef stock with nutty cheese and a bit of wine, the soup itself is almost slightly but blandly sweet - i'm definitely not a fan of this one. the interior is in deep need of a refresh as well. the met usually has the lights adjusted a little brighter than i would enjoy i prefer el gaucho's flashlight required tuning and that has the effect of illuminating some of the age of the place the carpet in particular does not look like it has been replaced since the first day i walked in there nearly ten years ago. sadly based on my last few visits i think the met has dropped below all of the other great seattle institutions and even some of the new ones like the butcher's table.",1122,3.0,French Onion Soup with Swiss Emmentaler,2/3/17

187,"i have had a lot of chowder in my lifetime and pike place chowder is still my favorite though there are some strong contenders out there. that being said it does have it is downfalls long lines, tough seating, average breadbreadbowl but as far as pure og chowder goes, this one is still the best. first got to try this place when i took a seattle food tour. i was instantly impressed and fell in love. been back to seattle for a few times but for transportation reasons i ended up at the satellite mall location which is nowhere near as good. finally got to come back here on my most recent trip wondering if my memory steered me wrong but nope, this place continues to be the bomb. came on a sunday early afternoon with a friend. line was long but very organized. it ran down the hall but we were determined to stick it out. line moves very quickly and they offer menus midway through the line so you can start thinking about what you want. friend and i decided to share the sampler which was the perfect size for us. we had a bit to eat beforehand at the market but not a full meal and it was lunchtime but the sampler was plenty of food for the both of us though that did not stop us from scraping each bowl clean. there is also a yelp checkin deal for the sampler so you can get a slight discount. every soup has similar characteristics  perfect consistency smooth, not clump, rich but not heavy  good seafood to potato to liquid ratio enough seafood where i get some in every other bite  love the little bit of skin left on the potatoes which really enhances the texture.  a bit salty not in a way that you will notice too much at first but about halfway through you will be reaching for the water. though at the same time if it was any less salty it would be less delicious. every soup also comes w crackers and a loaf of bread. bread is room temp and just fine. it does its job of sopping up the soup. it is a fairly acidic sour dough which is nice too not the best bread i've ever had paired with chowder but we are not here for the bread. for our sampler we got the following also listed in my least to most loved  smoked salmon chowder  this is my least favorite but still tasty. it is probably the saltiest of the . the smokiness is there but i do get a bit tired of it after a while. both the cream cheese and capers are not overpowering. it does not taste like your typical smoked salmoncream cheesecaper combo despite the same ingredients. all of them meld together very cohesively into a flavor all its own. it is also the chowder that had the least amount of actual seafood but it was still a decent amount. .  seafood bisque really close call between this and the scallop chowder for nd place but scallop edged it out by just a bit. really great creamy tomato broth with an amazing herb blend and plenty of seafood. the potato skins worked the best in this one for me. .  seared scallop chowder  my runner up for the chowder championship. even though it looks very similar to the clam chowder the flavors are so different. plenty of sweet scallops and when i first got a bite i was so surprised they were sea scallops and not bay scallops  definitely a huge plus since these were so much meatier and butterier. you can taste the dill in every bite and the lime lifts up the creamy broth. absolutely love this .  clam chowder  forever the winner of my ongoing search for the best chowder of the world. not sure what else can be said. great consistency, plenty of tender clams, and a magical blend of herbs that i wish i knew. get this  overall, it is pretty obvious i love this place to death. yes, sometimes i'm embarrassed to admit my favorite chowder is pike place and not some hole-in-the-wall place i found in all my food adventuring but in the end it is popular for a reason. there is some great chowders out there that offer flavorstexturesetc that pike's does not but when it comes down to it, this is still ultimately my favorite chowder spot.",1121,5.0,Seared Scallop Chowder,5/17/18

221,"i've been wanting to go to quinn's for a while. i've walked past numerous times, slowing down just to gaze at the much hyped burger and hoping for a glimpse of the famous roasted bone marrow . i've combed the yelp page for reviews and pictures. google has let me know that i've visited their website  times just to ogle at the menu. so i was feeling considerably excited the friday evening i finally visited. i came here with my bf and we had a plan in mind. we split three items the burger, the roasted bone marrow , and frites with the foie gras shavings and gravy. the burger was solid. top notch ingredients really do make a difference. the beef, brioche, cheese. simple excellence. my only complaint is that since i was sharing it, it was a bit on the smaller side. it is too good to share. order your own i've never had roasted bone marrow before, so this was the dish that i was most eagerly anticipating. the bone marrow was extremely rich and fatty. it was a little jelly-like, which put off the bf a little so i ended up eating most of it. although i enjoyed it, there was definitely not enough of the bread served with it. we ended up taking home one of the bones because we did not want to eat it plain. the foie did not really come through very well on the frites but they were still tasty nonetheless. i have a bit of a poutine obsession, and while these are not poutine, it is a damn good substitute. i think these are different from the foie gras frites on the menu from the pictures i've seen. i ordered one of their ciders on tap, which i initially thought was at a good price, but it was served in a mason jar. and i was expecting a pint. oh well. i still very much enjoyed my experience. cannot wait to return and have a burger all to myself",1123,4.0,Roasted Bone Marrow,8/19/13

224,quinn's is one of my favorite spots on cap hill. it is nestled on the corner of th & pine with large windows to look out of if you are in the mood to people watch. i have found the bartenders to be pretty consistent with their preparation of the drinks and that says a lot because i like to enjoy a good old fashion which is pretty hard to make to my liking. i normally order the seared foie gras for starters and the wild boar sloppy joe topped with a duck egg for my main course. that combination is just heaven in my mouth. i recommend that you also try their roasted bone marrow which is an amazingly flavorful spread that is delicious with bread. they are normally pretty busy so expect a wait if you are dining in. sometimes you can get lucky and find a seat at the bar so always keep a look out. i'm a big fan of this place and recommend it to anyone.,1123,4.0,Roasted Bone Marrow,4/21/13

257,"quinn's has been putting out high quality 'gastropub' fare for a number of years now. it had been much too long since my last visit and it was nice to find out that the quality of the food has not suffered in the slightest. it was a later dinner so we did not order as much as we might otherwise, but my wife ordered a simple bibb lettuce salad, it was lightly dressed and accompanied with a few shavings of cheese and a few pine nuts. very simple, but packed a lot of flavor and would typically be a perfect starter for the table. i went with the old standby favorite, the boar sloppy joe with their frites . the crunchy little onions on the top give it a nice little texture, and the flavor of the boar is divine. it is a little gamey, but not so much that it would be off-putting if you are not used to eating things like venison, goat, or even rabbit. it is a bit messy otherwise you could not really call it a 'sloppy' joe, and requires a knife and fork to eat it without spilling everything all over your plate, the table, and yourself. their fries smothered in a rich marrow demi-glace and a fonduta cheese is a perfect pairing. call the sandwich a 'large plate' is a bit deceptive, though. it would not really be enough to call it a meal on it is own. it seems like it should come with the fries and if you want to upgrade to a salad that could be a few bucks more. as good as the fries are, i do not think they were really worth . they have a really good beer selection with a nice number of different micro-brews on tap, as well as a terrific looking cocktail list. i stuck with a simple red amber that night and usually i do not care for hoppier beers, but it paired very well with the food to cut through the big flavor of the sandwich. my biggest disappointment with quinn's is that the menu really has not changed much since they opened. while everything on the menu is done very well, i got the impression that they would be cooking seasonally, evolving their items, and instead it is the same basic list of choices even though all of them are extremely well done. for a reasonably priced pub with high end level of traditional fare, it is still hard to beat quinn's, but it is starting to show it is age just a touch.",1123,4.0,Frites,5/31/16

282,"loved this place we are from out of town so we were pretty clueless when deciding on dinner. we love the capitol hill neighborhood so after reading many reviews, we decided on quinn's. so happy we went there. the dual-level restaurant's ambiance was casual but romantic as it was mainly candlelit but not over the top fancy a nice shirt and jeans seem to be the norm. our waiter was polite but straight to the point. regarding service, at the end of the night we were not quite sure who we were tipping as one man took our order, another brought us our dishes, and the hostess refilled our waters and asked how our food was. food-wise however, it was spot on. my boyfriend and i split the quinn's cobb salad as an appetizer and the fish and chips for the entree. both delicious. if i were in the neighborhood again i would go back fyi seating is first come first serve instead of reservations, so plan accordingly",1123,4.0,Fresh Fish and Chips,12/24/15

294,"local  is a popular brunch restaurant in seattle. it is both highly reviewed and highly rated. i went to local  with fairly highly expectations per it is reputation. unfortunately, local  did not live up to it is reputation. for the positives, the restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was generally nice and helpful. we were here for brunch on a sunday and there was a nice crowd with a fifteen minute wait time for a sit in table and no wait for bar seating. the crowd was composed of families with kids, couples, and groups of friends having drinks with brunch on a sunday morning. also, the restaurant is well kept with an appealing modern industrial theme. it does a good job mixing the bar set up with the brunch restaurant. and lastly, the restaurant is located along other artisan mom and pop shops so it was a nice walk to local . i can see how folks can enjoy their sunday morning around the neighborhood. for the negatives, the food was slightly above average at best. we had their friend chicken sandwich with bacon, aioli, lettuce, and onion and their house made spicy chorizo scramble cheddar biscuit. the fried chicken sandwich was completely disproportional. the chicken in the sandwich was twice as big as the biscuit in terms of surface area and the other condiments were overpowered by the sheer size of the chicken . the spicy chorizo scramble was much better than the sandwich but it was just slightly above average in my opinion compared to other scrambled chorizo eggs i've had in the past. needless to say, i was disappointed with their food after my expectations were elevated from the reviews and ambiance of the restaurant. also to note, the restaurant charges a mandatory twenty percent service charge on top of the ten percent sales tax. so, our thirty dollar meal at the bar was rounded up to forty dollars. this is obviously not a big deal dollar wise compared to other brunch restaurants but a mandatory thirty percent fee can be a bit of a shocker especially after an average meal. overall, local  would be a fair three starts as the ambiance and service balance out with the slightly above average food they offered but i'm dropping it one star because of their mandatory thirty percent which left a poor after taste given the average brunch food they offered. so, local  gets two stars from me as i've definitely experienced better.",1124,2.0,Fried chicken sandwich,4/4/18

337,"so impressed with this place. especially with the customer service our party received from rebecca. i do not think our experience would have been as wonderful as it had - without her helping us today. my first impression of the restaurant was, wow this place is super cute  it is got a nice rustic  almost industrial feel. & it was very busy, even for a saturday morning. only downside is that you cannot ignore the old, mildewy smell that the place holds. we ordered our food a pitcher of mimosas, the farmers, chicken and waffles, & a chicken fried steak for myself. it came out quickly. though i thought, maybe a little too quickly on mine after noticing the puddle of blood on my plate my eggs and biscuit were just saturated in the blood spilling from my chicken fried steak . i waved down our server and let her know that i could not eat such a raw chicken fried steak . she apologized and had the cooks remake it. it was delicious everyone's favorite dish of the morning. after clearing our plates, rebecca came out with a complimentary dessert - an old fashioned doughnut covered in chocolate and strawberry sauce. when we were going to pay, i noticed she also wrote off my dish. i told her that she did not need to because it was remade correctly by the cooks and totally worth me paying for. instead, she said that she would just hope we come back again in the future. anywhere that has such a sweet, customer friendly attitude like hers-- that is where i love to give my business to.  thanks for the experience and great food.",1124,5.0,Chicken fried steak*,10/8/16

339,"it is been a while since i've felt as if it would be a crime to not leave a yelp review, but i felt it was important to share the lovely experience my friends and i had here last night. here's an important note when i have friends come to town and i want to show them the best of seattle dining for a more reasonable dollar, of course, i take them to local . their food has never failed to please all of my friends, even those with dietary restrictions. they go above and beyond when it comes to making sure that everyone's needs are met. that said i've obviously eaten at local  a number of times. i usually get a dish with fried chicken , or fried something, and what that fried something is sometimes varies. one time i had the chicken fried steak . another time i had chicken and waffles. another time i had chicken over their absolutely amazing biscuits and gravy. while i obviously have a thing for how they prepare their chicken , i've tried their other food off friends' plates and have always been impressed. last night, my friends got the pork belly small plate and the mushroom bolognese. both were excellent, and i was especially impressed by how much the pork belly was jam-packed with flavor. now, it is not just the food that is good here it is the service. even before they instituted the % default gratuity, the employees always went above and beyond to ensure that everyone's order was well-prepped and to answer any and all questions someone might have. i've been here countless times and i have never been disappointed with how i've been treated. they are always prompt to deliver more water when you run out, always willing to ask  about spices or ingredients in food, and are incredibly patient even when you seem a little lost or uncertain as i sometimes happen to be. last night, that very same service went above and beyond any expectations i've ever had for a restaurant. we got in a couple minutes on time for our reservation, but our table was taking a little longer than expected to clear. when we were at five minutes after the time our table should have been due, one of the managers i assume, anyway came over and offered an appetizer for when we got our table. little did we know is that he meant multiple appetizers when we sat down, he asked about our dietary restrictions off the bat and then said he would surprise us with three different plates soon enough. sure enough, we promptly received the deviled eggs, the focaccia bread, and the lamb poutine. all of these were incredibly flavorful. i'm a huge fan of deviled eggs, so i was easily pleased there, but they were easily the best ones i've ever had. the focaccia was great and freshly baked, but what really stood out to me was the cherry tomato marmalade that came with it. it was both something i would never think to make and so excellent and delicious that i wanted to keep it all to myself. finally, the lamb poutine was excellent. it is definitely a unique take on poutine, but the gravy was delicious, the curds were made with excellent cheese, and i'm a huge fan of lamb, so . that went over well. the entire experience made me feel a little like a rock star. and here's the thing it is not just because our reservation was delayed. i've always gotten amazing service here, whether with a couple friends or a group of coworkers. they always knock it out of the park. i want to add that i'm especially pleased with their dedication to paying their employees well and providing a living wage. the amount of thought they have put into taking care of their employees just shows how far and above they are when they want to make a positive atmosphere for customers to visit. they are up front and honest, and they do such a great job that i leave honestly wishing i could tip an extra % on top of the obligatory % or more, really. they will always remain a staple for me.",1124,5.0,Chicken fried steak*,9/2/16
340,"it was my first time today trying this place and we were seated fairly quickly during the weekday lunchtime hours. forgot our servers name but she seemed friendly enough. she asked us if we wanted anything else to drink besides water and then told us about their % mandatory service fee added to the bill instead of the typical tip. i did not like that idea first off. i know when i was in europe, some places do charge a service fee off the bat.but this is not europe i should not be forced to pay % if the service does not warrant it. moving along, i ordered the chicken fried steak . it did not take too long for our food to arrive so that was good. my dish was not anything exciting or worth noting. just your typical chicken fried steak which tasted like chicken fried steak should. the biscuit that came with it was pretty good though buttery, soft, great texture.  it reminded me of the fair scones, but better. the jam it came with made it sooooo good. overall, the food was ok nothing exciting. the service at our table was something else. which is why i do not like having a tip masked as a service fee shoved down my throat. after dropping our food off, we did not see our waiter once. only at the end of our lunch when we were sitting around awhile did she take notice and ask if there was anything else we wanted.  i think she could have at least walked by and checked on us once or twice during lunch to see if we needed anything. i had to ask another waiter for another bottle of water and a togo box. just from my table's experience, i do not think our waiter met the % service fee standard. there is a disclaimer on the table that said if you think the service was not worth % to let the manager know and something could be worked out. i wanted so much to do this, but i held back and decided to just suck up the service fee this time and just not repeat eating at this place again.",1124,3.0,Chicken fried steak*,8/31/16

377,"i usually have a bulls eye for restaurants serving locally sourced options with a hipster vibe.but local  was a bit of a let down for me. it was my first time in the city and i had read all about this place a restaurant that serves classic american dishes with a modern twist. it was right up my alley. or so i thought. i made reservations on open table the same day and due to uber complications we ended up at the restaurant about twenty minutes late. the hostess at the front was rude. i completely understand, we were late and our table was given away, but her attitude was a bit over the top. it took us by surprise since everyone in seattle seemed so much nicer than the people in la. fortunately, the general manager was in the front grabbing some menus and i spoke with him about waiting for a table to open up. he was super friendly and got a table set up for us within a few minutes. after we sat down and picked out a few items from the menu, we were disappointed to find out that a few of the menu options including the poutine and the rabbit liver mousse were unavailable. super disappointing. the waitress said they were in the process of changing the menu. we settled on the deviled eggs and the mussels and clams as appetizers, the  oz. rib eye and the mushroom bolognese for entrees and cheesy grits as a side. the deviled eggs had an option with dungeness crab but we opted out. they were very traditional with a creamy yolk and topped with peppery paprika and fresh herbs. i enjoyed the eggs but they did not stand out in any way. the muscles and clams were served with about half a loaf toasted fresh bread on the side which i thoroughly enjoyed. the sauce they were swimming in was composed of chili fennel cream, fresh bay and some citrus. the seafood was tasty but again, not very memorable. the rib eye was what we were looking forward to the most. priced at  a plate and topped with bone marrow butter, we thought this was going to be a steal. the meat was not properly trimmed and prepped. it was chewy and did not have the melt in your mouth texture you would expect to find with a good cut of rib eye. the forged mushroom bolognese had a healthy portion of mushrooms, house made mascarpone and topped with parm and fresh herbs. and lots of cooked red onions. a lot. i had to dig out the onions because it really took away from the tasty mushrooms and cheesy pasta. the dish had potential but was missing something. the cheesy grits were a nice healthy portion topped with a nice spoonful of butter and chives. how can you go wrong with cheesy grits. they were cheesy, herb-y and delicious. it was served in a hot skillet and was probably one of my favorites of the night. was it memorable not really. would i come back probably not. i was not super impressed with the service or the menu. our waitress was a bit slow and nonchalant and the hostess was a bit over the top. i did appreciate the general manager who was very hospitable and actually understood the terms customer service. nonetheless, he did claim that he would get an appetizer for us on the house and was no where to be found later in the night. the fact that the two items i really wanted to order were not available was a bit of a disappointment. paired with the fact that the food that we did order did not really have any twist from the traditional dish leads to an a-ok review. i expected a little more from you local .",1124,3.0,Poutine,12/29/16
378,"it is been a while since i've felt as if it would be a crime to not leave a yelp review, but i felt it was important to share the lovely experience my friends and i had here last night. here's an important note when i have friends come to town and i want to show them the best of seattle dining for a more reasonable dollar, of course, i take them to local . their food has never failed to please all of my friends, even those with dietary restrictions. they go above and beyond when it comes to making sure that everyone's needs are met. that said i've obviously eaten at local  a number of times. i usually get a dish with fried chicken, or fried something, and what that fried something is sometimes varies. one time i had the chicken fried steak. another time i had chicken and waffles. another time i had chicken over their absolutely amazing biscuits and gravy. while i obviously have a thing for how they prepare their chicken, i've tried their other food off friends' plates and have always been impressed. last night, my friends got the pork belly small plate and the mushroom bolognese. both were excellent, and i was especially impressed by how much the pork belly was jam-packed with flavor. now, it is not just the food that is good here it is the service. even before they instituted the % default gratuity, the employees always went above and beyond to ensure that everyone's order was well-prepped and to answer any and all questions someone might have. i've been here countless times and i have never been disappointed with how i've been treated. they are always prompt to deliver more water when you run out, always willing to ask  about spices or ingredients in food, and are incredibly patient even when you seem a little lost or uncertain as i sometimes happen to be. last night, that very same service went above and beyond any expectations i've ever had for a restaurant. we got in a couple minutes on time for our reservation, but our table was taking a little longer than expected to clear. when we were at five minutes after the time our table should have been due, one of the managers i assume, anyway came over and offered an appetizer for when we got our table. little did we know is that he meant multiple appetizers when we sat down, he asked about our dietary restrictions off the bat and then said he would surprise us with three different plates soon enough. sure enough, we promptly received the deviled eggs, the focaccia bread, and the lamb poutine . all of these were incredibly flavorful. i'm a huge fan of deviled eggs, so i was easily pleased there, but they were easily the best ones i've ever had. the focaccia was great and freshly baked, but what really stood out to me was the cherry tomato marmalade that came with it. it was both something i would never think to make and so excellent and delicious that i wanted to keep it all to myself. finally, the lamb poutine was excellent. it is definitely a unique take on poutine , but the gravy was delicious, the curds were made with excellent cheese, and i'm a huge fan of lamb, so . that went over well. the entire experience made me feel a little like a rock star. and here's the thing it is not just because our reservation was delayed. i've always gotten amazing service here, whether with a couple friends or a group of coworkers. they always knock it out of the park. i want to add that i'm especially pleased with their dedication to paying their employees well and providing a living wage. the amount of thought they have put into taking care of their employees just shows how far and above they are when they want to make a positive atmosphere for customers to visit. they are up front and honest, and they do such a great job that i leave honestly wishing i could tip an extra % on top of the obligatory % or more, really. they will always remain a staple for me.",1124,5.0,Poutine,9/2/16

420,"ugh, i'm embarrassed to have called myself a foodie or yelp elite or whatever and took my  girlfriends here for a late dinner on a friday night the food was bad and overpriced. the service was even worse i came here for brunch before, thought it was decent, and wanted to give this place another chance but never again here's everything that went wrong. the horrible service . upon arriving at the restaurant, my friends and i stood around awkwardly because no one was there at the front desk. finally someone comes up and tells us to seat ourselves. . found a table, which was wiped sloppily so i had to wipe it myself with the napkin on the table. my friends and i sat there for  minutes and wondered when someone was going to bring us menus. . i got tired of waiting so i went to the reception desk which was still unmanned and grabbed random menus, but only one copy of each because there were like  different ones. . waitress comes over and i ask for more menus since out of the ones i grabbed only one seemed like an actual dinner menu. she saw we already had some menus and says in an exasperated tone uhh, okay.what.how many menus do you need i immediately think, hold on here lady, we were sitting here for more than  minutes before you even noticed us. the menus we have, i had to grab myself, and when i ask you to do your job, you give us attitude . when the waitress came back to take our orders, she made us clarify ourselves multiple times. my friend ordered soup and beignets and said she wants them to come out at the same time because she is eating beignets for dinner. waitress says we serve food as it comes out, my friend says okay fine. then, one minute later, the waitress asks  so do you want the beignets to come out after the meal what the heck lady were you even listening . my other friend ordered french onion soup and it never came. we asked the waitress where it was and she says it will come out when it is ready. what kind of response was that as a good waitress, if your table's food comes out late, it is your job to go yell at the kitchen. it turned out, they gave my friend's soup to another table so they had to make her a new one. the horrible food . our fried chicken gumbo was disgusting. the fried chicken pieces on top were not bad but the soup tasted like tabasco hot sauce with cheap instant rice. i thought gumbo was supposed to have okra nope, just hot sauce and rice. my friend and i had to send ours back. . my other friend's jambalaya was no better but the shrimp and sausage at least provided some substance. same hot sauce taste though. . friend's french onion soup finally showed up. it looked really sad.minuscule bits of cheese floating on top, no porcelain ramekin. i've had better looking french onion soup at my college's dinning hall. . i was so upset with my dinner, i decided to skip ordering an entree and just get two desserts, banana foster, and a pistachio bread pudding. what came out was a bowl of caramel  soup  with a piece of mystery brown bread, bananas and walnuts swimming in it, with a scoop of ice cream on top. the caramel  soup  was heavily flavored with alcohol. my pistachio bread pudding was just bread, no pudding at all. my one friend who ordered the jambalaya saw how bad my caramel  soup  was and told the waitress to cancel her order of banana fosters that she had already put in earlier. the waitress misunderstood us again and said you want to send this one back no, we just want to cancel the second one that is supposed to have came out later. i do not know if it is because we were three asian girls, but our waitress seriously acted like she could not understand our english like we had accents or something which we do not and made us explain ourselves repeatedly. . did not hear my friend complain about the beignets but it is just fried dough. btw, the same # of beignets cost  for dinner but  for brunch. what are your prices rip off. the restaurant manager must have noticed that we were upset because she came over and asked us if everything was okay. we complained and she gave us half off our bill. she apologized profusely and hope that we would go back and it will be better next time. the manager's gesture was the only reason i'm giving this restaurant  stars instead of the  that it deserves. i will not be back though. the cruddy waitress might have been a fluke because the service i had the first time for brunch was fine but the food here is just that bad brunch is acceptable but late night dinner was the worst management, if you are reading this. i would be happy to revisit your restaurant but only after you inform me that you have fired your previous cooks and hired new ones. on top of that, please retrain your entire staff. teach them the damn basics like how to greet guests at the door and seat them, how to clean a table, how to give out menus, how to listen properly, how to make sure a patron's food arrives on time",1125,2.0,True French Onion Soup Lyonnaise,10/14/17

462,"okay. i put off writing this review for toulouse petit until i could try it out a handful of times and really get a feel for the place. i must proclaim i enjoy t.p. potty joke and the service has been impeccable each time i have visited. on breakfast a lot of people are of the opinion that a restaurant should pick a few dishes to make really well for their menu but i am the most indecisive person during brunch time so i genuinely welcome the extensive menu options here. cons i will say for the price i was not too impressed with the portion size of the blue crab benedict and on the day i ate that plate it was under-seasoned and the breakfast potatoes were soggy and undercooked. pros the 'city's best fruit plate' lives up to its name and the fluffy beignets are a table must. the caramel french toast is delightful although i have recently suppressed my inner five year old from ordering such desserts for breakfast anymore. anything with kurobuta ham andouille sausage will be delicious. i heart the french press coffee but a good bloody will always keep me coming back for more on happy hour -pm & pm-am the self-proclamation best happy hour late night menu in the nation is a little irksome but with over  light bites priced under  i cannot say i disagree with toulouse. cons do not ask what is on tap because they get it all the time- they only have bottle beers, wine, and spirits folks. also the music can get a little peso-ish i.e. now that is what i call chad jamz  at night time but at least here you will not have someone grinding up against you while you are eating. pros too many great dishes to list but barbecued shrimp, spicy lamb sliders , fried chicken, and the crab ravigote over fried green tomatoes are amongst my favorites. summary i know this place gets a lot of bad hype because of the owner's responses to reviews but i would not let what others tell you deter you from checking it out yourself. the atmosphere is really lovely, the wait time is nearly non-existent even on the weekends, and everyone who has ever waited on me has been a total doll. this is starting to become one of my default late night food spots.",1125,4.0,Spicy Lamb Sliders,6/9/10
463,"before i launch into my shamelessly glowing review, i must enthusiastically and wholeheartedly attest to gayot's naming of toulouse petit as one of the top new dining destinations  local.msn.comarticle.as. . in the country i would not know. but i have no qualms about saying that if you live in the state or are in town for a visit, get your butt over here. pronto everything we ordered was outstanding . yellow beet salad w haricots verts, stilton, and toasted walnuts chunks, not slices, of beets crisp beans perfectly dressed . crispy fried pork cheeks confit lean, toothsome meat especially loved the accompanying pickled shallots and apple compote . barbecued shrimp new orleans extra-creamy grits were omg good . crab ravigote on fried green tomatoes nice contrast texture-wise, both components were fresh and flavorful . fried chicken w tasso and black pepper gravy sorry, ezell's, i've cheated and this will not be the last time served with luxuriously smooth whipped potatoes and a tiny, scrumptious biscuit . spicy lamb sliders juicy meat, generous helpings of caramelized onions, some of the best frites in seattle . white chocolate bread pudding served warm and saucy loved the firm texture of the bread, wanted to lick the dish clean . bananas foster one of my favorite desserts did not disappoint sauce was not too rummy and ice cream melted into the pool of buttery deliciousness bananas were perfectly cooked one friend called the food genius. another said that she could not think of a single negative thing to say. and all the ladies thought that our wonderfully attentive server troy the bartender was super studly. not that tp's already sexy atmosphere needed anymore help. even tho we were here in broad daylight, it was not hard to imagine that this place sizzles when the sun goes down, given its plush, velvety booths, walls bedecked with candles, dramatic windows, and dark woodwork. that is right - tp does not skimp on hotness, so prepare yourself for sensory overload. i'm a little hesistant to call it my new favorite restaurant in all of seattle since i've only been here once. but after sampling almost a tenth of their glorious menu and loving every last crumb of what i ate, would not that be a fair assessment",1125,5.0,Spicy Lamb Sliders,5/11/10
464,"toulouse petit gets  stars for their happy hour food selection alone, in my book they had a ton - maybe -ish.coulda been , i'm horrible at estimating - of small dishes under , which makes it really easy to order a several things to split.the best way to eat at a restaurant.again with the in-my-book comment. we had the spicy lamb sliders and the asparagus with bernaise, and both dishes were addictively awesome. normally, i am one to pay attention to the drink specials as well, but i just ordered my favorite varietal because i was with my mom, and quality not quantity was the name of the game that evening.if you know what i mean. the wine was delicious though we finished-up with an order of the flourless chocolate torte, and all i can say about that is mmmmmmmmmm.bugahhhhhh. kinda wish i did not know about it is awesomeness, being that i live within walking distance of the restaurant. other plusses ambiance  awesome. trillions again with the estimating comment of candles all over the restaurant, with sort of a modern-new orleans feel to it.although i've never been to new orleans, so who i am to say sit-down restaurant in lower queen anne that opens before pm. sometimes you do not eat lunch and need quality food in the middle of the afternoon. close to the multitudes of bus lines.and my house. try it out **okay, one minus i wish they had a website. who does not have a website i cannot forward the link to anyone to tell them i need to bring them there.",1125,5.0,Spicy Lamb Sliders,1/18/10
