9000,Katie,9999,11/5/2018,4,"Before beginning our full day of fun and exploration, my friend and I ordered a small margherita pizza topped with pepperoni. Nothing makes me happier than lifting a slice off the pan and seeing the cheese stretch like there's no tomorrow. Each bite of that thin crust pizza with marinara, mozzarella, and basil was delicious. One small pizza is the perfect amount for 2 people.

There are three classic pizzas: margherita, marinara, and white. You can then build upon these pizzas with any toppings that you desire. These toppings come at an additional price. There are pizza specials with toppings already picked; you cannot make changes to these ones."
9000,Mindy,9998,12/5/2018,5,"Oh my, this was the most phenomenal NY pizza I had during my trip to the Big Apple! Worth the chilly walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. My friend suggested Juliana's and had mentioned it is the original Grimaldi's. Luckily, we were seated at the bar immediately. We came in for an early lunch, but at around noon there was a line forming out the door. The service was fantastic and attentive. Waters were constantly refilled and our friendly server showed us that small was actually large enough to feed two people. We ordered the margherita pizza topped with extra toppings (prosciutto and garlic) for an additional cost. Pizza was prepared fresh in front of our faces to our table and into our tummies. I would come back when I'm in Brooklyn!"

9000,Ayushi A.,9996,12/3/2018,4,"Definitely an experience, because you will be hanging outside the restaurant more likely than not in line. Note that around the corner there is Starbucks and ice cream in case you want to indulge ahead of time. 

Once you get inside the restaurant then service is wicked fast, which is super pleasant. We ordered the margharita pizza and the #1. One thing I appreciated about both is that they weren't that oily / greasy. So you could really focus on the pizza itself. Actually between the two the marg was my pizza of preference but our table was split between the two. Don't get me wrong. I think both pizzas were great, but would I say super exceptional? Probably not. But at least worth checking out for yourself! Prices are also very reasonable."
9000,Lauren L. ,9995,11/30/2018,5,"A great option when you are looking for classic New York style pizza.  This spot may seem new, but it has an interesting history that is woven into the history of New York pizza itself.  The original Grimaldi's pizza used to be located in this spot, before Grimaldi sold it and the new owners moved it to a new place next door.  Now Grimaldi is back - same pizza, same original location, different name.  The masses are clued in and there are regularly long, long lines to eat here.  Grimaldi's is still next door and often a faster option.  The pizza here is thinner and tastes a little higher quality ingredients, but both are delicious.

The best thing to know about Juliana's is that they do take-out!  Call ahead, pick up your pizza in a bag (no boxes), and walk out to the water to enjoy two of New York's best things at once - the pizza and the views!"
9000,Hannah V. ,9994,11/25/2018,4,"Be prepared to wait in an out-of-the-door line near the river in NYC weather. But I'm telling you it's totally worth the wait. Their pizza is super thin, crispy, fresh cheese and tomato sauce. My favorite is just a classic margherita with fennel sausage. The meatballs are okay."
9000,Mandi W.,9993,10/20/2018,5,"We arrived on a random Saturday afternoon at 1:40pm to a line out the door. The line was almost to Grimaldi's next door. 

My party of 3 basically got in line and started looking at other pizza joints to check out within walking distance that didn't have such long lines as these spots...

Well we had a 20 minute wait and were seated at the bar. FYI, if given the option to sit at the bar, say yes. You get to watch them make all the pizzas and oversee all the action. It was great!

As for the pizza itself... We ordered the small margherita pizza with half pepperoni on it, and it was delicious. The crust wasn't too thin but not super thick. Everything was perfectly cooked. Not greasy. Great size for us 3 girls - about 2.5 slices each. 

Note that this place closes at 3 so the kitchen staff can clean the oven.

If you come to Brooklyn, make sure you stop by. I have bookmarked this spot so I can come back every visit!"
9000,Michael M. ,9992,8/12/2018,1,"I do not take pride in writing this review, due to the excellent reviews that we we excited to experience, but here goes.

Great first impression, a gentleman greeted us and let us know a 2 top would be open in a few minutes. He pointed to the pizza bar right in the middle end of the restaurant where two spinners were open. Upon sitting down the lady to my left said her son was sitting there. Bummer. The host let us know it should only be a few more minutes for a solo table off to the right. 15 minutes later we were sat on the left hand side, they separated a four top by 6 inches and sat against the wall. Intimacy does not come to mind.

We order right away: Lg margarita half pepperoni and water with lemon. Shortly after a lady brings out a steaming hot pizza, full pepperoni. We advise them of the error and our server comes back, asks if it was half pep then gives me a look and walks away. Rude and inappropriate, especially without and apology. 

We go out for an experience and this was one of the worst we've had in NY. $26 for a pizza and we got treated like they didn't want us there. 

Honestly, I have had better $1 slices in Manhattan."
9000,Lauren W.,9991,6/4/2017,2,"The pizza is very good. However, their customer service leaves a little to be desired if you are trying to order for take out. We have tried on numerous occasions to order from there. It seems as if they try to discourage people from ordering to go by stating that it will take an hour, or an hour and a half. The last straw was a little over a week ago. I called shortly after 8 pm to order a pizza. They told me it won't be ready until 10 pm, is that okay? I said that's okay, but thanks anyway and hung up the phone. Then my mother tried to order a pizza from them a couple of days later around 4 pm. The person answering the phone told her that they are not doing any take out orders for the rest of the day. She told them we've tried to order a couple of days ago, and that's bad business. I take it from the reviews listed on here that they are doing so well that they don't care about our business. Since it's such an issue for them, they should just state that they do not accept take out orders and it's dine in only, then the problem would be solved."
9000,Torie W.,9990,5/29/2017,2,"We went to DUMBO and looked for the best rated places and Julianas was one of them. Pizza seemed like a choice that wouldn't fail and so we went. 

We were seated quickly with menus given, but were never approached again until we were given the check. The pizza itself was a little above average, but it was soggy from the first bite. You couldn't hold it together with pinching the sides at all. 

My water glass ran empty halfway through the meal, so I began to drink my bfs until that ran empty too. I figured they'd see the empty glasses and refill them, but they never did, until they asked after they dropped the check off. When we got the check we were surprised to see we'd been charge the full price of toppings for BOTH sides of the pizza. Logic would be that we be only charged half as any other restaurant. We pointed this out to our waiter and told him we didn't remember seeing this on the menu,and he agreed. He didn't know what to say and had agreed with us, so he asked the manager. The manager came over and told us that it was clearly on the menu. When we asked where, he pointed to the probably size 6 font at the bottom of the menu. We explained that we hadn't seen it and there was no asterisk to point us there, but he didn't seem to care. We kept trying to tell him that other restaurants don't do this and it seems deceptive to not even tell us clearly on the menu (does anyone read the tiny font without an asterisk pointing them to it?). He didn't care and looked as if he were bored and annoyed. So if you're ordering half and half on your pizza, make note that it will be full price for each topping instead of half. 

Perhaps it was because they reopen at 4pm after their stoking of the coal oven and are super busy with the influx of customers, but I still don't think this is ok service at all. The place is also extremely crowded - the chairs are super close to each other and it's hard to walk without asking someone to scoot their chair in."
9000,Dennis L.,9989,5/21/2018,3,"I walked the Brooklyn bridge today, from the financial district. Once exiting, I headed straight for Juliana's. Guys, there was a freaking line at 1pm. Seriously, a crazy line. I was standing in the scorching sun. The good news? It moved fast. Waited only 10 minutes or so. Such a quick line. 

I ordered the small margarita pizza. Added sausage and pepperoni to it for an additional $7. 

Folks, this pizza is overrated. Out of all the pizzas I had while in Manhattan, this one is the worst. Would I come back? Heck no. Prob will go next door instead, as that pizza joint was poppin too!

Pics are attached. Super thin pizza but super crappy taste too. Ya sucks. The pizza wasn't even piping hot. It was just mediocre warm. Blah!! Can you imagine eating a pizza that doesn't even taste hot? 

Oh well that's all. Not worth your time eating here. 

Also, there are 2 restrooms - one upstairs and one downstairs."
9000,Joe F. ,9988,5/7/2018,3,"More like 3.5 and I just had pizza.

It was my last day in New York and I was walking around exploring Brooklyn with a friend on a Sunday afternoon when we saw a crowd of people from afar. There was a line that must have been two hours long at two places that were next to each other, so we decided to order a pizza from each and compare them. I was trying to eat as much pizza as I possibly could while I was in New York so I was all in. 

We got margarita at each and honestly they tasted almost identical. I mean I'm sure some people reading this might be rolling their eyes and say one is waaay better, but it was virtually the same pizza. I mean there were some subtle differences, like one had a slightly sweeter sauce, which my friend said she preferred if she had to pick one. I was indifferent. 

I honestly don't remember which was which, but it didn't matter much to me, both were good but I can't say it better than some the wood fire pizza I've had in LA. 

Now this totally isn't their fault at all, but I completely regret going here because it was more New York style pizza I missed out on, which I can't get in Los Angeles. It in all sincerity bothers me every time I think about it. 

Also i have to say, had waited in that line I would have been utterly disappointed. I just don't understand waiting in a line that long for anything, much less food. I mean that's not really their fault either, maybe that's why there is place next door. 

But to sum it up, it's solid wood fire pizza and so is the place next door, but neither wowed me or seemed definitively better than their competitor. So much so that I'm posting this review for them too."
9000,H. Y.,9987,3/27/2018,3,"We tried this spot 10 years ago, not realizing that at that time, the original owner sold his shop Grimaldi's to a customer. I seriously thought that was the best pizza I've ever tasted in my life! We decided to try the same location but with the treat of the original Grimaldi's owners pizza, and unfortunately were left a little disappointed. We got the classic margherita pizza (again) and a couple beers. Wait was about 35 min.
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind-blowingly amazing like 10 years ago from Grimaldi's. Unfortunately we didn't have time this time around, but next time I'm in New York we're going to have to try Juliana's and Grimaldi's side-by-side."
9001,Paul A.,9986,11/18/2018,5,"Harris - i feel shameful for giving other places five stars - if this place is the benchmark:
Service - *****
Meal - *****
Ambiance - *****
Pay at the table electronic check - *****

I always get the lobster with clams - my wife get the petite filet mignon - she also is not really a meat lover but says this was her second best steak. 

This place is great - old world charm - hopefully it never changes. Classy restaurant with the food and service to back it up. It's a win all the way around!"

Service: 4.0/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.5/5.0
Overall: 4.0/5.0

Big fan of Harris'.  Great old school steakhouse serving great steaks.  What gets me about the place is why they bother to run such a diluted menu by serving anything other than dry aged prime beef - it's a bit like trying to navigate a minefield going down the menu.  Otherwise, all thumbs."
9001,Charles R.,9984,11/16/2018,3,"I've been eating at Harris' a few times a year for a long time. This is the sort of place you go after settling a case or otherwise having a big day.  Service tends to be smooth if a bit fawning, but the atmosphere is civilized and the tables spread out.

Last night I ran into a couple of problems.  I ordered my usual ""Harris Steak,"" a thick bone-in New York.  This is a fine piece of meat.  I ordered mine medium rare, but after a couple of bites it became clear that my steak was served medium well.  When the waiter checked in I pointed this out.  He offered to bring me a new steak, which was nice enough, but this would mean throwing out the old.  I am not okay with wasting meat, and I kind of think that this is the sort of mistake a top steakhouse should never make.  So I ate my overcooked steak and didn't even ask for a bottle of ketchup to chase it down.  I am a hero that way.

The other problem was the temperature of the bottle of wine we ordered - about five degrees too warm.  Different wines need differing treatment, and this should not have been brought to us a room temperature.

I'm sure I'll be back to the steakhouse I've long considered the best in town, but overcooked steak and warm wine need to be called out!"

Hostess: 3/5
Our Waitress: 3/5
Everyone else who helped bring out the food, cleared the table and helped us box our food: 5/5

Our waitress never introduced herself and was not very friendly. When she came by with the dessert menu she simply placed it in front of us while looking behind her at the other table then walked away. No joke, there was no eye contact.. =/  She was overall aloof. I doubled the tax for tips - to be honest I wanted to tip even less but I know part of it goes to bus boys as well as kitchen staff.

*Although the writing on the desserts beautiful! 

My 4 stars is basically for the Steaks. Harris has always been my favorite but after this last visit I think we'll be sticking to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse down the street. Always friendly customer service Good steaks, good appetizers and a bonus - Creme Brulee is yummy!"
9001,Mina P.,9982,6/18/2018,4,"A solid steakhouse in SF - if you're craving red meat, you've come to the right place. It is a nice restaurant with attentive service, nice ambiance and dim lighting... classic steakhouse vibes.

Overall a satisfying meal! Beyond the steaks, the sides were very good - creamed spinach was excellent. I also had the foie gras added to my steak but wouldn't add it next time as it didn't really stand out. Portions are very generous so be prepared to roll out once you are done! Oh and the wine selection was also nice, many local Californian options to choose from!"
9001,William S.,9981,8/13/2018,1/4/1900,"Okay, so there's a lot of 'Blue Hair' encountered in this iconic establishment. If you can get over that fact then you are in for a wonderful old-school steak house experience. I have been fortunate enough to enjoy this place for over 3 decades.

The overall food experience has slipped a bit since the matriarch of this iconic restaurant was last seen welcoming guests and guiding this place (she was a Bluehair too, BTW). I will still venture over to this place once in a while to enjoy their second-to-none beef dishes.

Their bar is still has a cozy, 'Upper Crust' and (again) old-school feel to it. On weekends they have a jazz pianist gently tickling the ivories for bar guests. Sitting in that bar will make you feel special and pampered. You might almost expect Tony Bennett to step from behind the curtains to serenade the unsuspecting patrons of this establishment with a tune or two.

The wait-staff is excellent at what they do. The bartender still knows how to make all the standards perfectly. There is usually not even a Hipster in sight. The man-buns will usually catch fire upon entering thru these hallowed doors I am told.

After the pre-meal drinking has subsided it's on to the main course: their food. 

I have seldom ventured far from their beef entrees. My choice has always been their executive cut of prime rib. Many might say that House of Prime Rib (HoPR) up a few blocks on Van Ness has a better P.R. I would beg to differ. Harris' can really deliver that large hunk of juicy wonderfulness cooked to perfection medium-rare is what few other establishments have been able to match in all of my years of adult life.

HoPR has much more a tourist joint feel to it. Harris' does not. Much quieter and a more stately ambiance oozes from their cozy comfy leathery table booths. That's another reason why you would choose to go to Harris' for your P.R. than to HoPR.

I am not too excited about Harris' side dishes (other than their baked potato), nor their desserts. I am here for only the meat. Take all those other dishes away, they don't much concern me. The Harris' Prime Rib (and their steaks, I hear) is the center of attention. Oh...their in-house made bread is the bomb too!

Oh...and they have a very wonderful side room for private dining while with a larger group. 

Mah-vel-ous Dah-ling!"
9001,Nazuki Y.,9980,7/24/2018,5,"I came here for my birthday celebration and enjoyed the foods and service here. Great for special occasions.
We had a dinner reservation at 6pm on Sunday. We arrived 5:30 ish and enjoyed before dinner drink at the bar. This bar is so classic and nice. There was many people enjoying drinks and chat. I ordered Harris old fashioned. I got the strongest and classic old fashioned here. My BF got martini. Many ppl got martini actually. They gave him a refill bottle.
Around 6, we moved to a dinner table. The service was great. Actually I got tipsy and left my cardigan at the bar but they found it's mine and brought it to the dinner table. At 6, there was not many ppl but after 7, it got busy even Sunday night. 
I ordered prime rib. It was fantastic. Gigantic. Juicy and tender. Went great with red wine we got sauvignion blank.
Most of customers here were classic, quiet, a little senior than other SF restaurants."
9001,Aileen L.,9979,2/23/2018,2,"Meh couldve been a 5 star but the people at the front reception & servers were whatevers. 
At a restaurant like this i expect the best service but the people here did not seem like they liked their jobs or wanted to do their jobs except the last server we ended up with. She was nice. 
2 stars because 1 food was good enough 1 because the last waitress was nice but i wouldnt say service was super spectacular. 
Could definitely use your money elsewhere if service is like this all the time ^_^ 

My boyfriend and i came here and it was SUPER COLD. They sat us at a small booth where the wind would blow every time someone opened the front door. We asked to be moved and there were clearly TWO other tables a little more away from the door but they seemed less than willing to move us. 
A BIGGER booth opened up and i wanted to sit there but the waiter and front reception person didnt let us because there should be a ""reservation"" for a bigger party or something. They finally moved us to one of the other open tables because i was being pushy... well Lol another couple, a pair of two got seated in the bigger booth 10 minutes after it was cleaned when they told us we couldnt sit there because it was reserved for a bigger party. 

Food: 
Creamed spinach, scalloped potatoes & filet mignon were amazing (steak was cooked to the perfect med rare) 
Sautéed broccoli and baked potato.. i mean you cant really go wrong or make it badly.. 
rib eye was a little over cooked otherwise good  
Bread and butter sucks here 

Overall whatever exp. 
definitely can get good food and better service else where"
9001,Henry B.,9978,8/31/2018,5,"Started the night with a round of cocktails and quickly moved on to a 375ml of Schramsberg BdB 2014 with a dozen fresh oysters. Ribeye, Porterhouse, Filet Mignon, and their sides were all ordered and accompanied by a 750ml of Sadie Family ""Columella"" 2004. Dessert was an order of Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, and a Baked Alaska paired with a glass of Taylor's 20-Year-Old Tawny Port and a glass of Chateau Rieussec Sauternes 2005. One of the highlights of the trip.

9001,Jackie T.,9977,9/21/2014,4,"Sooo celebrating a year and a half anniversary? Yes, we're one of THOSE couples. 
The boothang brought me here because he knew that I've been CRAVING prime rib for months since:
House of Prime Rib: been there done that
5A5: went for my birthday but ran out of prime rib

..so I guess the next place to try was Harris' (:

After we were seated and got our menus, we were served some warm, crunchy bread slices with butter and a dipping sauce (sorry I forgot what it was). 
After we ordered our food, we got the DELICIOUS, FRESH, HOT, AWESOME, BIG bread. It was some really good bread. Trust. 

-Soup of the Day ($9): it was lobster bisque so we HAD to get it. The portion was pretty big, to our surprise. WORTH IT. I'm not gonna lie, I was about half way full by the time I was done with this. It was pretty decent, but leaned towards the ""light"" side, flavor-wise. I was expecting BOOM, lobster in every scoop, but it was more of a subtle tap on the tongue. My descriptions aren't making sense anymore huh? LOL sorry ): Mr.Boothang did say that it didn't taste like Maine lobster though. Apparently it was very similar to the lobster he had in Santorini. 

-Roast Prime Rib (Regular Cut 14 oz $46, Executive Cut on the Bone 22oz $52) Comes with creamed spinach and your choice of baked potato or the evening's potato, which was mashed potato for us.
I didn't feel like being a fatty that night, so I opted for the regular cut, and my boyfriend got the executive. If you're not EXTREMELY HUNGRY, having been starved for a few days, then just stick with the regular cut. When the executive was placed on the table, our eyes POPPED. 
I thought to myself ""heh, what can I do with a boyfriend suffering from food coma?""
 A) steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me
 B) steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me
                   or...
 C) steal his wallet and run since he will be too full to run after me...

But jokes aside, the prime rib was pretty good. We both got it prepared rare, but it's more of a medium rare in my opinion, if it even matters to you. The meat was slightly tough, just a little bit. Served with au jus, every bite was pretty good. 
I think the House of Prime Rib still has the best prime rib, AND it's cheaper, but my boyfriend likes the prime rib at Harris' more. Is this a sign in our relationship, perhaps? haha jk 
The two sides were great! The creamed spinach was very tasty mm mm mm. The mashed potatoes weren't anything special, but the one thing that stood out was its smoothness. Like a baby's bottom. 
    
We were WAY too full after our main course so we didn't order any desserts. We only managed to finish half of our food. But hey, that means PRIME RIB FOR LUNCH the next day :D"
9001,Kathy A.,9976,5/24/2018,3,"3 to 3.5 stars. I expected to be blown away by this place but it was really only mediocre. Service was pretty slow throughout the night. We started with the mixed green and balsamic salad. For entrees we all tried a few different things. I myself had the salmon. It was bland. The scalloped potatoes on the side were good, however. One of my dining companions had the chicken with sherry glaze. It was pretty good. Another one at the table had the roast prime rib of beef. It was very good, as is expected from a steakhouse. For dessert we had the Chocolate Pot de Creme. It wasn't anything special. They do have some good peanut brittle near the exit to grab on your way out."
9001,Harry R.,9975,11/2/2015,5,"On the way back home from work, my parents had the most awesome whim to have steak for dinner b/c they were too tired to cook...and within minutes we found ourselves at Harris' XD

Simple, Clean, Classic - these words immediately came to mind as I walked into the place and we were seated right away in the piano lounge with live jazz playing.  To start off, we were served Crostini with cheese spread and warm Pain Epi supplied from Acme Bread Co., both were good and the latter was exceptional with its crunchy exterior and fluffy texture.

Next up we had the traditional onion soup and the daily special mushroom clam bisque.  Both were well done and I especially liked the bisque with the copious bits of clam and smooth mushroom flavor at the end of each spoonful.

Now, the entrees - Steak Diane, Pan Roasted Breast of Chicken with a Sherry glaze, and Atlantic Grilled Salmon with Champagne sauce.  Wow, just...wow.  The execution of these dishes was simply extraordinary and the chicken and salmon, in fact, have set a new personal standard against which all future poultry and fish dishes will be compared =D

The filet mignon was literally melt-in-your-mouth and perfectly complemented by the cognac and shallot demi glace.  The chicken breast was so juicy, rounded out by a delicious, zesty seasoning.  Finally, the salmon was so tender that it had an outright creamy texture to it upon first bite.

For dessert, we tried the Guinness Chocolate Cake and Classic Creme Brulee.  The cake turned out to be only okay - somewhat bland butterscotch frosting and dry texture.  The Guinness ice cream though, was fantastic and tasted exactly like the stout: no more, no less.  The creme brulee was very smooth and creamy, but I would've appreciated having it served colder rather than at room temperature.  

Lastly, the service here was some of the best I've seen yet: extremely well-mannered, great awareness and timing with orders and refills, and even the maitre d' and bread/water server came by to ask how our food was!  Suffice it to say, Harris' was by far one of the most impressive meals I've had in recent years and I look forward to my next visit.

Best impromptu steak dinner ever ;)"
9001,Elena N.,9974,12/23/2018,3,"The roommate's birthday and mine are a day apart. Yes, I have to share my birthday month with him! For our birthdays in September 2012, I decided we should go to Harris. He loves steak, I love meat, and we've never been here before. Perfect time to try it out. It was super easy getting a reservation for two thru OpenTable.

Since this was on the roommate, he said order whatever I want. Why, don't mind if I do! I did show a little restraint as I was hungry and everything sounded delicious!

I loved the martini as it was a generous pour with some on the side for good measure. My favorite app was the prawn cocktail. The prawns were nicely cooked and a good size. I also enjoyed the wedge salad. The iceberg was crisp and fresh and the ranch dressing was nice and creamy. The steaks however, weren't as good as I thought they would be. Maybe something with the taste of meat as it's aged, but I thought the porterhouse tasted a little off. I've had aged steaks elsewhere and loved them so I'm not sure if l just didn't prefer their aged flavor. The steak was cooked to a nice rare to medium rare though, which is what I asked for.
I might go back to give them another shot, but for a steakhouse, I wanted their meat to be better. Maybe next time it will be!"
9001,Danny C.,9973,3/25/2014,4,"My two favorite things in life: Meat and alcohol.

With that said, the girlfriend brought me here for a surprise birthday dinner with reservations at 7:30 on a Thursday evening. We were about 15 minutes late, but were seated right away in a booth large enough for 4 or 5, as some diners that had to who showed up later since the restaurant was packed.

What we had:
Eagle Rare Manhattan - MUST MUST order, strong and smooth, plus it comes with a little carafe on ice for an extra serving. (Exclusive single barrel bourbon whiskey crafted especially for Harris). PERFECTION in every way, I'm daydreaming about it as I type this review.

Complimentary bread and crostini with ""cream cheese"" dip

Steamed Clams Mariniere - Nothing special, kind of disappointing as the sauce was salty and too watery. Huge portion enough to share for 2 or 3 though.

Porterhouse - Grilled medium rare to perfection, full of flavor, and cut was large enough for a bomb steak lunch the next day
Pepper Steak - The gf ordered this and loved the sauce that accompanied the New York strip
Sauteed Button Mushrooms - Waiter forgot this, but we were glad since the portions at Harris were so large

We both opted for the scalloped potatoes instead of baked since most yelp reviews said the baked potato was plain.

Dessert:
Baked Alaska - Best one I've had so far and came with a candle for my bday which was a nice touch. 

Ambiance: More old school and classic with large leather booths. The high booths created a sense of space and privacy compared to the more cramp tables of other restaurants such as Gary Danko. One of the most comfortable and enjoyable dining experiences I have had. We spent almost 3 hours dining/conversating and the staff kept refilling our water and never once hurried us along. The staff also checks up on you without hovering or interrupting.  

Parking: Valet for $10 but we found street parking on the same block.

Total bill: ~$180

Notes: 4.5 stars. Free matches, postcard, and also peanut brittle at the front. Wish they had a larger variety/more creative sides to accompany the meat. Definite 5 stars if not for that.

9001,C C.,9972,5/27/2014,2,"For years when I lived in San Francisco, I came to you for special occasions, anniversaries, and just when my boy and I had a hankering for your pepper steak, prime rib, and onion soup.  Even when I moved out here to LV, I was a loyal fan--coming to see you whenever my weekend schedule allowed me to. But every time when I make a reservation with my OT account, your maitre'd would look at me bewildered as if he or she does not know what I am talking about.  Not once did I hear a welcome back utter from any of your staff.  But that's ok because your good food and og ambience lured me back.  Even when one of your not so exceptional waitresses charged my card an extra hundred dollars or when each and every time when you would forget our button mushrooms or even when your office staff seem more confused than I am when I make a call about some special request or another.

This, however, is the last straw.  I know it was not intentional but I was so mortified that I had to create a yelp account to break up with you after all these years.  I wanted to do something special for my boy and his parents in celebration of his graduation at your fine establishment and you messed it up. I called 4 times today, wearing down the already thin hospitality, just to make sure everything is still ok but alas I should have known better.

I will miss your onion soup :("
9001,Elle C.,9971,5/24/2016,3,"we went here for our 39th wedding anniversary always wanted to try it but never did, we had the crab cakes which was good and the scallops were fried and had a sweet chili sause with it. it was good .my husband had a Manhattan he's never tried it before . he thought it was ok . we each had a ribeye steak he had scallop potatoes with his and snap peas and carrot slivers . I had baked potatoe and the same veggies with mine it was really good the veggies .I also had the asparagus it was very good and fresh . my husband had cheesecake maybe he should have read the menu it had some strawberry sause on it .he likes it plain. I had the citrus baked Alaska it was different . it was about $250 without tip so it was $300.i told them it was our anniversary I see on some of their reviews they gave their customers dessert for their anniversary .we didn't get any. but the waiter did wish us a happy anniversary. the waiter was very good and attentive  . not worth the price . overrated  and overpriced we doubt we would go back ."
