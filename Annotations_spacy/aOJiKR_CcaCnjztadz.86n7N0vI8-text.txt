my girlfriend and i came here right at opening pm and sat at the bar since we did not have a reservation. we ordered the pig face and lamb ribs, which were both good, but that was where the good things about this restaurant ended. this was the absolute worst restaurant experience either of us have ever had, the bartenders were beyond rude and condescending. as soon as we told the bartender we would not be ordering any drinks, she glared at us and proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time we were there while being extremely friendly to the people next to us who were spending hundreds. someone needs to teach the servers that they need to treat everyone with respect, not just the rich customers. would never come back or recommend to anyone.
