hey this place is definitely worth a visit! plenty of seating and the menu has everything for breakfast and brunch lovers! most eggor omelette dishes are served with a choice of toast or pancakes. a great selection of pancakes with endless topping choices. and who can resist a place that serves soft whipped butter, not those frozen little packages of butter so common in most restaurants! kudos to this place for hiring great servers and keeping the place clean and appealing. see you next time i am in chicago!
