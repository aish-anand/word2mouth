girl in the goat was highly anticipated dinner that we planned three weeks in advance. i recommend making reservations as early as possible, the earliest we could get in was pm. it was still buzzing when we got there. sidenote the food scene in chicago was nothing less than amazing and girl and the goat blew our mind. we wanted to try as many dishes as possible so we went all out and splurged. starting with the ratatouille focaccia with baba ganoush and squash tzatziki looking back now we probably did not need the bread but it was warm and delicious in the dipping sauce. we had the sauted green beans which were rich in flavor. the confit goats belly melted in our mouths with the bourbon butter and lobster and crab, this was a favorite! the pork shank was my husbands favorite and one of the most substantial of the plates. of course we had to try the wood oven roasted pig face and this was my favorite. another melt in your mouth dish and the sunny side egg on top, yoke dripping over pork just sent my taste buds over the edge. we also had a seasonal dish of calamari that was great. we had a great experience there. it was already after midnight when we were finishing up but the wait staff was still actively bringing out food. our waiter was so good at explaining each dish that came out as well as the ingredients that were used. we could see the chefs through the open kitchen concept which i really enjoyed. if i was to go back to chicago, handsdown i would return to girl & the goat . if i am being honest, i would say it is a selling point for a trip alone.
