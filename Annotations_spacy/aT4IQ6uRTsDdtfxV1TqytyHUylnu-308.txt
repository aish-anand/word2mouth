i've been dining at san tung probably a decade. the dry fried chicken wings are a dream come true. worth writing your name on the dry erase board and waiting in the wind. i also enjoy the green beans and shrimp and leek dumplings . service is efficient and quick. prices are reasonable. highly recommend if you like chicken wings, so good!
