ramen was ok, but their horrible service made me speechless.first, i ordered the extra spicy miso paitan and thought it might be too spicy for me. so i asked for a small plate politely and took some spices and a little portion of the scallions out onto the plate. this waitress stood next to me and meanly angrily accused me that if i did not want scallions, i should have told them earlier. she even said it twice loudly. so rude. i was embarrassed but shook because i like to eat scallions but they put too much in my bowl covering the noodles and broth so i wanted to take some out. plus i just did not want my ramen to be too spicy so i had to took some spices out too is that something unreasonable to do that you had to act like that it is entirely my freedom to do whatever i want with my ramen, no anyway, i did not say anything to her and kept on eating.meanwhile, since my bf and i were seated under the ac, i was facing the wind and cold air for the whole time. it got way too cold, and my chest felt really uncomfortable so i asked another waitress to adjust the ac she did it happily friendlily and i appreciate that!the ramen i ordered was mediocre did not like the flavor so you know, i was not really satisfied with my overall experience.when it comes to the check, i did not want to give % bc of the first waitress's attitude and put % down. she, the same lady^, counted the cash in front of us and threw it back, be like tips are not included & you gave too little in a horrific attitude. me and my bf were shook honestly, if your service was good enough i would have gave you % or more. and i have the rights to give how much i want depending on the service not mandatory or at a fixed rate. now she has the decency to demand for more tips very unprofessional. she got so angry after i explained why i would not give more, took the money and stormed out.this lady makes me not want to go back to totto ramen ever again in my entire life. and i will not lol.
