i knew the moment i glanced into the dining room and saw the frumpy, fat midwestern clientele i would made a mistake. no matter. my suspicions were confirmed upon my first bite of the wedge salad. i do not know how this is possible but they managed to take a foolproof salad and turn into a bitter rubbery garbage heap. the lettuce was tough and bitter, the bacon were so incinerated as to be tasteless, the the tomatoes were watery like a bad taco bell garni, and the blue cheese was was overpoweringly astringent and sharp, so much so that it burned my gum line. the salad was accompanied by some cold parbaked bread rolls and some oversalted butter. the delmonicos streak was truly demonic a huge mass of yellowed fat and membranes. this was priced at dollars. i've never had such a fatty, overpriced cut of meat at a place purporting to be a steakhouse. truly terrible. the side order of mushrooms were rubbery and overwhelmed by a seasoning that tasted like it been lifted from the stoeffers stuffing mix. the local greens with garlic and lemon were drowned in lemon juice, rendering them indelible. my brother's chicken a la keene tasted like a delta airlines entree from the 's. needless to say we skipped dessert. come here if you enjoy a good tourist trap and want to spend + dollars per person for poorquality food in a stuffy, dated environment. the servers were at least attentive. our waiter insisted we doggybag our sides, huffily proclaiming them delicious!
