had dinner there with my daughter. we both had the french onion soup , she had calimari while i had the prime rib, scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach. to end, she had the carrot cake and i had the layer chocolate cake. what a disappointment. the best part of the dinner was the onion soup . the calimari was slightly greasy, but the biggest problem was how salty the prime rib and scalloped potatoes were. had to use excessive horseradish to counteract. even the end of the meal was disappointing. carror cake was moist, but layer chocolate cake was like eating sand. do not think i have ever tasted a drier desert. all this for over . money not well spent.
