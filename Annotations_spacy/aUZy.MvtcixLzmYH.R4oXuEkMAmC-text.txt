would never return. we are all sitting here still dumbfounded that this place is serving this quality of food. the soup tasted like a minestrone makeover mess. the quesadillas were weak. the enchiladas were so weak. the beans were awful. the guac was and so so bland. and they messed up my blended margarita. it tasted like a chemical problem.four us came in mega hungry and excited and left still hungry because we could not finish the trash that was in front of us.not worth the cost and not worth the doors being open to this place.again. never coming back. guys. beware!
