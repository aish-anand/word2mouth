i really want to give this place a stars, but my experience was not the best. went to chicago for a long weekend trip, and decided to come here to celebrate end of exams. we reserved weeks before and paid in advance online. we were presented with a course meal, some of my favourites included the lobster, black truffle , duck, and milk chocolate. the lobster dish included curry, earl grey, and grapefruit. the duck dish was presented ways including foie gras. the black truffle was presented like a dumpling, and as you bite into it the richness of the truffle and parmesan cheese ooozes out. the milk chocolate finale was a piece of artwork made in front of us, consisting of a centerpiece of chocolate, with splashes of violet puree, hazelnut, and cream on the side. i was not a big fan of the lily bulb, and rhubarb. the lily bulb was way to sour for my taste, i believe it was included as a palette cleanser but nevertheless, i did not enjoy it. the rhubarb consisted of celery root, celery branch, and licorice, and was a miss. overall, the presentation, creativity, and attention to detail in all of the dishes are spectacular. definitely a on that end. however, the taste of the plates were a hit or miss. in my opinion, there is definitely a greater emphasis on the presentation of the food versus the actual taste. the waiterswaitresses that we encountered seemed a bit pretentious. i felt like we were constantly being pushed to finish our dishes so they can serve the next dish, and this definitely detracted from the overall dining experience. only thing i liked was when we left the restaurant, the doorman called us a cab. i would give the overall service a .. overall verdict superb presentation of the dishes, subpar service. would not recommend. i am sure there are comparable restaurants in the chicago dining scene with better service.
