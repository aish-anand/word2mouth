had the corned beef sandwich. it was pretty good, just a little dry compared to other corned beef i've had.was not prepared for the prices. wanted to try the brisket but a sandwich with no sides is pretty expensive, so me and my bf just split. the sandwiches are big, i do not think i would be able to eat one by itself. you can get a half sandwich with a side soup or salad , but its about the same price as a whole sandwich, so not really a good value in my opinion.environment was pretty cool, but definitely an odd system for ordering. do not lose your ticket. i think next time i would do waiter service just to avoid the cramped order line.overall, i definitely thinks it is worth trying but just know what to expect.
