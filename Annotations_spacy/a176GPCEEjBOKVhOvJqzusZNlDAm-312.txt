san tung is my go to place for chicken wings! i went yesterday on a friday night for dinner and the wait was surprisingly short. at around pm, there were only people in front of me on the list. this translated to only a minute wait. oftentimes when i would pass by the restaurant, i would notice a crowd so large that it would have had to be at least an hour wait. i've been coming here for the last years with my family before san tung became very well known to the bay area community. still to this day, i order the same things chicken wings, string beans, shrimp and leek dumplings , deluxe noodle. although everything about my meal was delicious, i noticed compared to before, portions are smaller and everything is a lot sweeter especially the string beans and chicken wings. the string beans and the chicken wings used to actually have a mild spiciness level, but you do not get that anymore.
