my girlfriend and i shared lb. of sliced brisket, rack of st. louis ribs, the texas sausage , fries, mac & cheese and cole slaw. all of the meats had great flavor. the mac & cheese was great, as well. the fries were fine. the cole slaw was pretty mediocre but it is just cole slaw so it does not really matter. staff was friendly. came out to about for all the food and drinks which is about par for the course when it comes to quality bbq. they do not serve alcohol, by the way. would definitely come back next time i am in chicago.
