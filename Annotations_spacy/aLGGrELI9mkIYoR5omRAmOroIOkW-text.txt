food service . ambiance . food monorail cocktails , beet salad , pork belly , fried chicken with polenta and collard greens , and a side of mac n cheese , would have been perfect with more sauce, apple fritters . freakin' amazing and reasonable portion sizes. service it took a while to get seated even though there was a few tops available as soon as we got there. our server was amazing considering it looked like he was responsible for a huge section and it was packed. very friendly and was on top of his game. ambiance great little hipster space. only thing i would change is add some cushions to the booths as they were a tad bit hard on the bum and risk of slivers highly highly recommend, great experience
