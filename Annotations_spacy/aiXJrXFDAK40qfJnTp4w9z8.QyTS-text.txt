throwback to vacay time in chicago when i had a ball at this famous tapas bar! they say food must please all your senses! and these delicacies sure did! we started off with this lovely rose sangria paired with fried deviled eggs served with arugula and caper berries! followed by striped bass with fig wrapped in pasta and served with a drizzling of the freshest olive oil i have ever tasted! the highlight of the dinner was definitely the turkey leg confit served with crispy lentils and potatoes the meat was outstandingly tender and juicy! we had the caramel panna cotta for dessert which was a disappointment compared to the main course. tapas bars have become my thing lately and these pictures should tell you why do try out this place if you end up visiting chicago! ezeechef ezeetraveltimes chicago restaurantreview
