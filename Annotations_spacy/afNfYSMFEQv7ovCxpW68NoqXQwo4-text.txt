the homemade corned beef hash was unappetizing and gave me a really bad case of food poisoning. hours later and i am still trying to recover from it. my boyfriend got the classic eggs benedict and it was nothing special. i would stick with the sweet breakfast options as the berry pancakes were tasty.
