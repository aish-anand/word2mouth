i had been looking forward to this place for sometime. unfortunately it did not live up to its hype. i ordered classic eggs benedict with a side of pancakes, juice and coffee. first let me preface that i always order eggs benedict where ever i am. because i had to make it so many times when cooking i know what it is supposed to look and taste. this one did neither. if i wanted a half of a shank of ham i would have ordered one. eggs benedict is supposed to have shaved ham or canadian bacon. the hollandaise was also lacking in that it was cold and had no taste at all. the pancakes although tasted good were soggy and cold. again very disappointing. they really need a quality person running their line and controlling what comes out of the kitchen. doubt i will ever return but luckily chicago has a lot of other choices
