the four star review is really just for the original dry fried chicken wings since this is the most popular menu item here and you can see that every table got or orders. the restaurant is packed during lunch and dinner hours so there is always a wait time so i usually order foods togo. i do not find other entrees exceptional besides the dry fried wings . some entrees are very good and some are just average dishes so really depends on what i ordered here. i wish the quality could be more consistent across the menu. expect wait time if you come here.
