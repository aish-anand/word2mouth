just wow. this was one epic meal, and at a very reasonable price. my friend and i ordered plates, plus two desserts. the final bill was far less than expected. the food blew me away. the flavor profiles and design were stunning. arctic char, pig face , and lamb ribs were the stars, but every plate of food makes you savor every single bite. it is that good. this meal was one for the ages. service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. i cannot properly put into words how much i enjoyed this meal. i cannot wait to return, when i go back to chicago.
