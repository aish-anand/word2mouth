been here a few times and my most recent was right after they opened after receiving a piss poor grade from the city food inspectors. knowing me, your food are not good unless the kitchen is dirty. i'm serious, the best food in the world is always cooked by the hole in the walls. sorry, that fine dining shit is for snobs with their noses up in the air. if your stomach cannot handle it, cry me a river and work on your immune system game. i'm going to base this review on my most recent visit. came here with a party of for lunch and was seated immediately. waitress was quick and efficient. food came quick as well. i like rabbit but decided to go with something more plain. i opted for the spicy jambalaya, french onion soup and the beignets. the food was just meh.quite regular and nothing special. i found the jambalaya too spicy and i so hated how they just pre-dunk my baguette in the onion soup . next time i will have to tell them to put it on the side. overall, always had a positive experience here. i feel like the food is a hit or miss. i do like to come here at night because the rustic interior reminds me of interview with a vampire featuring brad pitt and tom cruise. toulouse petit was quite the meat market back in the day, if you are into that scene, but who is not i do not frequent queen anne too often so things might be different now.
