it does not get better for mexican in the financial district than mad dog and beans. just the chips and guacamole is a pretty good meal. of course you need a margarita to quench your thirst. it is what you expect for prices. they are not too bad though.i had the classic margarita. it is about at happy hour. that is not too bad, and it was a large one. for the food i just had the salsa trio, which was enough since i recently ate. this includes pico de gallo, roasted tomato salsa, and salsa verde. it is about , which is higher than it should be for just salsa, though it tasted much better than typical. it was fresh. this did not taste like it came from a bottle, and the roasted tomato salsa and salsa verde both were mildly spicy.it has a good fun atmosphere. it is not too crazy and people are chill. this is one of many mexican restaurants around stone street, and it may be the best of them.
