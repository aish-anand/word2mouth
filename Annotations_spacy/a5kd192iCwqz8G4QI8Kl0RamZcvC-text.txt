mad dog has a good location in the financial district among the cobblestone street. the appetizer i had was the chicken chimichangas which tasted great. unfortunately they only served and it was small. entree i had was the chicken tacos which tasted really well. they served four but they are small. the restaurant has a nice environment to talk to friends not too loud, screens for looking at sports highlights. the server was friendly and food did not take long to arrive.
