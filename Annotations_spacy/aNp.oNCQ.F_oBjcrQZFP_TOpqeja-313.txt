i'm not sure if it was because i gave into the massive amount of hype san tungs had, but after finishing my meal i was a bit disappointed in the quality and taste of food they offered at dinner. despite there being people ahead of us when we arrived, the wait went by very fast which was a plus. but take note you only get one chance to be seated once if your name gets called off the wait list, they do not mess around with seating you quickly. so if you do not hear your name called, you are out of luck. we ordered their famous chicken, but we asked for it diced instead of on the bone disappointing. to me the chicken tasted like a less syrupy version of panda express orange chicken , we also ordered a peanut sauce noodle which was amazing, the sauce was rich and well seasoned and the noodles were perfectly cooked in my opinion , we also ordered their green beans which was also decent. it was not as seasoned or oily as other chinese green beans i've eaten, which was a good thing we also got shrimp and leek dumplings the cooks forgot about our dumplings and we did not receive them until after they gave us our bill to leave we had to remind them we ordered it and when we finally did get them, they were tough, over done, and i feel they had too much leek which over powered the rest of the flavor of the dumplings overall san tungs was an okay dining experience. i would not go out of my way to eat here again.
