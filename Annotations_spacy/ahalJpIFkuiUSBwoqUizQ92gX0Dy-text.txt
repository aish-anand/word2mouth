this is chicago. we are not exactly a bbq town, but when a place has over k reviews and a and half star average you are doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out. the other day i did and i got to say, smoque lived up to the hype. go to texas, and you will wait in a hour long line for ribs that are really close to as tasty as these. the fact that you can get them in under minutes on a sunday is just unreal. not to mention it is actually pretty darn cheap too. full slab with sides was about which was way less than i was expecting. the place is a machine. line moves quick, your food comes out in the blink of an eye, and there is always a staffer there to answer your questions. the only other advice i will offer than has not really been said is to order more than you can eat. cold bbq the next day is actually really underrated.
