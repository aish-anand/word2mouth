after reading the reviews, i was expecting a very long wait for lunch. however, when i got there around pm on a friday, i only had to wait a couple minutes before i was seated! the whole restaurant was packed, but the workers were very efficient in cleaning tables and seating the next people on the waitlist. my table got the original dry fried chicken wings , black bean sauce noodles, and potstickers. we came in very hungry, but only ended up finishing the chicken wings and a few potstickers. i personally did not think the noodles and potstickers were anything special, but the fried chicken is something else. i had heard great things about it, and it did not disappoint! i loved the flavor of the sightly spicy coating, and the crunchiness of the skin with the tenderness inside. i would definitely come by again to order more of those!
