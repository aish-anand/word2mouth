upon the suggestion of the concierge in our hotel, we enjoyed a wonderful evening of celebration at this restaurant. we could not have chosen a better place. the atmosphere is urban and trendy without being pretentious hard to pull off, the food is inovative yet understandable, and the staff is one of the most friendly in the city. everything on the menu looked yummy, but we started with the dungeness crab over fried green tomatoes and the seafood 'nola' salad with dungeness crab and gulf shrimp. both of these were great choices, piled high with the fresh crab. for dinner the highlight was the grilled fall king salmon with chanterelle and wild mushroom jus, a simple yet flavorful preparation of the salmon. for dessert we chose a couple of old-school ones that have been updated perfectly toulouse bananas foster and white chocolate bread pudding. the restaurant is not large, so reservations are suggested. we loved the decor, especially the iron lighting scultpures that we were told was done by a former bartender. the gm stopped by the table and shared a laugh and a wine suggestion, and it was resonable and really good. the bonus, though, is that this restaurant uses local, sustainable ingredients. by the way, the floor to ceiling windows have a perfect view of the space needle.
