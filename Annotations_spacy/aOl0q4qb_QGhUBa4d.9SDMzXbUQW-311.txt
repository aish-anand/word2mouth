wanted to check out the hype here. ordered what seemed to be the most popular items dry fried chicken wings, shrimp and leek dumplings , and black bean sauce noodles. we ordered everything to go, minutes for a to go order so make sure you call ahead. we had to try calling several times as the first two times the answering machine picked up. the dry fried chicken wings were good, tasted like the korean wings. the shrimp and leek dumplings were tasty even without any dipping sauce. the black bean sauce noodles were okay, a little bland. all in all, decent place. would not go out of my way to eat here but if your in the area, it is worth a try.
