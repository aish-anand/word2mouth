wow! incredible meal indeed.i came her for a friday lunch with my girlfriend and we were impressed from staff to finish. when you first walk in, you will notice that old school classic ny steakhouse feel that adds to the charm and history of the restaurant.we were immediately sat, it did not look particularly busy on this afternoon. we ordered the day dryaged prime ribeye steak, the heritage pig bolognese and a side of delmonico's potatoes. no drinks for us on particular day but the wine list was extensive and looked impressive. the whole drink menu was actually displayed on an ipad that the waiter hands to you which i thought was very cool.first, the day dryaged prime ribeye steak. just wow. it might be the best steak i've had so far in this city. cooked to a perfect mediumrare, the inside was succulently juicy while the outside had a nice charred crunch to it. you can really taste the dryaged flavor. some restaurants in the city will say their steak is dryaged for x amount of days meanwhile having no dryaged flavor but this steak, you can really tell by the flavor that it is real.next, the heritage pig bolognese . wow again. it is large rigatoni pasta with a bolognese sauce made with pig cheeks. the pasta was made a perfect al dente, just how i like it. i'm a pasta fiend and this one flies straight to the top of my list for pasta dishes in the city. must try.last we tried the delmonico's potatoes. it was sort of a like hot potato salad with more of a consistency of gravy. good but skippable. probably better sides on the menu.overall, amazing flavor experience at delmonico's. the steak and the pasta were to die for and prices are typical of nyc steakhouses. i will be coming back again.
