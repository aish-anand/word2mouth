with , reviews and a rating i thought my experience at the purple pig would be much more satisfying than it turned out to be. do not get me wrong my meal was good, but it is not worth it to wait for a long time since they do not take reservations. if i lived in chicago and recommending friends on where to eat in a short amount of time, this would not be in the top places to eat... the place is super cramped everywhere. we walked in around pm on a weekday and got seated in ish minutes. they have several large communal tables, seating at the bar, and regular tables. we got seated in front of the kitchen areabar because those were the only seats left. pretty cramped and loud but it was fun to see the chefs making the food. my friend and i ordered cocktails off of the menu. she ordered a basic old fashioned and i ordered a house cocktail cannot remember the name of it but it was vodka based. our drinks were pretty standard in taste, and the presentation was nice but one of the main reasons why i gave the purple pig is that if i am paying for a drink i expect more than half of my glassware to have liquid in it. the large ice cube they put in my cocktail literally made up half of my drink see picture. i was pretty shocked because i have never ordered a cocktail where most of it was just pure ice. the menu changes pretty often and i believe the menu i ordered off of back in june has already changed most of the dishes are tapas style so the waiter recommended we ordered dishes each. we ordered the roasted bone marrow . one of my friends favorite dishes and she said this was just standard but the portion was very large, roasted pineapple pretty interesting flavors, asparagus the best thing i ate here, it tasted like pasta but the whole dish was just tiny cut up asparagus, and the milk braised berkshire shoulder the meat melted in your mouth and the mashed potatoes were delicious.
