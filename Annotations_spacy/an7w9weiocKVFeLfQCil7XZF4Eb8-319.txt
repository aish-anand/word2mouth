oh, san tung. i'm sad that this place was over hyped and underwhelming. we came around dinnertime, and luckily there was not a wait. we ordered the famous dry fried chicken, along with the black bean sauce noodles and shrimp and leek dumplings . the black bean sauce noodles were served with slices of beef, shrimp and calamari, and lacked some flavor. i felt like i was eating just flour with the dumplings . last, the dry fried chicken. sure, it was crispy and sticky and gooey, but lacked major flavor. compared to bonchon wings, the flavor here is lacking. but to each their own.
