strolling down michigan avenue, i saw the purple pig from across the street and recalled having saved it in my yelp bookmarks. within minutes, we crossed over and got the last two seats at the bar for a late lunch. we ordered + grilled broccoli with roasted garlic and toasted breadcrumbs in an anchovy vinaigrette + ricotta gnocchi with spring onion pesto, peas, and fava beans in a neck bone gravy + milk braised berkshire shoulder with mashed potatoes and puffed farro the broccoli and ricotta gnocchi were fantastic. my favorite was definitely the gnocchi. i especially liked the anchovy vinaigrette and neck bone gravy that accompanied the respective dishes wonderful sauces! the shoulder was unfortunately a bit dry and the puffed farro was not cooked all the way, so that was a bit disappointing. we lamented later that we should have ordered the bone marrow. the dishes overall have great flavor, although the menu feels like it is doing a lot. everything from cheeses to panini to crispy pig's ears, pork tongue, housecured sardines, grilled octopus, blade steak, and turkey leg confit . this is a super, super popular restaurant. we were lucky to get seats without reservations. the space is extremely tight, so be prepared if you are claustrophobic. i was shoulder to shoulder with my bf and a nice stranger. still, well worth a visit if you are in chitown and like the shareable tapas concept among close friends.
