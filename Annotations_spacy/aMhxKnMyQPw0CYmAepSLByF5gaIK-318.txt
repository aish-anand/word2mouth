i'm more of a buffalo wild wings kinda gal, but i have to admit that the original dry fried chicken wings from here have me feelin' some type of way. these wings are the numero uno reason to visit. if you are visiting to try other menu items from here, then get the f ck out. just kiddingother somewhat noteworthy things to order include the shrimp and leek dumplings and the dried sauteed green beans. no frills good food. anyway, back to the wings. they come out piping hot, savory n' sweet, and crispy. get ready for some major finger lickin' action. yum.
