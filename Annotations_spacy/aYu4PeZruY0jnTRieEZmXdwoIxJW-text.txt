ok you all, this chowder lives up to the hype. i was recently in seattle for a week and came here twice. and i'm lactose intolerant. the chowder is that good. definitely give the sampler platter a shot so you can try a bunch of chowders - my husband and i shared the scallop chowder far and away my fave, and i do not even like dill, the smoked salmon chowder, seafood bisque, and the market chowder. the accompanying sourdough bread was fresh, warm, and crusty. we also split a dungeness crab roll connecticut style for being on the pricy side, i was a bit underwhelmed could be that i'm a born and bred marylander and am loyal to my blue crabs , or that i wanted this to be more like a lobster roll .
