my boyfriend and i were doing some pike place food hopping and stopped in here based on the amazing reviews. the line was enormous but moved pretty quickly - we were wrapped around all the way to rachel's ginger beer and still only waited maybe min. we shared a four chowder sampler. we got the new england clam chowder , the seafood bisque, the scallop chowder , and the special lobster and corn chowder . the sampler came with bread on the side. we both really liked all of the chowders , we went into it thinking the lobster would be our favorite, but it was probably our least favorite. we realized the other chowders on our tray tasted more like a traditional new england clam chowder than their actual clam chowder did. my favorite was the scallop chowder and my boyfriend's the seafood bisque. if we came back, we would probably just get bowls of those soups.
