my mother and i came here last sunday. the environment and the service were good. my mother and i shared a calamari as our appetizer, the calamari was ok. my mother got a oz. filet mignon with baked potato and i got a salmon with baked potato. the steak and the salmon was so so. not delicious at all. both my mother and i do not like it. we had a new york cheesecake as our dessert, and i like the dessert. it was good. my drink was also good.
