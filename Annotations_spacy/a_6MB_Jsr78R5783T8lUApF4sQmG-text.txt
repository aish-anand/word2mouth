get the new england clam chowder . we got the bowl sampler new england clam chowder smoked salmon chowder market chowder crab, lobster, corn crab & oyster of the , we loved the new england clam chowder . the one we liked the least was the smoked salmon. i tried the new england clam chowder last and wow it blew the other out of the water. no wonder these guys have so many awards. we went around lunchtime but got lucky as the line was short. even then, the line moved pretty quickly. our bowl sampler came with slices of sourdough which was really just perfect for us. something about watching people order the chowder in a bread bowl and then proceed to discard the bread bowl when they are done just hurts. disclaimer, the bowls are pretty small. they have the bowl sampler as well. be sure to obey the table rules. and also look for the mat on the ground that says to keep clear. you will be doing everyone a favor.
