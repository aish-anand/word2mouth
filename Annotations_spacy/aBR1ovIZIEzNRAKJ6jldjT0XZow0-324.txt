i've been to san tung a few times and taken it togo countless of other times. the wait is usually pretty long for the weekend. i would say anywhere between an hour to two. if you go about min prior to when they open for dinner you will be able to be seated right away. i saw a large group walk in at opening saying they had reservations but i'm guessing they only take reservations for large parties. recently we ordered the original dry fried chicken , the pork and leek dumplings, the hot and sour soup, the garlic green beans, and the black bean sauce noodles. the original dry fried chicken is great because it has a bit of spice yet a bit of sweetness to it. i would not call it dry exactly though since there is sauce but it is more of a sticky sauce rather than something like buffalo wings . the pork and leek dumplings were not so impressive to me since i felt they were bland and super salty on the inside. i enjoyed the black bean sauce noodles and the garlic green beans. though i did like the hot and sour soup i did notice it tasted very spicy due to a peppery taste it was as if they used a lot of the grey pepper you see in asian restaurants so if you are not into that and a kick of spice then this dish might not be for your. portions are fair for the cost. service can be so so as you would have to wave down the waiters from time to time and maybe multiple times before they catch your attention. i would come back but if the wait is too long i would rather usually just take it to go or door dash it.
