overpriced. there were of us. three ordered entrees one of which was a burrito . one did not eat. one had an appetizer. we had about drinks for the table. the total came to . i put in for two dos equis lager, a coconut shrimp appetizer and a shot of cheap tequila. the food is unremarkable mexican fare. average at best. left feeling as though we would been had. everyone was disappointed. not going back.
