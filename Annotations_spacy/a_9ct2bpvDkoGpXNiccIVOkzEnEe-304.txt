this was my first time at this restaurant and even on a sunday night for a party of , the wait was almost hrs. i had high expectations for this place so when i visited sf, i knew i had to try it at least once since i was not able to on my prior trip but that was because it was with family and it is rare that the older generation would want to wait this long for food . anyway, i got the shrimp and leek dumplings and it tasted like i could have bought that from the supermarket and made it myself. i also got the black bean sauce noodles which was interesting because i never had it before. then. it was time for the original dry fried chicken wings and wow. those hrs were worth it and my expectations were met! when i come back to visit sf at a future date, i will be sure to return. there will not be any judgment if i only order the dry fried chicken wings, right
