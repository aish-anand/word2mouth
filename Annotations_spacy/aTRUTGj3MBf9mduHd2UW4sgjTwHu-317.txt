excellent food! everything we ordered was great, i want to order each item on the menu. of course, the original fried chicken was crispy with the best sweet and tangy sauce. the shrimp and leek dumpling were very fresh tasting. the pork chow mein was also worth noting. very large portions at a reasonable price!
