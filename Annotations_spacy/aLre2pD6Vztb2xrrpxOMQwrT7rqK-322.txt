, + reviews & . stars for fried chicken put this place on the map for my boyfriend and me. upon arriving we saw a large crowd of people waiting outside so my boyfriend dropped me off in front while he went to look for parking. your whole party needs to be here in order to be seated . the whiteboard to write your name is to your right as soon as you enter. put your name down and wait. the place is relatively small, so not much space but i did notice a small separate dining room for a larger party. it was not that long before we were seated maybe minutes i'm pretty patient so wait times do not bother me too much. we ordered orders of the original dry fried chicken not sure why it is called dry because they are the exact opposite. chicken is moist and covered in sauce. the sauce is sweet, tangy, and salty. it has some red pepper flakes in it. reminded me of panda express's orange chicken but better. plus they use drummettes & wings . this is what they are known for and my boyfriend and i were fans! soo good. szechuan roasted duck & buns one of my fave chinese wedding dishes which i had to introduce to my mexican boyfriend. he fell in love! he cleaned the bones and basically ate whole thing by himself. i personally think i've had better but i'm just glad he liked it. the dry black bean noodles were alright. definitely nothing out of this world. the texture of the mushy noodles kind of grossed me out. overall i give this place . stars rounding to . the chicken alone made up for the lack of customer service. the servers were disgruntled and some of the plates and tea cups were dirty. overall i had a great time and we took home leftovers.
