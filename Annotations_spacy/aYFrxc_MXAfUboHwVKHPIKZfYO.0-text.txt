we ate there last night. this is the first time i've ever written a yelp review. i just had to say something about our dining experience at the metropolitan grill. firstly the staff were efficient, friendly and informed. no issues there. what i do take issue with is the lack of quality of their food. we ordered filets, pepper steak and a large lobster tail. all top priced items. we also had calamari , asparagus and what was supposed to be roasted cauliflower. none of it measured up. steaks cooked incorrectly, limp asparagus and chewy dry calamari . i do mean chewy. this is a popular seattle establishment. one that is been here for a long time. over the past years, i've probably gone to - business dinners there. i think that may be the point. business dinners paid for with generous expense accounts do not get the scrutiny. however special occasion dinners paid for by an individual, albeit a retired ceo, bear a closer look. ok i get it. i should let it go. i can afford it, right well i suppose you are right. i can. but damn sam i hate to be top dollar and get handed sub par fare. i will not be going back. i will just remember the good old days when an steak meant something.
