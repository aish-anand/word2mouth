lobster roll i thought the serving size was pretty big. i got it delivered and had to eat it in two sittings. it was mainly claw meat. was pretty good, not over the top extraordinary or anything. but the serving size was substantial.clam chowder get this. i like this way more than the lobster roll. salt & vinegar cape cod chips do not get this. way too much vinegar. if you like drinking vinegar straight, you might like this.blueberry sodado not get this. tastes like nothing. it is basically water with a sprinkle of sugar and some bluish color. just get regular water.
