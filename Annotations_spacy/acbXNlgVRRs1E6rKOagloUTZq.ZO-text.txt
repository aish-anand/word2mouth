the food was great, as we had been told by friends although great, my husband said he liked the steak better from places such as john howie and daniel's. wine selection was amazing, as they had a large amount of half bottles perfect as only my husband drinks wine. they also had three cider selections, which i was pleased with. the calamari was amazing, probably the best i've ever had high quality, perfect type & amount of breading, and a nice sauce. the french onion soup was good. steak was great. asparagus with bernaise was good. mashed potatoes were great. ceasar salad was great. creme brulee was amazing. however, the ambiance was not what we have come to expect from high end steakhouses like this.the entire place is open ie. not private, and the decor is dated. even the menu material seemed cheap laminated. however, they are closing soon for months for a remodel, so hopefully that will be fixed. the service was great, but not amazing, like we would expect for a dinner. for example, after our dessert was cleared we waited about minutes for the check, our server nowhere to be seen. for the price, we are more likely to go to john howie or daniel's we were not a fan of el gaucho, and are kinda over ruth's chris.
