toulouse petit gets stars for their happy hour food selection alone, in my book they had a ton - maybe -ish.coulda been , i'm horrible at estimating - of small dishes under , which makes it really easy to order a several things to split.the best way to eat at a restaurant.again with the in-my-book comment. we had the spicy lamb sliders and the asparagus with bernaise, and both dishes were addictively awesome. normally, i am one to pay attention to the drink specials as well, but i just ordered my favorite varietal because i was with my mom, and quality not quantity was the name of the game that evening.if you know what i mean. the wine was delicious though we finished-up with an order of the flourless chocolate torte, and all i can say about that is mmmmmmmmmm.bugahhhhhh. kinda wish i did not know about it is awesomeness, being that i live within walking distance of the restaurant. other plusses ambiance awesome. trillions again with the estimating comment of candles all over the restaurant, with sort of a modern-new orleans feel to it.although i've never been to new orleans, so who i am to say sit-down restaurant in lower queen anne that opens before pm. sometimes you do not eat lunch and need quality food in the middle of the afternoon. close to the multitudes of bus lines.and my house. try it out **okay, one minus i wish they had a website. who does not have a website i cannot forward the link to anyone to tell them i need to bring them there.
