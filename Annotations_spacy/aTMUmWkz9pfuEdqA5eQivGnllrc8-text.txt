a must!! i liked it more than girl and the goat and we just showed up a little after opening and were seated immediately. no wait. we had the octopus, beet salad, pork shoulder, butternut squash soup, and pigs ear . all great pics! we looked over and the table next to us had almost exactly the same thing. guess all the reviews are true and you should get them because they are the most popular for a reason! my favorites were the octopus and pork shoulder. the mashed potatoes and gravy beneath the pork shoulder were heavenly. the octopus is the best i have ever had!! i am drooling thinking about it. the pigs ear dish was also delicious! i was scraping the plate clean. i would not let them clear the table until the plate was spotless, it was so good.
