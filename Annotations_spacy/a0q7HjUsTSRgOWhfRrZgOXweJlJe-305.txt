delicious. worth it. must try! my gosh, this place hands down has the best chinese food ever. i thought korea's chinese food was hella good but dang, san tung definitely raises the bar. going in i had high expectations because my brother would not stop raving about this place and let me tell you, this restaurant did not disappoint. black bean noodle noodles were perfectly cooked, sauce was so flavorful and i loved how there was no pork! chicken wings wow so amazing lol puts all the other wing places to shame. so sweet and savory with a good amount of meat on each piece of wing. i am going to crave these for sure. shrimp and leek dumplings so simple, yet so good! only thing is i wish they had put more shrimp inside. please open a restaurant in socal!! i will be your # customer lol
