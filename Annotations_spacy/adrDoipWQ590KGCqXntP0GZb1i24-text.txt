the sides shine more than the ramen here! this is one of the few ramen bars in nyc that oozes an authentic japanese basement ramen shop vibe. too bad you have to tip and your do not pay a vending machine.i had the spicy bang bang boiled chicken as a side, i did not have high expectations for it, but it was amazing. it was zesty and the chicken had texture but was not rubbery. the crunchy bean sprouts complemented the chicken well.the chicken paitan based broth did not have a very strong taste to it. there was a lil bit of umami, but not that intense. it was good, but i expected more. there is better chicken paitan broth in nyc. noodles, pork belly and the pulled pork was top notch. the cabbage and garlic were nice touches. overall excellent taste and textures. if you have been here in the past, the mega paitan ramen, the price went up a lil bit and you only get half an egg now.lines can be long, but not as bad as some of the other popular from japan chains in manhattan. they are efficient by taking your orders ahead of time.
