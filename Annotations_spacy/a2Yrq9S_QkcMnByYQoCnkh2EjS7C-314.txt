i do not really like chinese food, which makes this harder. it is a real struggle between three and four. all around they are very much as one would expect a chinese restaurant to be nothing special, but solid american style chinese food except those chicken wings are above par. their dry fried chicken wings are quite good. very nicely fried, and the sauces is pretty tasty although i could have gone spicier maybe if i were not white they would have made them spicier who knows. the other things eh. tasted like chinese food. we got the green beans another chinese dish i can sometimes handle and they were ok but i've definitely had better. we also got fried rice which was fine but did not stand out in anyway. last we got shrimp and leek dumplings , which i did not try, but my husband stays they were standard. they do get busy but they also seat people at their large family tables that do not know each other so that helps.
