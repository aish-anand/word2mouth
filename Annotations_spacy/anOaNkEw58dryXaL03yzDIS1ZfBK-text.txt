just under a year ago, i was in nola. i came here expecting to get some of the same creole style cooking. i was not disappointed at all shrimp and chicken jambalaya - . i was worried that this jambalaya would not measure up to my expectations, but i was dead wrong. strong spice from the pepper, hearty portions of shrimp, sausage slices and chicken in a cast-iron skillet cannot go wrong. crispy fried chicken gumbo - . not quite as thick as the gumbo i had back down in nola, but this still had the strong, powerful flavors i remember. the fried chicken was a lovely touch added into the gumbo, not on the side and it is crunchy texture served as a great contrast to the soup . crawfish beignets with red pepper chow chow - . this caught my eye since i had not heard of beignets being done in the savory fashion. it turns out this is quite similar to hush puppies rather than cafe du monde beignets. cauliflower soup with dungeness crab - . creamy, but light - this cauliflower soup was a great starter. would gladly order this again if i'm looking for something that does not have the strong punch of the other dishes. french onion soup lyonnaise - . unfortunately, this was a miss. nothing wrong with the way the dish was cooked, but it just did not resonate with my tastes.
