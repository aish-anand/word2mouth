after a night of wedding celebrating in the middle of nowhere beautiful lake and woods, much wilderness hubs and i grabbed lunch here before heading home to ca, we did not make a reservation so after ~mins wait we seated ourselves at the bar. the bartender was very friendly and took our order right away. we got scramble of the day with country potatoes and biscuit and chicken fried steak with mushroom, gravy, eggs and biscuit. both was really really good. the biscuitwhich came with whipped butter tasted homemade and not overly saltygreasy. my hubby's chicken fried steak was super delicious, the mushroom flavor was on point. my scramble was perfectly done, i only wish there were a little bit more, even though i felt stuffed after finishing everything. my side of country potato was very heavily spiced with some heat not my fave, but it complimented the light, fluffy scramble. at we were a bit comprehensive since we have been to a few of those places. how should i put it, hipster fusion-holier than thou-super organic-bougie.they are making 'farm to table' sound like a fad. where they serve over priced food that taste mediocre. local somehow got it right. it is too bad we live so far away otherwise this would be an awesome brunch, or lunch, or dinner spot.
