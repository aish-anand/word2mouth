san tung was extremely popular when i lived here about years ago and i am happy to report it is still as popular as ever. i came about mins before closing and i was afraid i would be at the tail end of service. little did i know, there is still a line! they are so packed all the time. the original dry fried chicken wings are as amazing as what everyone else has said. crunchy yet so much sauce and flavor. every bite is heavenly. i also ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings . i was a little disappointed in it to be honest. i almost thought they gave me the wrong order because i did not see any shrimp ! there was probably leek shrimp ratio. the dumplings were not terrible, just not what i had wanted.
