ordered chowder sampler, but as they put bacon in new england clam chowder had to limit only to seafood - base chowder seafood brisque and manhattan chowder . seafood brisque was creamy and yummy. but tomato-heavy manhattan chowder was off the mark, and had chewy clams . also ordered fried oyster poboy. the quantity of poboy for inches and quality was not good. i think this chowder place is good only for their namesake dish chowder . you get better and bigger sandwiches elsewhere.
