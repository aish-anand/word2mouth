i've been here times this summer and the food has been good every time. i've had the guacamole & chips, both types of sliders and the chicken chimichangas. the guacamole comes out fresh and delicious and the chips are nice and crispy. the sliders are little sliders that i have as a meal every time and they are perfect. the chimichangas were crisp on the outside and stuffed perfectly on the inside and topped with sour cream, guacamole and cheese. the service is always good, attentive host and waitresses and i've never had to wait for a table even when the place is packed during weekday lunch hour around pm . i have not had a problem walking the few blocks there and back on my lunch break and being back at work within an hour. the restaurant is nice inside and there is plenty of seating downstairs and upstairs and the prices are great for the area.
