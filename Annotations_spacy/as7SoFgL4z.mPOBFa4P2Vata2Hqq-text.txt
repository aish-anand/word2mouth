three michelin stars. in the world world's best, . we made our reservation months in advance for the gallery. after spending a small fortune ahead of time, we were more than intrigued to see if alinea would live up to the hype andor compare to other michelin restaurants of this caliber. pros newly renovated interior, still intimate yet simple. elements of surpriseshow. staff brad, miguel, everyone was amazing. attentive to allergies. experiencing the alinea kitchen very smart idea. drink pairings not mandatory for the whole table if one person opts for it. the iconic taffy helium balloon and grand finale dessert were everything we had anticipated, and more. seriously mindblown. the number of desserts in the tasting menuperfect for me as it is my favorite course. thai inspired dish outstanding. my one point of contention we had the pm seating. i personally felt as though the pace of the courses went very fast. by the end of the more savory courses, i felt overwhelmed as the food was quite decadent ie. black truffle mousse, caviar, lobster, more black truffle sandwich, wagyu beef, bone marrow, mushroom. i am surprised to read that anyone would leave alinea hungry because this to me seems impossible. the staff, however, were very gracious and we stayed for as long as we wanted.
