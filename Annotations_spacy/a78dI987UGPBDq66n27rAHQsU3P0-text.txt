i have now been to local for all meals. brunch, lunch, happy hour and dinner and i must say the food is pretty good. their happy hour is the best. you can get fresh taylor shellfish farm oysters for a dollar each during their happy hour. they also have a pretty good burger and great fries to go along with it. the fried gizzard are a must as well, super crispy and full of flavor. for dinner all of their beef preperations are near perfect. the rib eye with marrow butter is excellent. i seriously wish i could have a tub of that marrow butter. ughhhh soo good also if you see the crispy lamb breast you must get it my friend ordered the lamb and it was literally one of the most amazing lamb preperations i've had in awhile. juicy, crispy and super flavorful. i am definitely getting that next time i go. the fried chicken is okay.it is al little dry and i feel like the skin just is not crispy enough. i also feel like the lamb neck poutine has a very strange after taste, also a little too soggy for me. the ambiance is warm and cozy with soft lighting and candles everywhere. service is here is a hit or miss, sometimes when it is really busy it is not as good. i like the concept that everything is locally sourced miles from and around seattle. really great ingredients. good place for any meal.
