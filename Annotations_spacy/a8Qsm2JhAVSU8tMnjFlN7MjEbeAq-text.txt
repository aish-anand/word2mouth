the mega paitan is the way to go. comes with three varieties of pork so you can try them all! it will put you in a ramen coma. i was a bit apprehensive about trying it because i thought chicken broth would be a bit bland, but i'm glad they used chicken broth because otherwise, i think all that pork would have killed me. the shredded pork, garlic, and other garnishes make this broth extremely heavy in a good way , and i think you could easily split this bowl with someone else.the place itself is a very chic holeinthewall type place. it reminds me of ramen places in japan, but like, american hipsterfied. really cool place to grab dinner. beware of the wait i came early, but there was a bit of a line when i left.there is a place next door that seems to be the same restaurant, but with tonkatsu broth. i might give it a try next time i'm in the area.
