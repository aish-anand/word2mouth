might be my favorite restaurant in chicago. interior decorative, classy, and fun. service good. dishes are timed on point to make sure you enjoy each item sufficiently before the next dish is delivered so you are not swamped with dishes at the same time all out of order. roasted cauliflower pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint there is cheese. delicious, salted, savory, soft, and tastes like home. escargot ravioli bacon tamarind sauce, escarole & celery, crispy onions could not taste the escargot. resembled more like flattened dumplings in some broth. loved it. pan roasted halibut marcona almond butter, white asparagus . blueberry nuoc cham, beech mushroom fish sauce!! it was truly delicious and honored the vietnamese fish sauce taste without watering it down. must order. crisp braised pork shank buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion & radish kimch, naan pork falls off the bone. delicious, savory, soft. naan is decent but the pork is so good without it. lemon make you happy lemonÄã pound cake, sorrel ice cream, almond crunch, cheesecake sauce my husband hates lemon and pound cake but he ate it all. must order. the jam old forester bourbon, strawberry shrub, saison the perfect refreshing summer strawberry drink.
