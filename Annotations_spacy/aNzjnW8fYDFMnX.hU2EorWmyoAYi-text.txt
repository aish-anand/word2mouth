there is usually a long line at this place, but we got lucky and the wait time was not any longer than minutes to get our food and seated. i know this is a barbecue joint, but my favorite thing on their menu is not their ribs, or their briskets, or the pulled pork , it is their macaroni and cheese! they are so good, they were my two sides with the order. the ribs were good, just a bit on the dry side for me. briskets were good also. i did not like the sauces that came with the ribs, so i used tabasco sauce instead. they are a bit on the pricey side. i had the brisket platter, comes with coleslaw and sides. i also added of a slab. total was . i am not much of a ribs person, so i will be back next year, or when i am craving mac and cheese.
