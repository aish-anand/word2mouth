we went here for my boyfriends birthday. the place inside is like an oldies restaurant, and i loved it my boyfriend had steak since that is what they are known for, i cannot remember now which one he had, but let me tell you it was good. very good, and cut to perfection with a side of brocoli, the plate was so big, he could barely finish it. i ordered the alaskan king crab which i am happy i did. they were huge and so delish i had a side of potatoes and we were stuffed. of course we had to get desert, it was my bf bday. so we ordered the layer chocolate cake with vanilla icecream, all which again delish the cake was huge with this tiny candle on top the service was great, the drink was good. the prices are high, but it is one of those places you just have to try.
