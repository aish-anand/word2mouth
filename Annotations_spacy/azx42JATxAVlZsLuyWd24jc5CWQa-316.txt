my friend and i arrived at san tung on july about minutes before it opened. we opted to pay for meter parking since parking is scarce in sf. waiting in line in the cold, i was stoked to ry the famous wings and a few other recommended dishes thanks fellow yelpers. right at am, the doors opened and a full house was seated within minutes. protip come within that first wave of customers to avoid the wait. we ordered the following dishes based on popular reviews dry fried chicken these were supposed to be one of the best wings i will have in my life. i thought they were just slightly above average. maybe the hype was overbuilt for these wings some friends will load a carryon bag with wings to bring back to socal for friends as a souvenir gift from their travels mins north in a plane lol i thought they were just standard wings dressed in an asian sauce. what is so special about that t least the wings were not dry i suppose. shrimp and leek dumplings these came out cold in the middle as if they froze them and did not defrost the dumplings before cooking them. not a fan but props to them for not making the dumpling she will to doughy. black bean paste noodles drenched in black bean paste, i was not sure what i was eating aside from the sauce. wow i must be one of few who have such a bad experience there. i was so disappointed in the quality of the food but i will definitely give this place another try.
