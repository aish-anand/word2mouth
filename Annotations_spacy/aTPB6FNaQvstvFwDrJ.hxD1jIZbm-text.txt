finally got to try this famous ramen place. we arrived around on a weekday and waited about min.we ordered the char siu pork bun and mega pork ramen. the pork bun was unimpressive to me but the char siu was flavorful and tender. the mayo in the bun was a nice touch.the ramen was delicious and the egg was perfect. the wavy noodles were cooked just right. i did not like how much garlic there was though. there was garlic puree and fried garlic bits. it was too much for me but some people may love that.about halfway through my bowl, the ramen started tasting very heavy and salty. the soup felt almost too thick to drink. the cabbage helped a bit.cash only.
