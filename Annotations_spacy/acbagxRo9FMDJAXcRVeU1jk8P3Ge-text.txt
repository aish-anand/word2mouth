amazing french toast and gumbo toulouse has friendly service, and they were very accommodating even though we did not have a reservation. i tried the cured pork cheeks hash, which was pretty small and salty. i was underwhelmed by the dish that was raved about as the best thing i ever ate. however, i loved the crispy fried chicken gumbo the chicken was spicy, but paired very well with the gumbo. it was perfectly crispy and filling if you are craving sweets, definitely try the creme caramel french toast or try it even if you are not craving sweets the bread is so fluffy and eggy, and the sauce is bomb. my sister even ventured to say that it was the best french toast she is ever had. our plate was gone in minutes, leaving our tummies very happy. unlike the other places on queen anne, toulouse has a line that goes out the door, and it is well worth the wait they gave me a great pot of french press coffee to kickstart my day in seattle, and ended our brunch with fantastic french toast and doughy beignets
