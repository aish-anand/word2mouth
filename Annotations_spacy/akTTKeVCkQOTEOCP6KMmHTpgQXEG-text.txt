i dressed up pretty nicely for this place. just a floral dress and flats while my boyfriend did semi-formal with a button up and a sports coat. we were both a bit nervous about overdressing or not dressing up enough but when we got there, there was a variety of dress among the people. we were probably somewhere in the middle as there were a few guys in jeans, and some girls who wore maxi skirts or trousers. honestly, it would just depend on how comfortable you are with dressing up as the restaurant itself did not seem to mind or at least they did not say anything about those in jeans or way more under-dressed than the majority. we got to sit in a super comfy booth and the waiter was so awesome. he made a lot of jokes and was helpful when answering our questions and offering suggestions. for our meal, we ordered a calamari , candied bacon, an oz filet migon, and a oz of the ribeye. the calamari was excellent. it was not overly chewy or too salty. the candied bacon was honestly to die for. there are a lot of places i've had them at that were too much like jerky and much too tough. this one had the consistency of thick-cut bacon that was crispy on the outside yet chewy on the inside. it was sweet but not rot-your-teeth sweet. just what i was expecting. now for the main course. the steak was wonderful. i eat a lot of steak and honestly this was perfection. it was cooked with just the right amount of pink i asked for, and was sooooo juicy. it was really well seasoned and honestly, the baby carrots that came with it were superb as well. my boyfriend's steak was huuuuge and he probably was only able to finish it all because of how good it was. overall, i'm so glad we dressed up and were able to experience this place in all of it is glory. i will definitely come back one of these days.
