well worth the wait and hype! get on the waiting list via yelp before arriving. normal lunch wait for two is . hrs! ok with that out of the way, the bf and i came here for lunch. on our way over we joined the wait list via yelp, wait time? hr minutes, holy... took us minutes to get there, squeezed past the crowds to check in, and the hostess told us they will text when ready. luckily, you have the beautiful millennium park across the street to sight see, play tourist, work up an appetite, and kill time. text came in which gave me minutes to get to the front. little did they know, i was already there. lol checked in once again and stood there waiting to be seated more parties ahead but all got seated quickly. service is fast, there are many servers, bus boys, and hostess. workers are very efficient and good at their job, which keeps the patrons flowing. now to the juicy part, the food corned beef hash skillet stars! the corned beef is homemade. comes with hash browns or fruit, toast or pancakes but sub with the berry bliss waffle but well worth it bc a seperate waffle order will cost you . the corned beef hash was so deliciously flavored, tender, minced, and yet still had a little crunch factor from the mixed in hash. berry bliss waffle + stars, this dish beats most waffles i have ever eaten. i was very full after finishing my benedicts, but knew i needed to try this beautiful waffle. i ended up eating half the waffle and wanted to order more regardless of how full i was. my boyfriend talked some sense into me and i sadly agreed. . florence benedict stars, loaded with spinach and bacon bites, topped with a perfectly poached egg, and dressed with a very nice, creamy hollandaise sauce with a hint of lemon. double espressostrong and flavorful orange juice freshly squeezed!
