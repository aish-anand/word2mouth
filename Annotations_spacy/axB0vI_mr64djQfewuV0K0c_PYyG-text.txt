came across this place on yelp and saw it had many reviews and the name was pretty cute so we decided to come for dinner. our friend said this place was good but quite pricey but we still wanted to give it a try. there were plenty of seating outside and inside. so we chose to sit inside. we decided to order the roasted bone marrow , cavatelli pasta , milk braised pork shoulder , and selection of the brigante al tartufo cheese platter . the roasted bone marrow was probably the best dish that we ordered. it was recommended by our friend and definitely enjoyed it. it came with some baguettes and arugula. the pasta was probably the most unexpected dish. it was basically ravioli wrapped with a goat cheese filling. the goat cheese was overpowering and extremely creamy. it was definitely one of the worst dish that we had. the pork shoulder also took forever to come out. we were done with our dishes and the pork shoulder was still not out yet. the pork was alright. it was a bit dried but paired with the mashed potatoes, it was manageable. lastly, the cheese platter was great! the cheese was light and refreshing. it came with some cracker bites and jelly. the combination was to die for! overall, i would recommend the bone marrow and the cheese platter. the pasta was the worst dish we had. and the pork shoulder was just alright. we were looking forward to our experience here and it just did not meet our expectations. our waiter also was not very nice. he seemed too cool to answer our questions and seemed to smirk a lot when taking our order.
