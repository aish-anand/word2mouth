the best traditional steak house in seattle. i use that word because of the familiar menu offerings, old-school decor and vibe, and uniformed waitstaff. for steak overall i still prefer bateau, but this is a great spot. i sampled the crab cakes, prime rib , and brussel sprouts. the crab cakes were phenomenal and had different types of crab inside. the prime rib was good, but was surprisingly overshadowed by the roasted root vegetable sides sweet potato, carrot, parsnip that came with it. i was underwhelmed by the brussels after failing to convince my dining companion to get the creamed spinach. the desserts looked delicious, but massive. we saw a slice of the carrot cake that looked like a day's worth of food. may return just to try the cake.
