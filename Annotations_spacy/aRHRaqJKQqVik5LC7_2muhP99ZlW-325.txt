i finally got to try this place after a couple of failed attempts. i came here twice before but they were closed. when i arrived, there was about an hour long wait and i was not about to wait that long, so i just ordered for take out. black bean noodles actually tasted like the korean chinese version. of all the places that i've tried in la, it was probably the best that i've tried so far. original dry chicken wings had a good balance of savory and sweet so it was pretty dang delicious. i can see why everyone who comes here orders this. i do not know why it says dry because it is not dry . it is a bit saucy.
