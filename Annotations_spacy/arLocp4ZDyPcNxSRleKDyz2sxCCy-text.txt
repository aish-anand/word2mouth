i was so excited to try luke's lobster. i've heard only great things lobster is fresh, great selection, cool environment.when i walked in, i scanned the menu written on a black board on the wall . seemed like a good varietyrolls, grilled cheese, yum. after ordering, my food was ready in less than a minute i ordered the lobster roll combocomes with chips or slaw and a drink . the roll looked pretty good. the bread was nice and toasted, lobster was cold and had some type of seasoning sprinkled on top.first bite was okay lobster was a little bland. when i started to go in for my second bite, i noticed there were some weird milkycolored chunks of something.at first i thought it was a vegetable but after taking a bite of one it had a consistence like a super overcooked vegetable. i shrugged it off and picked those pieces out of the roll. next two bites had big pieces of lobster she will.not so fun to have to pick those out of my mouth. another bite had sand! totally turned me off and i could not continue eating the roll. i was so bummed because i heard such great things, and saw great reviews here on yelp.the slaw was okay.had a nice vinegary flavor. they have a great selection of sodai tried the blueberry honey lemonade, which i really enjoyed.i am not the type to be super picky about casual food, but the sand, she will, and mysterious milky white chunks were just not acceptable.overall i would not recommend this location, but am going to try another luke's lobster.
