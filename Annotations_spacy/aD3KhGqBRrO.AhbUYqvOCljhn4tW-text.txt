decided to stop by here for a super early dinner on saturday right after they opened. it was a good idea to come early since we were able to grab seats at the bar non bar seatings are reservation only!. the place was also packed when we were leaving. the service here was amazing throughout the meal. the interior of the place was super classy and bright. goat carpaccio super well made dish. i love how there were salmon roe on top of the carpaccio that gave it a nice savory touch with the fish oil. great appetizer to start. braised beef tongue extremely tender meat and i only wish there was more! the flavor also the salsa verde went really well with the greens and meat. calamari bruschetta the grilled calamari was so fresh and delicious. the bruschetta was a bit too heavy for my taste and one of the bread was kind of stale. overall a great meal. apparently you can do half orders for some dishes? but i would definitely double check.
