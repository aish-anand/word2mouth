having been to toulouse petit for brunch, lunch and late night happy hour, i feel that it is high time to share a review. the excellent reviews brought me here for brunch for the first time years ago, and the consistently delicious food and extensive happy hour offerings keep me coming back even with half-hour waits during prime weekend brunch hours and jam-packed happy hours. this place is nearly always poppin' highlights - duck confit hash and cured pork cheeks confit hash as a lover of breakfast hashes, duck, and anything with the word confit in it, i had to try both of these dishes. they seem to be the exact same - both featuring an innovative combination of cubed potato, parsnip and apple - except for the meats. the pork cheeks are extra tender, but both dishes are solid. - creme caramel french toast soft, fluffy, moist, decadent with caramel sauce and fresh strawberries. my friends the french toast aficionados love this dish. only tilth's golden raisin-sprinkled french toast squares could rival toulouse's, but it is a draw as to whose is better. other dishes - toulouse beignets yummy small triangles of fried donut with plenty of powdered sugar and coffee dipping sauce. i still like cafe du monde's piping-hot beignets best, but these are a pretty good stand-in, especially if you like coffee. - fried chicken gumbo excited to order as i love fried chicken, ok, not amazing. - shrimp and grits my friend enjoyed the sauciness of the shrimp and creaminess of the grits. - yellow beets and haricots vert ok. - buttermilk fried chicken bites pretty good. - beef sliders pretty good. - fried green tomatoes pretty good. this restaurant, with its southern decor, wide assortment of great food, mix of booth and bar seating, and breakfastregularlate night happy hours, knows how to run a thriving business.
