been here several times for happy hour and dinner and have always been happy with the food, drinks and service. hhs are awesome here - there is a reason why it is in the top ten. have had beet salad - very yummy, from someone who recoils at the thought of beets cauliflower soup with dungeness crab - very good, even though i'm not even a big fan of cream-based soups manila clams with spanish chorizo - a wonky combination of flavors, but for someone who likes both clams and chorizo, i loved it sinister shrimp and bbq shrimp any of the sliders . but really, people - why come to this place for sliders the cocktails are also incredible and the service very good. we have also never had any problems finding parking, despite the fact that it is lower queen anne. wish this was closer to my 'hood - would love to be able to walk here for a quick bite more often
