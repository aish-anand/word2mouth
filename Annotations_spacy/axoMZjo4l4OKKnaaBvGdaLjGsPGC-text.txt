this place is super popular. i went at lunchtime on the weekend and there were two lines out the door. it took at least minutes to get to order. i went with the chowder sampler - seafood bisque , new england clam chowder, market chowder crab, lobster, and sweet corn, and seared scallop chowder. for for oz., it is quite a hefty price to pay. so, i would hope that it was some stellar chowder. well, it was good chowder, but not the best i've ever had. the seafood bisque did not have enough seafood taste in it. the market chowder, seared scallop chowder, and new england chowder all tasted pretty much the same. if it were not for the different meats in them, i would not be able to tell the difference to what i was eating. ultimately, in my opinion, it is overhyped but, if you are crazy about chowder, then give it a try.
