went here on a date because my date saw it on john wick. when we got here we read up on the history of the restaurant & how it was the first fine dining establishment in america.we both extremely enjoyed the atmosphere & definitely had the best fine dining experience thanks to the helpful staff.my date ordered the signature delmonico's steak and i ordered the lamb chops. we had a started of west coast oysters then for our side orders we had mash potatoes and asparagus. i can for the first time say when i tasted the lamb chops and steak, i cried. i cried tears of joy because it was absolutely the most delicious meat to ever hit my tastebuds. however, the most surprising thing was the simple mashed potatoes and asparagus being absolutely perfected. lastly, the west coast oysters came with three different sauces to try them with and i can happily say i enjoyed every slurp.i would absolutely recommend taking anyone here to have the best full experience of fine dining.
