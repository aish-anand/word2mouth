I think the experience at Lowell's can vary significantly depending on whether you go for breakfast/brunch versus lunch or dinner, if you're going at peak tourist summer season versus other times of the year, and whether you're able to grab a window seat. I imagine it's chaos during the summer! The hubby and I have been here during the fall/winter without the overwhelming crowds and really liked their food--it's not cheap for a casual place, but the seafood quality is there. The fish and chips, blackened grilled salmon, dungeness crab cakes, tiger prawns, and cole slaw are all worth their weight in dollars. The seafood is fresh, and being in the market helps with the quality of their ingredients. I will concede, however, that their clam chowder is good but not a slam dunk. We've never been here for breakfast, so can't comment on that menu. First and third floors are self-serve seating, the second floor is traditional dine-in service. We like self service, so never have been to the restaurant section. Employees here are friendly, although we've also never tried snagging a table before ordering. I hear they're veddy, veddy strict on that.
