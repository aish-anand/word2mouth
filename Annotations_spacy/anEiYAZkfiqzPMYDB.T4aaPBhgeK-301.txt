best chinese food in norcal, maybe anywhere. the home made kim chee is the best, then have shrimp and leek dumplings , pork dumplings , or pot stickers. you have never had better. they are home made fillings and noodles. be careful, you have them once and you will have to have them at least once a week! every dish is so flavorful and distinctly different. the yellow curries are awesome. kung pao is amazing. try the black bean homemade noodles or any noodles. chicken wings, garlic chicken, mao pao, dry fried string beans, mu shu, and everything is so special. very crowded for obvious reasons. sometimes the line is down the street. dress warm and bring a beverage to drink while waiting for a table on a friday or saturday night. you will never eat chinese food in san francisco anywhere else again. it is that good!!!! try san tung next door also. that is how good this food is, that they are able to have a second one next door. are you getting it! thank you to the chu family for making eating a heavenly experience! did i mention the sauces are the best in the world! mike mcnair
