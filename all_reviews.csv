1,Alex K.,1118,3,10/30/18,"this dosa location has a very romantic, upscale feel to it that is perfect for date night. unfortunately, i do not find their food to reflect the upscale vibe or price tag associated with it. we appreciated their listing of allergens on the menu but still felt a bit disappointed that only one curry larger entree could be made vegan. we ordered vegan chutney sampler . the variety of five chutneys was good, but i did not find them alone to be worth the price. vegan channa bhatura curry the highlight of the meal, this curry was nuanced, fresh and delicious. it was small for , though. vegan mixed chile uttapam super spicy, and my girlfriend and i can almost always handle the kick. the menu did say spicy! but i think this warranted a bit more warning than that. regardless, this was tasty, but i did not think it was worth . and i know, i'm getting repetitive. the soup that accompanied the uttapam was, however, super delicious. overall, my girlfriend and i enjoyed our meal but the warm ambiance and friendliness of our server could not make up for the seemingly unwarranted cost of our dinner. i do not think i will find myself returning, since we left a bit unsatisfied and ultimately, still hungry."
2,Alison W.,1118,4,10/11/18,"i would never had south indian cuisine or dosas before. but some indian friends recommended this place and i'm always up for trying something new. we had kinda a large group so we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. though we sat around for about minutes after we arrived, while they were setting up our table. we got a bunch of appetizers samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. the idli fries are bomb. they were like right out of the fryer hot. not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. and it comes with a unique dipping sauce. the chutney sampler came with chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive and complementary papad kinda like indian chips . i could have just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you cannot have just one. samosas were ok nothing out of the ordinary. then the rest of us got some kind of dosa. i actually tried the uttapam sampler. uttapam is like a thicker dosa. i could not tell you all the different types of the uttapam but i enjoyed all five of them. all were vegetarian though and some had cheese that i remember. i also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa. the dosa itself is huge and crepelike and i like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce. i think i also got to try the bhatura, which is like the puffed crepe or flat bread. i think i liked it more than the paper dos, bc it had a bit more of a sweet flavor. everything i had was really good and thanks to our friends for showing this type of cuisine. i will definitely need to search out more southern indian cuisines."
3,Avantika A.,1118,5,10/8/18,"loved the chilli uttapam ! as someone who hails from south india, i can say that this place is legit"
4,Ramya R.,1118,3,9/27/18,"this restaurant has a beautiful ambience but the food is just above average,nothing really extraordinarybeing a south indian i can cook the same food. the dishes are quite expensive and portion size is less for the price. we had masala chai,chille masala dosa,five moon uttapam and idly fry,which was all included. service was quick and servers were friendly."
5,N N.,1118,3,9/25/18,"tried this place for lunch last weekend. had heard so much about this place, so finally decided to give it a try. this place has great ambience, but sadly, the food did not live up to the hype. being a south indian myself, i was really excited about this place. we ordered the pani puri shots for appetizers, and we got puris with pani served in shot glasses. the puri tasted fresh and crispy, however we felt it was over priced for just puri's . it is also quite rare that you find only puri's per serving of pani puri. for the main course, i ordered a chicken thalli and my husband ordered the rava dosa. the rava dosa was good. it was with good serving of sambar, which i was happy with, although nothing extraordinary. the chicken thalli came with small servings of salads , chk fry, chk curry, channa, sambar, rasam, raita, curd, uttapam , lemon rice and white rice. all of which were average. nothing bad, but would not really go back. we live in san jose and there are numerous options for great south indian food for th the price. so if you are one of them, do not waste your time."
6,Sujit D.,1118,4,8/13/18,"although the name of the restaurant suggests focus on south indian cuisine, this classy joint serves variety of fusion snacks and meals east meets west. we enjoyed kerala chicken, south indian moons baby uttapams , dahi wada, south indian monsoon a non alchoholic cocktail drink, mango lassi and masala dosa all very good. staff are very friendly. service is fast for standard items masala dosa but makes you wait for nonstandard ones e.g. south indian moons . on a saturday afternoon there was no wait time to be seated for lunch. although, when visiting this place for dinner we did experience minutes wait times on weekends. the ambience is nice spacious airy and colorful. the tables are placed too close to each other for comfort. overall a nice place."
7,Andrew S.,1118,4,8/4/18,"this is the iconic south indian restaurant in san francisco. a group of us had a fantastic dinner experience here one saturday night. we shared a bunch of plates lamb dosa, rava masala, uttapams , chicken curry, goat belly and tapioca kheer. everyone had a nice cup of chai with dinner as well. the goat belly honey and pepper roasted was definitely the best part of the meal. it was a real treat and we got the last order that night. other items were also quite good i would reorder that chicken curry and lamb dosa any day. the ambiance inside the restaurant is nice. i particularly liked the high ceilings and the abundance of natural light. service was really good and the food came out really fast. relatively inexpensive for a fine dining experience including tax and tip, this was about per person. highly recommend this place for those looking for an indian feast. definitely more fun with a group."
8,Mithun D.,1118,5,7/27/18,"i took my wife on a surprise date. glad i did.we had lamb shack along with uttapam . lamb shack was delicious. uttapam and different variety of chutnies all were mouth watering. we also had pomegranate juice and mixed fruit drink with ginger, mango, pomegranate.we had mini laddu desert. all orders were delicious.please make prior reservations which i did. the place is pretty packed."
9,Zachary F.,1118,5,7/9/18,"great food, awesome ambience, reasonable pricing, we had the uttapam moons as a starter the homemade fruit fruit shrubs were amazing. this is an absolute favorite to share with friends."
10,garbanzo b.,1118,4,6/11/18,"good food, great ambience, reasonable pricing we had the uttapam moons as a starter to get our appetite wet for the true star of the show the masala dosa!"
11,Chintan D.,1118,4,5/29/18,very nice place and ambience for an indian restaurant. the dosas and uttapam were amazing. vada pav was best in bay area.
12,Cat T.,1118,3,5/19/18,"overhyped type of place. coming to visit sf to see friends in town. two friends that live their mentioned dosa to me. the food did not have very distinct flavors. i felt like the dosa, uttampams and the curry all generally taste the same. we order the paneer & peas dosa, roasted chile & garlic dosa, brokaw avocado chaat, philipkutty chicken curry, and the south indian moons different uttapams . out of everything, i would say the curry was maybe the best thing but that was pretty typical but at least the chicken was tender. the overall restaurant is very nice and fancy but food was subpar. recommend to try just once. best to get reservation on weekend nights."
13,Dhaval M.,1118,5,5/16/18,awesome place with superb ambience! it provides a fine dine experience and suitable for dinner dates and celebrations. the food presentation is great. they have customized lot of indian dishes in a unique way to present it well but keeping the authenticity of the taste. i've tried few dishes and all of them from dosas to uttapam turned out great. of course it is a bit expensive but that is what you pay for such an ambience in sf. the servers are very kind. not recommended to walkin without reservation.
14,Abhishek C.,1118,1,5/14/18,"visited the dosa with family as it came with a glowing recommendation and a rating on yelp. but boy, were we in for a rude shock! landing at the place with a prior reservation, we were welcomed by a big heavy door and a sizeable eating joint designed at two levels. little did i realise that it was the only big thing that we were going to be experiencing in the restaurant that night besides the final cheque of course which was already expected we immediately realised after talking to the hostess that they had forgotten to reserve a table for us yelp . they tried to turn it around with a tiny corner table on the upper level which could have seated kids maybe! after a few minutes of contemplation, maybe the staff realised we were definitely not going to sit in each other's laps and the guests on the adjacent table sportingly moved to make more space for us. the real horror started then with our server for the day, brittany c. now when a restaurant decides to charge you a % service markup automatically just because you are group of or more, the least that you expect is a decent service! but brittany came in with a tiny heart and grumpy attitude and seemed more in a mood as if we were there to eat for free! after a very offending introduction to a set menu or the preferable ala carte menu , we placed our orders without any recommendations being offered by her despite telling that it was our first visit. we ordered the rava dosa, egg dosa, chile uttapam and goat biryani along with a rasam the complimentary pappadums never came out even though the meal came pretty quickly. we had to explicitly ask for them before they turned up. now the dosa and uttapam were served with a moderate sized bowl of sambhar and tiny portions of chutneys. anyway knowing anything about south indian food may please enlighten me how to eat a dosa with a few spoons of sambhar and a teas oonful of chutney the food was served very rudely and when we asked if we could get more chutney, we got a condescending answer of it will cost you . when we have our consent another server brought it out and it was shockingly just another teaspoonful! we asked the new server if this is what we get in , he got confused and said he will be right back after checking but it never happened! now in this entire episode the food is not anything great to write about. it is not bad but it is definitely not worth a for someone who knows how south indian tastes like. the goat biryani is definitely not a recommendation at all!! coming back to the service, we never got any water refills and noone checked on how we were liking the food. at the end of it we left most of the goat biryani but brittany just brought out the cheque and did not even care to ask why the biryani was left over. for the biryani we asked for a take away box thought we could give it to someone needy but brittany just brought the box and placed it rudely in front of us without a word or smile after all this, we decided that the service did not deserve a % charge and we called in the manager who came in with a fake smile and concern. the manager heard our entire ordeal and said she will fix the bill and offered free desserts. we told her very clearly we did not want free stuff but also did not want to pay for a service we did not get and just wanted the charge removed. but she insisted that as it was mother's day she would want us to have desserts so we agreed. and then she crumpled the old bill right in front of us, do not know if that was really required to be done! in comes brittany with the dessert oh the horror!! . she placed one dessert in front of us rudely she could have dropped it on our head if she could have had her way and made a statement you talked to my manager, your bill will come in soon and just walked away. and then she comes back with another one and leaves with a statement hope the free desserts make up for your concerns . hello why the hell do people think that customers complain to get free stuff oh and she did come in again to offer chai or coffee which she said was on her. well dear brittany, after the experience i would not even had water if it was on you coming from india, i always thought america offers a different standard of service to customers. but dear dosa management, believe me i realise now that tiny hearts and money minded businesses are incapable of offering anything more than a product. please keep your free stuff to yourself, if you can offer anything do offer some warmth in your cold little place! to mr anjan thanks for your revert but it just reaffirms your attitude towards the whole incident! we are not looking for your free stuff so please keep the offer to yourself. would have been happier to see your revert say we would offer impeccable and warm service!"
15,Clare L.,1118,3,5/5/18,"my boyfriend and i think this place was alright. it is more like an indian fusion restaurant than an authentic southern indian place. if we ever crave for dosa again, we probably will go somewhere else. on the day of our visit, the majority of the dishes offered on the menu were vegetarian. though the restaurant was not full, we waited for a long time before the staff came to take our order. for the dosa, we ordered the classic masala dosa . there were three complementary sauces and they were all pretty decent. they were more on the sour side. the dosa came really fast and the crepe itself was thin and crisp. pretty good. we also ordered mixed mushroom uttapam . this dish was really meh. it felt like a simple pizza on an indian dough. uttapam was kinda sour and there was quite a lot of cheese on the dish. the complementary sauces were the same as the dosa's. the dish was fairly bland and also soggy. we could not manage to finish this. our last dish was the goat dum biryani. this was probably our favorite dish out of the three we ordered. the goat biryani was sitting inside a naanbread like bowl and there was a yogurtlike complementary sauce. the biryani was well flavored and decently spicy. we really loved the goat super juicy, soft and wellseasoned. it is a decent indian restaurant but with how much it is charging you, i probably will not revisit again."
16,Shireen K.,1118,3,4/24/18,"the masala dosa was tasty however there was a very small portion of the actual potatoes in the center. we also ordered the chefs choice uttapam which did not give us a bang for our buck, the five pieces were tiny and basically served as one biters almost. if i had to reorder i would go with a regular uttapam rather than a traditional dosa or the chefs choice. the raita we ordered on the side was as expected but again the portion was rd the serving bowl. in summary the food was average good but the portions were very small giving the impression of corners being cut."
17,Tiffany H.,1118,4,3/14/18,"yums! i really enjoyed the masala dosa dish i ordered, but i think the food here is quite pricey. i've been told by my brown companion that dosa is overpriced and overhyped and to not go here , but i still had to give it a try. the potato was quite creamy, and the dosa was light and crispy. i liked the sauces to dip the dosa in it was not super spicy for me, but it can be, especially if you are not used to the heat. the sambar lentil and vegetable dipping soup was good as well. i tried a bite of my friend's uttapam south indian moons featuring different types of uttapam , and while it was good, it was not utterly amazing. the service here is very friendly, as one would expect for a restaurant of this quality. the meal overall was not too heavy, and i liked the fact that i felt pretty light and clean afterwards."
18,Adrienne K.,1118,5,3/2/18,"really good indian food in the fillmore. this is southern indian cuisine, so not what we are used to in the states no tandoor, no naan . with that being said, the breads are absolutely delicious, as are the various toppings, fillings, and curries. would highly recommend the butternut squash and paneer uttapam and the vegan curry that comes with the poori. service was efficient and friendly. cocktails looked interesting, but i did not partake."
19,Angela C.,1118,4,3/1/18,"when you mention that you are going to dosa and someone asks you to order takeout for lunch the next day, you know you are going somewhere good. that was the prehype i experienced about dosa, when me and my friend announced our intent to grab a late night dinner there. was the guy who said that right about just how good the food was eh. it was good, but not something i would look forward to eating day old like him. we snuck into the restaurant right before closing. still, our waiter was very courteous even though we stayed past official hours. the decor of the restaurant is classy and is definitely a hip, upscale place. for food, i opted to try the south indian moons the chef's selection of five different uttapams . i really appreciate when a restaurant has the option to sample different dishes! they were all pretty good, but i think my main issue was that i could not tell them apart. maybe i should have gotten a dosa after all, that is the name of the restaurant. i think for the price and experience i'm willing to come back and try it again. the service and ambiance impressive, i hope next time to find a dish i fall in love with."
20,Ro C.,1118,4,2/19/18,"been here a few times. dosa always good. coconut chutney could be better but the other accompaniments are good. spicy uttapam good, no joke on the spice, highest tolerance needed. spicy avocado chaat meh. it is basically just avocado in some watery spice mixture, with an odd mix of grapefruit pieces on top and very minimal crispy shavings. nothing like a traditional chaat if that is what you are thinking. vada pav good, some zest. mint lemonade good. ambiance good. seem to usually be busy even at notbusy hours, or at least they say they cannot open a table at even though you can see empty tables."
21,David Y.,1118,4,3/5/18,"most of the dishes we ordered at dosa were quite good. really enjoyed the dosa and the idly fries, which were full of so many diverse flavors. the paper dosa was awesome i.e. literally, aweinducing due to the portion size . as soon as it was served, i realized we had ordered simply too much food. the paper dosa could probably feed a party of four comfortably. after the dosa, our entrees came the prawn masala and duck . i was not a big fan of the duck dish but the prawn masala was explosive in flavors. great location with a beautiful interior, would definitely come back to try out some of the other items on the menu!"
22,Sebastian F.,1118,4,2/26/18,"i live in the neighborhood for a few years now and cannot believe i have not been to dosa! upscale indian food in a super vibrant setting rezzies highly recommended, and be prepared to pay more than the usual sf prices for your food. what you get in return however is amazing great presentation, fast and friendly service, and boozy drinks from the bar. i was impressed with the lamb kema dosa a rice and lentil crepe with spiced minced lamb , less impressed with the chutney sampler . , pretty small , but then again impressed with the prawn masala . love the atmosphere and the food, and the prices. oh well."
23,Jennifer M.,1118,4,2/8/18,pricey for elevated indian food but really good. i'm coming back again for sure. for a teeny bit of brussel sprouts tastes good but not worth getting that. avoid though they recommend. paper dosa yuuuuuuuuuge. very good. liked the masala dosa dipped in a mix of the warm sambar sauce with the spicy tomato chutney. did not like the spicy green coconut chutney. prawn masala grilled over a bed of firm coconut rice surrounded by coconut tomato curry. had a nice bit of spiciness. i do not like coconut curries but i loved this. came with largeish deshelled but tailon shrimp. cocktails interesting flavors and tasty but very light on alcohol for being +
24,Kim B.,1118,1,12/18/17,"honestly, this used to be my absolute favorite restaurant for years in san francisco. i moved away to co about two years ago, and came back recently to dine there, and it was the worst indian food i've ever had. i asked the waitress why everything was so different, and she said they recently had some menu changes. i could not be more depressed about this. i ordered the idli fries as an appetizer, which were unimpressive and the prawn masala as my entree. the curry to the prawn masala tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry. my mom ordered a chicken curry, which also had a watery consistency, and no flavor. this is one of the pricier indian restaurants, and i had always felt it was worth it perviously, but if you are thinking of going there now, i would advise you to save your money."
25,Dan W.,1118,4,12/11/17,"dosa delivers big flavors and great textures. the dosa itself is worth coming back for. highlights dosa masala prawn masala kerala fried chicken also tried the dahi vada while good and creamy, there was so much lemon juice it was borderline offensive."
26,A K.,1118,5,11/12/17,"worth the hype and the money! excellent service, and very good selection in the menu. cannot go wrong with anything. do try the lamb keema dosa, the fried chicken and the prawn masala . parking may be a hassle, but hey this is sf!"
27,Aaron B.,1118,5,8/17/17,"dosa on fillmore is pretty rad. the space is huge which is always a treat in sf. we made a reservation on yelp and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. they have a really great cocktail selection and looks like they regularly rotate out new drinks. i forget what i had but it was spicy and unique. my first thought was what is a dosa they are basically giant indian tacos but a little more sophisticated. first off, they are huge. they are veggies and meat wrapped in delicious bread. we got one or two as an app and it was great. we got some other apps as well but the must have one is the giant puffy bread. it is literally fried dough the size of a basketball and filled with air. it tasted great and was fun to eat. for the main dish i got the prawn masala . i love all things coconut milk and seafood. it was exactly what i wanted. you do not get a ton of food here like most indian place. for it was perfect for one person but i did not have any leftovers. this was my first upscale indian experience and i loved it."
28,Chloe M.,1118,4,2/28/17,"another great neighborhood goto! i have never made a reservation at dosa, but am thinking we should start. every time we have gone, we have gone at prime dinner time pm pm and have seen a long wait. every time, we have miraculously found a spot at the bar or been seated at a table in record time. lucky, i guess! i am not a huge fan of eating at the bar here, as it is busy and noisy. i'm paying the same for the meal, i would prefer the full experience. sitting at a table is lovely and service at both table and bar is top notch. now for the food boyfriend always gets a dosa and loves them! i've been a fan of dosas, but for whatever reason i do not dig dosa's dosas. so i've experimented. one time, i got a mango salad with some sea tuber that was inedible it was so salty. another time, i got scallops eh . once, i just ordered bread. last time, i got the prawn masala which was great. i finally found my dish. one thing never changes i always order the bhatura. oh. my. sweet. jesus. i love this bread so much. when it comes out, it is a huge puff the size of your head. everyone stares. worth it. it is like low key fried dough. i could eat that bread every day and do every time we go to dosa . huge highlight even when my main dish is not to die for. overall, love this place. great upscale ambiance, great place to bring visitors. again, would recommend a reservation. also, without fail, we are always surprised by the bill. both food and drink are a little spendy for weeknight indian, but we keep coming back!"
29,Claudia M.,1118,4,1/29/17,"one of the best dining experiences i've had! took advantage of the restaurant week deal. starters, dosas or curries, and deserts. the flavors were superb and the service was good. ambiance feels a bit upscale yet still causal. serving sizes are on the small side but the taste of everything i tried made up for it all. i will definitely be back. here's what we ordered starters beet croquettes chennai chicken lemon chile scallops dosas lamb keema dosa mixed mushroom & truffle oil uttapam goan prawn masala w rice deserts rasmalai pistachio barfi i was not a fan of the deserts much but that is mostly because i do not have much of a sweet tooth. my sister did enjoy them though! i would eat everything again. cannot wait to try more of their menu."
30,Liz C.,1118,5,1/27/17,"i had been meaning to make it to dosa for a while now i finally paid a visit on a friday evening during sf's restaurant week. when you walk in, you notice how beautiful the space is. the whole ambiance of the place is indeed trendy, as yelp would put it. not an authentically indian vibe, but still very appealing. a little too dimly lit for me, perhaps also an oddly desirable music playlist indie electronic hits either way, seemed like a great place to be for dinner and drinks at the end of welldeserved week. my party of decided to go for the prix fix menu featured as part of their restaurant week menu, but also something that they offer on the regular . each plate was phenomenal and mindfully prepared. some standouts for me were the sprouted mung and paneer salad, goan prawn masala , and the classic masala dosa the chef was also nice enough to give us an additional sweet potato dosa to accommodate the of us . the curries were spicy even for me, but i love me a good spicy dish so no complaints from me although that could be an area of concern for many others. service was okay, found my server to be somewhat aloof and a little confused as well, but you cannot have it all, right "
31,Edna C.,1118,4,1/26/17,"a fancy indian place in japantown given sf's trends of overpriced food, i was a skeptic but got lured by restaurant week, when i found dosa to be the only place with a worthwhile menu. while most other restaurants feature the anticlimatic addition of a salad and a brownie for a course meal, dosa became an adventurous feast through spices and creative cooking. small plates] ++ chips you start off with complimentary chips, and it is unlike anything i've ever eaten before. it is light, crispy, and has a handful of seeds thrown in. ++ chennai chicken the expertly roasted chicken maintains a savory juiciness while imparting strong smokey tones, contrasting boldly with the cool cucumber and yogurt sauce. ++ sprouted mung & paneer salad the varied landscape of flavors was noteworthy, but the texture was truly outstanding. this dish deserves some mindful eating to fully appreciate how the chewy coconut, crunchy pomegranate, and springy arugula simultaneously influence the sprouted mung bean, which ends up tasting more crispy or soft depending on what ends up in that particular forkful. the paneer is interestingly akin to tofu, and i enjoyed the pure taste in contrast to the more pungent versions i usually see. ++ beet croquettes the sophisticated take pulls off a vegetablebased, creamfree, extra creamy croquettes. not only does the blend of several vegetables create a palatable base the incorporation of spices, nuts, curry, and a cranberry chutney adds extra layers of complexity. curries etc.] +++ nagai vegetable korma i chose this somewhat as a chore so we could eat our veggies, knowing that vegetable dishes typically pales next to meat dishes even at state bird! but we even the boo who is usually carnivorous were blown away. the perfect spice blends of ageold south indian cuisine combined with novelty vegetables like marble potatoes and romanesco creates a dish that looks modest but synergistically showcases the magic of fresh produce and ethnic cooking. how californian + goan prawn masala i was unimpressed by the portion size of one shrimp per person, and that these were standardsized shrimp and not prawns . the marsala is constructed from distinctly fresh ingredients, but was dominated by the fiery spiciness. +++ roasted masala lamb shank in an era when fine dining consists of abstractly small portions, this ginormous leg of a lamb was a surprise and well worth the extra charge. the hour slow braising resulted in falloffthebone tender and had a similar pervasively roasty flavors to the chennai chicken excellent savory dish in itself, but exacerbates the spiciness of the prawn masala . the mix of spices with the vegetablebased seasoning added subtlety, and the lamb paired well with the fragrant lemon herb rice. dessert] + sweet cheese patties not sure if my expectations had just built up too high over the meal or if the dessert is too advanced for me, but despite the intrigue of rose water i think this was my least favorite. the cheese itself had a limp texture and tasted in between savory cheese and dessert, and the conglomerate of cream nut cardamom floral added to the confusion for me. + pistachio barfi as a whole it tasted like an artisan dark chocolate however it was too sugary, which overshadowed any fascinations from cashew milk and hibiscus. dranks] ++ mango lassi good mango flavor, easy to drink and not too thick. with the tagline urban south indian dining with a californian sensibility , dosa exemplifies the unique and delicious globallocal theme that takes the fusion concept to the next level. presentation is onpoint instagramworthy for the most partfrom the giant fluffy channa bhatura bread that always catches your eye as it passes by your table, to the fine diningesque display of beet croquettes on a wooden board with a magenta smear. i actually like how there is also a mix of more plain presentation, such as the vegetable korma in the traditional indian bowl, which tones down any pretentiousness. ambiance is swanky, with extremely dim lighting if good food pictures are a priority, i strongly recommend coming for a sunny brunch instead . the tall ceilings with a half second level and bar along one side reminds me of nopa. although service was friendly, i must say my main gripe overall was the slowness we arrived at and left at o.o which meant extra needed for parking they only validate ironically, the server checked in with us several times to ask if our round of apps entrees had arrived, and our answer was that none or only one had come. she also took forever on the mango lassi when boo was breathing fire from the spiciness. pro tip although the menu is extensively notated with dairy egg gluten nut free vegan, it lacks spiciness warnings. if you cannot handle spicy, i suggest avoiding anything that says curry leaves and or prophylactically getting yourself a glass of mango lassi."
32,Nipun S.,1118,5,6/12/16," stars for sure. the number of stars reviews that i write have gone down sharply since i have started writing more reviews. i try to reserve them for something special and unique. this place deserves stars for its combination of wonderful food and amazing ambience. i can nearly say that this place has the best ambience amongst the indian restaurants that i have been to in the us, till now. for people of indian origin, i would recommend this place for taking nonindian friends out to and especially if you have to take your parents or relatives out for a meal. this will definitely be a place that will leave a good impression. for everyone, this is the kind of ambience and food that i want every indian place should have. gets busy over the weekend so make a reservation. now that i have commented enough about other things let us get to the food. appetizers order the fried idllis, and chennai chicken. both are nice and good. main course being named dosa, we had to try some dosa's and they turned out to be pretty good. over two visits we have tried mung dosa, rava dosa, and paneer dosa. i liked the mung and rava dosa more than the paneer dosa. we tried some other entrees also really loved the prawn masala and the channa bhatura. if you do not want to have a dosa i would recommend either of these two. both had wonderful flavor. sweets ras malai was good. mango lassi was also good. enjoy the food and the environment."
33,Michelle L.,1118,4,1/6/16,"i was first introduced to the restaurant by the bf over a year ago. & since then i have been back numerous times. i kid you not this is his favorite restaurant! we threw his surprise th birthday dinner here because that is how much he loves dosa! i will not lie, the menu could be a little overwhelming for first timers. they give these complimentary bombbb crisps to start and they are so addictive! we have tried a bunch of their dishes but their menu is quite large. we have barely touched base on it. some of my faves are duck tacos it was too spicy for some of the lads so i had them all to myself lol chennai chicken samosas prawn masala sweet potato & white truffle masala i want to go back to dosa now after writing this review!!!"
34,Stephanie C.,1118,4,12/23/15,"a friend of mine made a reservation for a girls' night here and the ambiance definitely fit the bill! the decor and lighting make the place feel super upscale yet warm, somehow. loved that! onto the food be forewarned that if you have a palate that is slightly sensitive to spice, most of the items we ordered had a low heat that built up over the course of the meal. i personally love spicy, but i had friends who wished they would been warned about the spice on the menu beforehand. the menu was a bit overwhelming so we followed the recommendations of our waiter. would order again prawn masala the thick, flavorful yummy sauce! the prawns ! everything about this dish was just so good. a decentsized portion, too it came with large prawns yes.i counted. chennai chicken i would describe this dish as flavorful chicken tenders served with a yogurt sauce and onions. very shareable, good for a small group to split! masala dosa of course you have to order a dosa when you come to dosa! this was my first time trying one, and i loved the concept of various dipping sauces. i was underwhelmed by the south indian moons a sampler of uttapams because they all kind of tasted the same. if i were to return, i would stick with the dosas, appetizers, and entrees!"
35,Brian P.,1118,5,11/22/15,"the wait was super long on a friday night but it was worth it. we got the truffle masala dosa, frankly tacos this i would only give a . for and the prawn masala curry. the dosa and masala curry was out of this world good. wish they started this in ny!"
36,Zareen A.,1118,2,5/11/15,"last night my family and i went out to eat at dosa on fillmore to celebrate mother's day. unfortunately our time at this restaurant was a major disappointment from start to finish, and will linger in our minds as one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. prior to coming in we had made and confirmed a reservation through the dining room manager, dan, for fourteen people at seven thirty in the evening, yet when we arrived at the restaurant we were told that a reservation was made for only eight people by the host a man wearing a black hat and a goatee who had a very combative attitude and demeanor towards my uncle. we were told to wait and after some time we finally got a table for all of our party this negative incident set the tone for the rest of the evening which only got progressively worse as it went on. we started off with the chennai chicken for appetizers which had an extremely odd texture and a batter that was not particularly noteworthy and quite bland. the chicken biryani was flavorless, and did not taste at all like what a proper biryani should taste like. the prawn masala was passable however it was still very mediocre perhaps the most disappointing dish of all however, were the lamb chops which not only fell short of the proper marination but it also had a very off putting taste of raw and uncooked spices that made the dish highly unenjoyable for our palettes. the food that we ate at this restaurant was so unexceptional,forgettable and flavorless that we would never even think of considering to come back to this place. the chef if there is one needs proper training to bring out the delectable flavors that are commonly found in great indian cuisine.pseudo concoctions of spices, are not acceptable in an establishment where the prices are so lavishly expensive. we have no problem paying any amount provided that the food is in par with the prices being charged. while our waiter forest was attentive and did his job well, what we found to be even worse than the food at this restaurant was how we were treated towards the end of our meal. we completed eating our meal, but my father was still finishing his drink of gin and tonic when we were abruptly and quite rudely told to leave by the host who was a gentleman wearing a black hat and had a goatee, because apparently according to him there were too many people waiting to be seated and we were occupying space . we were absolutely flabbergasted by the way that we were treated no one should be disrupted from their dining experience and be told to leave and especially not when it was obvious that we were clearly not done and ready to go. considering the exorbitant amount of money we payed to eat here . , the host service and food that we received was not acceptable on any level. while the ambiance at this restaurant was beautiful, the subpar food combined with the disrespectful way that we were treated has left us with a very bad taste in our mouth and we will not be returning in the future. this is very typical of an absentee owner anjan mitra who is ambitious to expand his empire without any desire or passion to maintain and perfect the establishments that he already has. i highly recommend that the owner should retrain his staff and read the book setting the table by danny meyers, which is a must read for all of the staff in order to fully grasp and understand the basic and critical nuances of the hospitality industry."
37,Angela R.,1118,4,5/1/15,"i'm a fan of dosa in the mission and equally a fan of the one on fillmore. the interior space is stunning high ceilings and gorgeous artwork. i would recommend the seared scallops to start holy heck, were these good , and the prawn masala . throw in a bhatura for good measure. they have no beer on tap, but do have a decent bottled selection. also, the cocktails are fantastic. give dosa a shot for a lovely date night + movie at the kabuki!"
38,Aletta H.,1118,5,3/21/15,"paired with coconut rice, the prawn masala meets your wildest curry dreams. if you do not have those dreams, you will after dining here . the mandarin lentil salad is a fresh way to start your meal, along with glasses of light and airy pinot blanc. we sat at the bar and received menu recommendations from an bartender who looked like dwayne johnson. no complaints. the atmosphere is upscale trendy. we admired the the colorful jellyfish lights that dazzle the front area of the restaurant. the fillmore concert hall is a five minute walk from dosa, so you can enjoy a contemporary indian meal before a show."
39,Aman B.,1118,4,3/11/15,"we ordered the keema dosa, prawn masala , channa batura and the hyderabadi chicken biryani. the dosa with keema combo is spot on. prawn sauce is great with naan or other breads and the chicken biryani is solid."
40,Pim H.,1118,5,3/9/15,"i love white truffle dosa here. the prawn masala and halibut moilee are fantastic. i accidentally ate a chili pepper and the staff was super nice. she gave me the mango lasi which effectively removed the burn in my mouth. everything is fantastic here starting from location, atmosphere, restaurant decoration, food, and staff."
41,Neil S.,1118,5,10/21/18,"really enjoyed dosa on fillmore. it felt like a modern spin on indian food. the food was all delicious. had the paper masala dosa , which was great. mango lassi was really thick, maybe a little too thick, but really good. rasmalai was great. will definitely go back."
42,Karan A.,1118,2,10/14/18,"we have had three truly awful experiences at dosa after a few years of consistently decent food. this last one, today, was unfortunately strike three and we do not think we will be coming back. the food was incredibly spicy. not hot, but uncomfortably spicy and i can handle spice relatively easily. the service was aok. we ordered one appetizer and two entrees and while the appetizer was , both entrees were paper masala dosa as well as the egg curry with paratha. it is been hours since i ate this stuff and i still have heartburn. for the prices they charge, the meal was totally not worth it. i know their drinks are good, but for a cocktail is also kinda ridiculous if you want to have more than one drink. so, no thank you. we will not be coming back!"
43,Alison W.,1118,4,10/11/18,"i would never had south indian cuisine or dosas before. but some indian friends recommended this place and i'm always up for trying something new. we had kinda a large group so we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. though we sat around for about minutes after we arrived, while they were setting up our table. we got a bunch of appetizers samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. the idli fries are bomb. they were like right out of the fryer hot. not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. and it comes with a unique dipping sauce. the chutney sampler came with chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive and complementary papad kinda like indian chips . i could have just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you cannot have just one. samosas were ok nothing out of the ordinary. then the rest of us got some kind of dosa . i actually tried the uttapam sampler. uttapam is like a thicker dosa . i could not tell you all the different types of the uttapam but i enjoyed all five of them. all were vegetarian though and some had cheese that i remember. i also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa . the dosa itself is huge and crepelike and i like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce. i think i also got to try the bhatura, which is like the puffed crepe or flat bread. i think i liked it more than the paper dos, bc it had a bit more of a sweet flavor. everything i had was really good and thanks to our friends for showing this type of cuisine. i will definitely need to search out more southern indian cuisines."
44,Craig Y.,1118,5,7/14/18,"hard to find! but worth the search. when it comes to indian cuisine this place nails it. the dosa as you can imagine is a house specialty and well worth it. big enough for sharing, i recommend getting one dish per person and then sharing family style. today we tried the summer thali a sampler of about different dishes , the paper masala dosa basically potatoes and dosa , and south indian moons which were little glutenfree pancakes each highlighting a different ingredient. so much fun. food great!the taste was spicy without being overwhelming or too hot. the masala potatoes were among the best i've tried and i've tried a lot . and even though i did not do not love everything on the sampler platter i loved the chance to explore new flavors. allergyfriendly very allergyfriendly. the menu clearly marks which items are gluten, egg, dairy, and nut free. and it is good service seriously attentive people. came around often without being bothersome. filled up our water routinely without having to ask. and asked how things were going. if you are looking for good indian food in the bay near japantown come to dosa !"
45,Maggie T.,1118,4,4/7/18,"dosa on fillmore, san francisco april by maggiesfoodjournal from start to finish, the experience here was a day to remember. our server, pj was friendly and cheerful. she did not rush us to order and at the same time was very helpful. after we had sat down, pj brought a serving of papadum. these thin, crisp, chips with popping flavours were a hit at our table. our orders paper masala dosa dosa is a kind of pancake its main ingredients are rice and urad beans. dosa is a south indian dish popular all over the indian subcontinent. this large, thin, pliable, crispy, thin cracker came with potato and other dips. of rava masala potato masala with onions and cashew. it had the perfect spice and heat an excellent marriage with the crispy semolina wheat dosa . of lamb 'keema' three of us ordered this item. the plain dosa was a genius way to accompany the spiced minced lamb. of mango lassi all of us had the mango lassi. i am not a big fan of yogurt but i like mangoes so this gives me a chance to combine the two together. it is not too sweet and well balanced. of madras coffee the coffee seeds are shadegrown and brewed with chicory. gladly, i did not taste the chicory but i could use more sugar in my drink. . of ambience of "
46,Harsha P.,1118,5,3/30/18,accommodated us as walk ins on a busy night. was with a work colleague and they were quick to take our orders and serve us. the fried idli appetizer and the beet dahi vadas were absolutely amazing. we ordered the paper masala dosa and the paneer dosa . tons of food as we had to take some of the dinner entrees back for the next day. nice ambience and friendly service.
47,Aditya V.,1118,4,11/11/17,"overall, the food and service were great. we got the vada pav and chutney platter was a bit surprised they charged for chutney for the main course, i had a paper masala dosa and my friend had a chilli garlic dosa and they were both excellent. my dosa came out a bit cold, but they replaced it immediately and all was good. reserved via yelp reservations and the experience was seamless. a bit pricey, but hey, this is san francisco. i would recommend this place for a special occasion or a nice night out but reserve in advance as it tends to get full and you may end up having to sit at the community table."
48,Surashree K.,1118,3,8/25/17,"a couple of friends and i visited this place on a friday night with high expectations. the wait was about a half an hour we wish we would just gotten a reservation via yelp instead. the food was fine definitely not the best dosas i've had. we got the idli fries and vada pav to start with. both were v.good, the fries nice and crunchy and loaded with a tasty spice rub, the vada pav a delicious mixture of sweet and sour protip from a mumbaikar where the vada pav was invented make the vada less soggy by holding back on the imli chutney! also would have been nice if it was a tad spicy . all in all, the appetizers were a success. for mains we got the paper masala dosa and have to say, was a little disappointed, esp for a place that is named after this lovely south indian dish. the portions are on the small side by indian food standards, but i guess that is what you expect from an upscale place oh, and our server was super nice. would definitely go back again to try other items on the menu."
49,Prarthna A.,1118,1,7/4/17,"unpleasantly surprised! disclaimer this is my favorite restaurant in the city and i am regular here! made a reservation to go here for dinner tonight for july th and the service was horrible! the restaurant was busy which is understood but there was clear chaos in the service. it took the waiter a good minutes to come by the table to take the order. after we finally ordered here is sequence of events drinks ordered a glass of wine, a beer, kingfisher and a kids mango lassi. the first drinks to arrive was mango lassi came in a kids cup but no straw and the wine. asked the server about the missing beer and he said he will check and he walked away casually without acknowledging the missing straw on the cup ! hello!! how do you expect the kid to drink that will come back to the beer in a bit. asked another server passing by for a straw and he delivered one. ordered vada pav for appetizer & prawn masala , paratha and paper masala dosa for entree. the first food item to be delivered was the prawn masala which comes with rice minus the paratha. no sign of appetizer either or the beer. story of the beer after more minutes of waiting the waiter stopped by and my husband asked for the beer and his response ! we ran out of kingfisher yesterday. i am sorry i just found out, can i get you a pilsner instead my husband, ahhh ok, please do! and the beer came after another minutes of ordering that!!! phew! and then came the paratha! and another mins after that came the appetizer, vada pav. my little one then asks, mommy, where is the dosa which took them another minutes or so . gawd!!! utter and complete chaos in service today!!"
50,Yash D.,1118,2,5/20/17,"basically this place is regular mediocre food served in a fancy setting. the decor gets full marks, the food disappointing at best. just the name says dosa , but the dosa idlis are no good. the garlic and chile dosa was not any good. the idli and vada was cold and horrible. the bhutura was sweet and very oily, and tasted weird. the sambhar was not any good as well. the paper dosa and paper masala dosa was the reason i give the one star. maybe the curries are good do not visit for any dosa or idlis. management, please change the name to everything but dosas . update spoke to management about how i did not like the food and i felt the management was genuinely interested in getting my feedback, which is reassuring. maybe i will revisit."
51,Jen B.,1118,4,2/22/16,"i've been here twice now. i really love this restaurant overall. i would give it five stars for decor and service. it is gorgeous inside and they play nice music in the background. the menu has beautiful choices of traditional dishes as well as interesting fusion dishes like black truffle dosa . hmmmm! we have tried and loved the chennai chicken, vada pav, paper masala dosa , and uttapams. delicious!!!!! i cannot tell you how great those things are. the only reason they do not get five stars is their chutneys. the coconut and tomato chutneys they serve with their dosas are both not very good at all. if they changed their recipes for these dishes i would easily give this restaurant five stars."
52,Shweta M.,1118,4,8/12/14,"been to both the locations a countless times dosa fillmore & valencia but this one hands down is my favorite. what we usually order tamil lamb with malaysian paranthas spicy & yum lately for some reason, they are mostly out of their malaysian paranthas dahi rice it used to be really good but taste has gone down a bit the past two times i have ordered it. it always needs some seasoning! paneer & peas dosa my husband's all time favorite!! their paper masala dosa and chile utthapam is pretty decent as well idli sambhar super chennai chicken another yummer lamb chops little sweet for my indian taste buds vada pav mini sliders.perfect and so tasty! this was definitely a starred restaurant for us, but in my last two visits to dosa , i was a little unhappy with my dahi rice and sambhar, and hence the stars. another thing that i usually get very annoyed with is their constant menu changes, another downer for me. not a big fan of their desserts except one, so if you love mangoes, make sure you leave some room for their mango pudding, tried & tested many times!! tip weekdays or weekends, the place is always crowded, so always best to make reservations."
53,Justin G.,1118,5,12/12/13,"great spot for folks looking to get away from indian food that solely consists of chicken tikka masala . dosa's take on south indian food is great everything has so much flavor. our favorite was the paper masala dosa and duck vindaloo very spicy . we always end up ordering way too much food. only negative is that the service can be a bit slow, but that is it."
54,The Bottomless Pi T.,1118,4,12/11/13,"i love dosas , and i love dosa too! we went here for lunch, and the place was pretty empty when we arrived. we had the lamb frankie and the paper masala dosa . the lamb arrived wrapped and cut in half, perfect for sharing. that was probably my favorite part of the meal. when the dosa arrived, we stared at how big it was. we could not fit it on the table for without spilling over to the nearby table. good thing no one was sitting next to us. food was excellent. the only thing preventing stars was the price. love the high ceilings and ambiance."
55,Shrenik D.,1118,4,12/3/13,"the ambience is great for a date or family get togethers. we had to wait mins on a saturday evening even though we had a reservation. we ordered these . vada pav excellent, must haves, especially tastes awesome with the gunpowder chutney. . kaju paneer masala the paneer was tasty but the paratha was basically the 'kawan paratha' anybody who shops at indian grocery stores would know which disappointed us a bit since it was not 'home made'. . paper masala dosa the dosa and masala were regular, nothing out of the ordinary being an indian and having eaten dosas growing up ."
56,Maria G.,1118,3,3/4/13,"the food was yumm, but maybe i had expectations set up too high, and so i got a bit disappointed. it was good, but not awesome! sample of uppadam, stars. paper masala dosa , . even if it was on the big eat list , chicken curry, stars. vada pav, big eat list . desert chesecake , , good, but sooo small."
57,Christy L.,1118,4,11/1/12,"you would be hardpressed to find something amiss at dosa well, i'm sure there are those out there who could find it.but then, they are just cranky! . this restaurant has something for everyone! sexy datenight spot check! fun space for groups check! happy hour with friends check! a place to impress outoftowners check! the food is wonderful.not your traditional indian fare.but ohso delicious and a perfect way to comfortably ease your nonadventurous food friends into trying something besides meat and potatoes! everything on the menu is wonderful.a must have is the paper masala dosa . they have the most wonderful, flavorful and rich curries and sauces. they even have some tasty items for the nomeaties in your life. the drinks are wonderful! yeah, i'm a total fan "
58,Shira C.,1118,5,9/20/12,"a cozy yet casual, intimate yet fun place and experience. i came with two girl friends on a monday night around and were seated immediately by the window. we stuffed ourselves and i am now a fan of dosa and am so so glad that the x list brought me here! good things so pretty much everything we ordered appetizer vada pav veggie slider okay so the name really does not do it justice, mostly because i love meat and think all sliders should be made with beef patties, but this was so flavorful and delicious. the bun is sweet and the caramelized onions provide a nice contrast to the dry but perfectly seasoned potatoes. the dish comes with gunpowder, which is this spicy chili powder that you mix with melted butter to form a chili spread. it is really fun to make haha. btw this is also super spicy. main courses channa bhatura probably my favorite indian dish ever. this gigantic fried, puffy dough comes out and hot steam actually comes out when you tear into it. it is such a wonderful sight! then you dip the bread into this wonderfully flavorful chickpea dish and you can expect what my roommate calls a food baby for the rest of the evening. so worth it. i've had this dish at vik's chaat in berkeley, but the puffy thing is overly greasy there. it is actually quite light and flavorful here. paper masala dosa this is what i came to try, the infamous paper masala dosa . it is actually humungous so, if you can visualize, three girls at the smallest table possible with the giant bhatura and now this long dosa too. i think we were in a little over our heads when we ordered so our waiter advised us on how to eat this, by tearing off a piece of the crispy dosa and dipping it into the potato mixture and then dipping it into one of three sauces sambar, a tomato sauce and a coconut sauce. we ended up mixing and matching everything on our table, which was an extremely pleasant experience for our tastebuds haha. the only complaint about this dish is that the dosa itself is a little salty, so dipping it is kind of necessary to offset the saltiness. dessert rasmalai i do not know how we managed to do this because we basically had carbs for our entire meal, but we ended up picking this. it is a surprisingly light dessert even though it is creamy and has the texture of panna cotta but is made of cheese! the rosewater fragrance is really nice and the pistachios add a great texture. perfect way to end such a heavy meal. the total came out to be after tax and tip. the best part was probably our waiter who explained how to eat everything haha. definitely coming back to try all the other different dosas .and to have something with meat."
59,Raina B.,1118,4,5/24/12," . stars now this is yelp, the thank you economy, and pure customer service done right. the owner reached out to me regarding my aok review and welcomed me to come back and try a few appetizers on him. i literally live blocks away so my roommates and i stopped by here on tuesday night for dinner . their dinner offerings were excellent. all the items provide very generous servings and they definitely kicked up the spice a notch with these dishes. we got the following chaat mangos in chaat who would have thought. apparently this is a south indian norm to put fruit in chaat and i do not know why us northerners have not picked up on how good that is. dahi vada amazing presentation and great taste. they really know how to take indian street food and make it classy pakora to be fair, i'm not a fan of these generally so i have a bit of a bias against this dish. clever take on the chutneys mimicking ketchup and mustard. paper masala dosa solid traditional dosa dish. ask for extra of the orange chutney. nom. basil dosa of us are indian and have grown up with all this goodness. this dosa made all of us take a step back and admire how they made this. it is like pesto meets masala . very good. channa batura seriously, the batura was bigger than my head. insane. the channa was excellent. the batura was definitely a little oily for my liking but that tends to happen when its deep fried. needless to say, i definitely had my mind changed and cannot wait to make this a neighborhood regular. cheers to your restaurant, anjan."
60,Sarah C.,1118,4,3/3/12,"i work at ucsf mount zion location and my office of women orders a bunch of food togo for lunch on a monthly basis. today, my roommate and i went here for lunch to help her knock off the paper masala dosa from her x list. we walked in around noon on a friday and it was pretty empty. the restaurant is very spacious and beautiful inside. we ordered the south indian mung salad, the south indian bhel puri, paper masala dosa and green mango & panner uttapam. the food took a very long time to come out, which was surprising since there were not that many guests, but when it did arrive, i forgot all about the wait. i love love love their food. the mung salad was very refreshing and tasty, the indian bhel puri gave me new flavor explosions in my mouth with each bite, and of course, the paper masala dosa with the sauces and soup is always delicious and very x worthy, in my opinion. the only reason why i cannot give this place a star rating is because of the service. even though our waiter was very attentive and lovely, the food did take a while to come out. our uttapam never arrived, which i was thankful for in the end because i was so full , but the waiter kindly removed it from our bill. this place is a mustgo!"
61,Godfrey. Godfrey M.,1118,5,10/15/18,who can believe that you can get authentic south indian dishes from dosas to fried idli to prawn curry and biryani and great drinks from the bar like turmeric musk mule . ha ha what a combo to have a dash of turmeric. loved the thought behind it .

64,Surina S.,1118,3,10/10/18,"i am a south indian food fanatic. i grew up in south bay with access to practically hundreds dosa restaurants in sight. i was sooo excited to come here. and after coming here twice, i just do not get the hype. our idlis were so cold and the sambar luke warm. both times. the dosa was more like oil with some dosa batter. it is a shame because i would have loved to take people here who visit but i'm not sure if our food will even fit on the table!!! bummer."
65,Safia K.,1118,4,9/2/18,"dosa on filmore had a great ambience as soon as i walked in. the staff was extremely welcoming even though we came a little late for our reservation the staff made sure to accommodate us. for the table, my family and i ordered a the kerala chicken, vada pav, idli fries, dosas paneer masala, rava, paper the rava dosa was my favorite on the menu. the paneer masala was not very appetizing. the kerala chicken was spicy and extremely fried! really great for a cheat meal. at the end of our meal, i ordered their herbal tea and it was enough for share for three to four people! it was great after the big meal for my family and i. overall, i really enjoyed this place but wish the dosa was more adorable. for a dosa is white pricey but the appetizers were worth the lunch!"
66,Curtis L.,1118,5,8/26/18,"i have found my new favorite indian restaurant in san francisco! thank you christine the manager for such a great meal and evening all in all! the crab balls better known as poori were to die for! those idli fries were so darn good i could have had them for my dinner but then i would not have had the opportunity to try the goat shank which was absolutely perfect! i even got to shake the chefs' hand who prepared it as well!! our waitress cat was so on, along with eduardo and naveen! everything ran so smoothly i can not thank you enough dosa for making this a wonderful indian culinary experience !!"
67,Apoorva A.,1118,4,7/24/18,"for my family, dosas comfort food. when you are hungry and just want something flavorful and filling, dosas are usually a goto. so, when we walked in to dosa on fillmore, we had very high expectations. walking in through the large heavy door, you are instantly greeted by the heavenly aromas of south indian cuisine in an open room, lit by elegant chandeliers. we came in at around pm on a saturday evening without a reservation and opted to sit at the communal table to avoid the wait. luckily, we got a spot at the end, so it was not too cramped for the four of us. our server was friendly and attentive, despite being quite busy, and patiently answered all of our questions. my family and i ordered the idli sambar, chile garlic dosa, rava masala dosa, masala dosa, and spicy mung masala dosa. the complimentary papadum was thin and crispy, although a couple of the pieces were slightly stale. the idli sambar was fantastic the idlis were perfectly soft and not too grainy as some restaurants tend to make them, and the sambar was so flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. all of our dosas were pretty great good texture, just the right amount of soft and crispy, and strong spices spread across the chile garlic and the spicy mung dosas. the only thing lacking was a little more flavor in the potato filling in each dosa it could have used a tad more salt and masala. otherwise, the dosas were filling and made for a great meal. we left around , and the place seemed to still be bustling. i wish we would tried the desserts they sounded decadent but we were already so full from the dosas. next time i would probably try more of the shared plates for greater variety. the prices are on the higher end, but food, service, and ambience all make it worth it."
68,Ajay G.,1118,1,7/22/18,"we ordered dosas and idli fries. the idlies were over fried and the chutney did not have any salt. the mushroom utthappam was undercooked. all in all, not really worth the price, except for great ambience and atmosphere."
69,Bob K.,1118,4,6/17/18,"great indian spot near japantown good dosas, fantastic pepper shrimp and some incredible chicken and pork curries. really loved the avocado appetizer as well. idli , samosas chicken were familiar and super yummy. would have appreciated a bit more help navigating the menu instead of us saying what do you recommend and the server asking well, what do you like "
70,Pragyan P.,1118,4,6/15/18,"just satisfy your appetite and make your day complete with the yummy south indian food, loved avocado chat and vada pav sliders, idli fry. amazing ambience and cool place to hang out with friends!!!!"
71,Manojna K.,1118,3,5/1/18,"south indian food with a twist. i am not a fan of paneer but their paneer matar dosa was sooo good it melts in your mouth. loved the avocado chaat, idli fries, mango lassi with a hint of cardamom, and the uthappam sampler. the sambar was pretty fantastic too. the only let down of this place we are the chutneys. all of them were bland for my liking."
72,Nibha K.,1118,3,4/27/18,"hmm.so stars for the ambience! but the food is just about average. it is really over priced south indian food which does not even taste like authentic south indian food. we ordered the vada sambar, idli fries and rava masala dosa. all of these were just okay, nothing great at all. have had amazing south indian food at other places in the bay area, so this is nothing in comparison to that. but yes the ambience is really good. so combining the ambience and the average food you will still have a good dining experience overall."
73,Harsha P.,1118,5,3/30/18,accommodated us as walk ins on a busy night. was with a work colleague and they were quick to take our orders and serve us. the fried idli appetizer and the beet dahi vadas were absolutely amazing. we ordered the paper masala dosa and the paneer dosa. tons of food as we had to take some of the dinner entrees back for the next day. nice ambience and friendly service.
74,Sophie W.,1118,2,3/22/18,"reserved a table for at pm on wednesday, and when i called to move up my reservation to on the same day, i was told that they were all booked. this place is super popular, and entering through the nondescript door which is automatic, by the wayyou only need to give it a tug brings you into this cavernous world of chandeliers and smelling of spices. i will say it is a bit of a tight squeeze if you are sitting in the booths against the side walls you will probably get more intimate with the tables next to you than you will with your partner. we ordered the mango lassi, idli fries, chutney sampler, and masala dosa. the complimentary pappad was so thin and delicious, especially dipped in the chutney sampler. the sauces do pack a decent amount of heat, and the idli fries are super crispy and gluten free !! . however, we did discover that the two sauces we were given with the fries were the same as the ones in the chutney sampler. poor planning on our part and lack of creativity on theirs. i was probably least impressed with the dosa. the sauces it came with were not flavorful enough, and there was only a small patch of potatoes in the very center. you cannot skimp on potatoes like that and think it is okay, especially if you are charging for what is essentially an oversize crepe. i think you can get better dosas elsewhere for lower prices, and the only justification dosa gets for charging what it does is the ambiance."
75,Neil B.,1118,1,2/17/18,"i brought my family who was visiting for philadelphia on a saturday night, and the ambiance looked promising. first off we were not even provided a drink menu. we ordered an assortment of shared plates including idli fries, vada pav, brussel sprouts, and avocado bhel. we spoke with the waitress letting her know that my wife was allergic to chickpeas, she confirmed with the chefs and informed us that she could have everything except the vada pav. turns out the avocado bhel had chickpeas, which we informed our waitress about and later spoke with the manager about. manager then confirmed that the rest of our dosas and uttapam order will have no chickpeas. ridiculously, everything contained it. the sambhar has chickpeas, the dosa potato filling had chickpeas. the manager confirmed with the chefs and they blatantly lied and denied that there was chickpeas. the manager had to show the actual split chickpeas in the filling before they accepted it. plain ridiculous and unacceptable. our waitress was also very slow and did not check up on us. we accidentally spilled water and despite staring right at us did nothing to help. which for a high end establishment is just plain wrong. apart from those major issues, the overall food was pretty average. shared plates were good, but the dosas were standard indian fare, could not taste any pear flavor in the pear masala dosa, the uttapams were not fully cooked, and the sauces chutneys were subpar. if you are looking for modern indian cuisine there are many better options in the city. dosa was very disappointing and i would not recommend it."
76,Praveen K.,1118,5,1/19/18,"lamb sliders, vada pav, idli fries, all dosas, pani poori and awesome cocktails. yummm . must visit"
77,Shatakshi G.,1118,4,1/7/18,"tried this restaurant for the first time during the new year week and everything for the table was super good both north indian and south indian food. we had already done reservation as we were a big party of people. when we arrived for dinner they had set aside the table for us. we ordered idli fries and vada pav as appetizers. the vada pav is a must try. it was one of the best you can have around bay area. for the main course we ordered a variety of dishes including extremely spicy mixed chille uttapam, idli sambar, moong daal dosa, south indian moons uttapam, spicy pear dosa and roasted chille and garlic dosa. all the dishes were delicious, a contemporary blend of authentic south indian flavors without being too overpowering on the spices. the sambar which came with all the dosa's and uttapam's was especially mind blowing. interiors are nicely done. it is clean and the service is quick. we had to circle around for a bit to find parking. price wise it is a bit on the expensive side . deducted one star for the server who was not very friendly and pleasant to talk to. apart from that a great experience. will recommend to try it out atleast once if you are in around the area."
78,Ani J.,1118,4,1/2/18,"since the first time i tried this place in , i have been a fan. this is easily one of the places i visit when i travel to san francisco. i had not been there in many years, so when my trip to san francisco finalized, i knew i was going back for sure. i actually ended up eating here twice during my recent trip. the food is still as good. i did end up trying a few new things. but the service has gone down for sure, hence, taking a point off. the service is slow, the servers not as attentive. one of the servers came to our table after we had been waiting for minutes. as soon as she arrived, she said are you ready to order no greeting, no nothing. kind of a turn off at a fancy restaurant as this one. now to the food idli fries unique idea for sure as i have never had idli fries before. its definitely on the spicy side, as they pour red chilli powder on it. so make sure you can handle spice before you order this. vada paav still as good as how i remember from . absolutely love it. rava masala dosa delicious.i always prefer the rava dosa crust over the other dosas. chana bhatura the channa chickpeas is a blend of fava beans and chickpeas, which is a bit of an interesting blend. i would personally prefer just the regular chana indian style . ras malai delicious dessert. madras coffee usually the madras coffee i have had is served in a steel glass, but this one comes in a regular cup. its really good and worth trying. after years, i am still a fan. i may not visit the golden gate bridge, but i will surely visit this place every time i go to san francisco "
79,Kim B.,1118,1,12/18/17,"honestly, this used to be my absolute favorite restaurant for years in san francisco. i moved away to co about two years ago, and came back recently to dine there, and it was the worst indian food i've ever had. i asked the waitress why everything was so different, and she said they recently had some menu changes. i could not be more depressed about this. i ordered the idli fries as an appetizer, which were unimpressive and the prawn masala as my entree. the curry to the prawn masala tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry. my mom ordered a chicken curry, which also had a watery consistency, and no flavor. this is one of the pricier indian restaurants, and i had always felt it was worth it perviously, but if you are thinking of going there now, i would advise you to save your money."
80,Goutam M.,1118,3,12/8/17,"not worth the hype. the fried idlies were good, the rest, dosas and chicken fry, were average."
81,Cin-Yee S.,1116,5,11/5/18,"if i had more money, i would be awash in coconut cream pies, lemon cream tarts, and morning buns with a hint of orange . a worthwhile treat, and easy to get if you show up a few minutes before it opens at am."
82,Mary X.,1116,4,10/22/18,"pretty long waits throughout the day, but you have to try the banana cream tart. it was the best i've had mission pie comes very close . the crust is phenomenal and there is a caramelized flavor to it that makes it that much better. the croissants are huge and the lamination on them are pretty spot on. i personally thought the croissant was too crunchy though, was looking for a bit of fluff in the middle. morning bun was also very flaky and firm. i do not really eat morning buns though so i do not know how they should taste. the chocolate chip walnut cookie is big but very flat and super crispy. i enjoyed it, despite know all that extra butter is probably the secret to the nice crunch it has. would come back to try their lemon meringue cake and other cream tarts!"
83,Alex C.,1116,5,9/24/18,"holy smokes. the morning buns . everything they make here is good. but the morning buns are on another level. i've had good croissants, scones, tea cakes. but i have not had a morning bun , cinnamon bun , breakfast roll that was as good as their morning buns . if anything, it is worth the wait for one of those. normally the wait is minutes, so do not be surprised if the line is just outside the door."
84,Shelley P.,1116,5,9/22/18,"mornings are for morning buns ! this was my second time visiting san francisco and tartine, and i was not disappointed. i went late monday morning and was pleased to find a short line. i was mesmerized by all the options but since morning buns are one of their most popular options, i decided to go with that having also had fond memories from last time . all the workers i interacted with were so incredibly friendly as well one of them even gave me recommendations for where to walk around in sf as i was wandering around that day. i decided to take a while to sit and journal at one of the tables inside here's some of my badgrammar ramblings about the pastry i take bites of my morning bun slowly because i want to savor every bite & because it was freaking expensive hah. but its worth it a delightful crispy flakiness on the outside it snaps into pieces as you bite, but it is held together by the caramelized sugar that covers it, slightly sticky on your teeth, tinted with orange like the grownup version of those orange slice gummies from your childhood. the sugar crystals fall in love with the corners of your mouth, as your tongue falls in love with the buttery softness of the bun , & as your mind starts to wonder if you could ever live in a world without baked goods. "
85,Laura K.,1116,4,9/1/18,loved the morning buns ! i agree with other reviews that orange flavored foods generally are a big no but this is an exception. very flaky with the right moisture content. bread was also yummy. i would skip the coffee though as there are better options in the mission district.
86,Clare L.,1116,4,8/31/18,"banana cream tart . tart is very light and creamy and the crust is buttery, flaky and crunchy. it is sweet but not overpowering! their banana cream tart was the only thing i got from tartine bakery so i cannot say much about other pastry. but it is definitely worth a try and wait! next time, i would like to try their morning buns ! if i am in the area, i would take banana cream tart and morning buns to go with my coffee and enjoy them at dolores park! the only reason i took one star off is price.it seems like everything there is bit pricey."
87,Cameran L.,1116,5,8/20/18,"do not be deterred by the long lines to get in. it is worth the wait. go here for the banana cream tart and the morning buns , then take them to go with your favorite coffee and a blanket and sit on the lawn at dolores park. these heavenly moments are what living in san francisco is all about."
88,D D.,1116,5,7/12/18,"tldr highly recommended! here's what to do to make the most of your visit time your trip properly. be patient since there is almost always a line. savor the delicious treats and breads that are obviously baked with love. repeat again and again! overall rating a+++ i'm from nyc so i know good bakeries. during my one week vacation in san francisco, this was the only place i had to come back to a second time. i loved it that much! yes, there was always a wait when i went around pm. but it was totally worth it! dessert is my favorite meal so this was heaven for me. i love they treat their coop employees well and they get to sleep at night. on the flip side that means you need to wait until staggered times throughout the day to get certain things, such as first thing in the morning to get their morning buns + breakfast goodies after am for made to order hot sandwiches minute wait after pm for breads longer if you want half loaves since they need to cool keep in mind they do run out of things as it gets later! so make sure to time your trip properly to get what you want! if you come before the breads are ready, they will write your name and bread order they do half loaves! on their bread list. they will call your name when your delicious carbs are ready and you pay for the breads upon pick up. here's what i tried across my visits latte . i'm not a huge coffee fan, but i sampled my friend's latte and it was amazing! not that bitter even without any sweetener. i was so enamored i got a small bag of the coffee beans to take home ! strawberry mousseline cake . hands down my favorite of everything i tried here! the whipped cream was nice and light. the strawberries were fresh though oddly whole so a bit awkward to eat share . the cake layer was moist. what is not to love tastes like a better version of strawberry shortcake. the slice is pretty small though. might be a seasonal cake so enjoy it while you can! a+++ chocolate souffle cake slice . valrhona chocolate mousse on a thin layer of chocolate cake topped with chocolate ganache if you like chocolate, you will love this! layers of decadent chocolate and it was not too sweet. a+ chocolate hazelnut tart . sweet pastry she will, guanaja, orange i was not a huge fan of this myself. i just did not like the orange flavor in this, but that is a personal preference. b+ eclair . vanilla cream, valhrona glaze not a fan of eclairs and this did not change my mind about them, but my mother liked it. b half olive bread . only available wed, fri, and sun holy moly! i want to eat this everyday! this was my favorite of the breads. i regret not getting a whole loaf of this, but i already had so much bread from the day before. i needed to wait until my next visit to try this since they are only available days a week! excellent texture, just wish there were more olives. the olives had a slight citrus flavor. try to eat the bread right away. i've never had such fresh bread in my life! it had literally just came out of the oven! a+++ sesame bread . great but not as good as the olive bread. a half ancient grain bread . nice and hearty. but not as good as the olive bread. a i really wanted to try the porridge bread but it did not bake properly that day. fyi all the bread i tried were very crusty and on the harder side. though the inside was light and soft! there is % surcharge on your bill to support employee benefits, which i think is great. the employees are super sweet! they patiently explained all the daily breads and bread ordering procedures to me. i think all their breads are sourdough based. love that they have self serve water on the side with compostable packaging utensils here. there is a bathroom between the register and coffee bar. you may even get to see them pulling out fresh breads from their giant oven if you come around pm on your way to the bathroom! if there is no where to sit at tartine, walk to the nearby gorgeous mission dolores park to enjoy your treats al fresco! the prices are a little higher here, but it is so worth it. i spent almost here over days. no regrets! i would definitely come here again the next time i'm in san francisco!"
89,Florence A.,1116,4,7/9/18," pm on a friday and the line is out the door for good reason! the baked goods are outstanding croissants, chocolate croissants and morning buns were on my purchase list. i was sorry to miss their kouign amann, which i hear is wonderful. i will definitely go back to try more!"
90,Sarah R.,1116,5,7/8/18,"the morning buns are to die for, they have cinnamon with a hint of orange zest and they the crust from baking it perfect to break open. the location is quaint and fun to find because there is not sign, which makes this bakery even more fantastic, they do not need a sign to make it known."
91,Eric H.,1116,5,7/5/18,"every single time i visit the bay area, i have to visit tartine. morning buns are the best."
92,Kedar M.,1116,4,6/27/18,dropped by this place at am on a weekend morning . there was a min wait line. nice cutesy interiors. they have a few seater tables outside too. tried multiple other things. our favourites were the morning buns and the savory bacon scone. yum!! could not try the banana cream tarts as supposedly they were not going to be ready till am. will be back for more!
93,Cesar R.,1116,5,6/5/18,"sf is all about standing in lines, but this bakery is actually worth it! from morning buns to almond croissants, no crumbs left on my plate!"
94,Patrick S.,1116,5,6/3/18,"tartine bakery is going to be the ruin of any diet plans! whenever i do want to splurge in the city, i make a stop by tartine. as one gets closer to the establishment, one can delightfully enjoy the smells of the bakery. unfortunately, everytime i drop by there is always a line to order something from their delicious bakery with the morning times understandably having the longest lines. i have ordered a variety of different things here but here are a list of things that i have particularly enjoyed banana creme tart the tart particularly nails the banana flavor with nicely sliced pieces of banana layered in the filling. but the nice surprise is the layers of milk chocolate along the pie crust which make for a beautiful match made in tastebud heaven. morning buns they would be a welcome pick me up for any day! not knowing what these were, they are basically a flaky croissant like pastry lightly flavored with a orange zest that could easily be laced with crack! croque monsieur enveloped with golden bread to indicate the buttery goodness that has soaked in each of the slices and then filled with hearty pieces of cheese and ham. surprisingly, it never feels awfully heavy where i am in an induced food coma. these come with pickled carrots that definitely provide a welcome acidity to cut through. the service is fast and friendly. the space inside the actual establishment is small so if you are planning to have a nice brunch with a bunch of your friends you are better off planning to take these goodies to go and walk off to the park. parking is limited and again may be better to walk over. overall, tartine bakery has a lot of great pastries that are worth picking up and enjoying in the city."
95,Miya M.,1116,5,6/2/18,the morning buns are the most delicious pastry ever! the line is long the it is worth it!
96,Christina R.,1116,4,5/31/18,"definitely a staple. there is a reason people will wait in long lines just to get a single treat or loaf of bread. there is a reason young cooks clamor their way into this kitchen and take pride in saying they have worked here. everything is delicious and worth your wait in line. i try to try a different item every time i come out because i just cannot eat it all at once. the portion sizes are actually quite large and the items are pretty rich. this time around i got a chocolate croissant and a lemon bar. sooooo gooooood!! i can say that the scones esp savory are incredible, as well as the morning buns . and the bread! i also have not noticed a dip in quality over the years. i mean the place has been open over years and it is super popular. a lot of places like that tend to dip quality wise and rely on their name alone. i really wanted to try their coffee. i feel like i should have but i was not in a coffee mood. for sure i will next time."
97,Angela L.,1116,5,5/30/18,"there has to be a reason why there is always a line out the door, why people are willing to wait up to minutes just to get inside, why there are thousands of raving reviews. and that reason is morning buns . and the lemon cream tart. and the savory scone. and the lemon bar. it was our first time here and we did not know what to expect. obviously parking in the city is tough, but we found a meter a few blocks away. we got there around am, so i was worried about the wait. the line wrapped around the corner, but it went by quickly. it was longer by the time we left. the employees were kicking ass with the never ending line. they got us in and out quickly and painlessly. we had to stop ourselves from ordering more than morning buns . i had read tons of yelp reviews raving about those delicious pastries, and i knew that i had to try one.or five. we also picked up a lemon cream tart and a lemon bar because my boyfriend absolutely loves all things lemony. man, that tart was just heavenly so smooth, so creamy, so decadent. the lemon bar was the perfect combination of tart and sweet, and the pine nut crust was so buttery and crumbly. with all this sweetness, we also picked up a savory scone for some salty counterbalance. my god, what a clutch decision to get that scone. it was probably the best scone i had ever had in my life. i was initially hesitant about trying it because scones are usually too dry for my liking, but this bad boy was buttery and moist from the cheese and it packed a helluva flavor punch from the bacon. i'm salivating just thinking about it. everything tasted amazing fresh out of the box, and they surprisingly held up well after a day or two, so we had a wonderful treat for our trip home. totally worth the wait, i'm looking forward to trying everything else!"
98,Josh N.,1116,5,5/19/18,"amazing holy grail of bakeries in sf. i live here and still make a quarterly if not more trip to the original tarting for morning buns , croissants, bread loaves and most importantly bread pudding. this place simply makes the best bp i have ever had in my life. go early morning when they open or mid afternoon before when they serve bread to reduce your wait in line. it can be large but it moves quickly and the pastries are delicious. i like darker roasts of coffee so, for me, the coffee here tastes too bright and acidic. other people seem to like it fine"
99,Karissa A.,1116,5,4/27/18,if i could give this place stars i would the lemon tarts are amazing i want to order like whenever i go. the morning buns are delicious they taste like a sugar bun with a hint of orange and they are a little bit sticky and they taste so amazing like heaven. the bread pudding is good too i would drive hours just for this place. if you want to get there before they sellout go before pm
100,Al W.,1116,4,4/25/18,"the line was minimal during late afternoon. however, the downside was they were out of morning buns and their famous lemon tart. i settled for their seasonal fruit tart, which was not very impressive. i ve had many tarts that were just as good, if not better. but i also bought a lemon tea cake and that blew my mind away. it was so dense and moist with a nice, sweet outer layer. i've never tasted any thing like it. i would rate the tea cake a five and the tart as a three star, hence, my four star rating. i would definitely come back to try all their other items based off the level of execution on their tea cake."
101,John L.,1116,5,11/2/18,"candied orange and cinnamon sugar they are not as common a combination as peanut butter and jelly, thunder and lightning, or russell westbrook and poor fg percentage, but tartine bakery and cafe surely did their homework to roll them up into the finest morning bun ever. dipped in even more sugar, it was surprisingly not as sweet as it looked. it is flaky, buttery, and cinnamony, much like a cross between a croissant and a cinnamon roll in full swing! the morning bun alone is reason enough to come back, but the croque monsieur with shiitake mushroom will make the decision even easier. simply put, a croque monsieur is a ham and cheese sandwich but a lot better. their offering came with a choice of ham, turkey, shiitake mushroom, or fromage blanc. our order came nicely baked with plenty of mushrooms and melted gruyere cheese. my younger daughter enjoyed it so much that she wanted a single slice to be her next birthday cake. we just need to buy some candles! we also tried the huge gougere savory choux pastry with gruyere cheese and the largerthanusual pain au chocolat chocolate croissant . they were also delicious, but not as impressive as the other two items we had. the quiche , scone, croissant, cookie, tart, and cake looked appetizing as well, but we would have gone home broke had we decided to try them all. the wait was long and the prices were steep, but the quality and taste of the food were superior. seating oneself could be a challenge, but mission dolores park is just a couple of blocks away. enjoy the stroll while slowly nibbling away at that delightful morning bun."
102,Kevin N.,1116,5,10/24/18,"do yourself a favor a take a day off work and treat yo self with some delicious food from tartine. the line is totally worth it, but if you want to avoid the hassle, try to come on a weekday. the place itself is pretty small. if you have a large party, do not expect to be seated. they have a few tables inside and then three tables outside. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant. must get. morning bun sweet and delicious. the orange really comes through the whole bun and not just the outside quiche i've never had a quiche this perfect before. the egg is the perfect soft consistency sourdough take a giant loaf home. so tasty and will last you a while"
103,Christopher L.,1116,5,10/21/18,"omg do not get me started on tartine. i've been here at least times so far and have been coming at least twice a month since i've moved here it is rare that i go anywhere more than once . it also does not help that i live a block away from this delightful, delicious bakery. the pastries they make here are probably the best i've ever had in the city. i would say my favorite are the almond croissant and the banana cream tart. i've also tried the regular croissant, chocolate croissant, ham and cheese croissant, morning bun, buttermilk scone, lemon meringue cake, ham and egg quiche and the croque monsieur with ham. so i will speak about the croissants in general. the croissants they create here are huge, you might think that is crazy for a croissant but i've paid for croissants that are half the size. here, they are super sized and can be a meal in itself! the croissants have a dry, crunchy surface that breaks super easily, but a warm, cozy, fluffy inside that almost melts in your mouth. their croissants here are so good and you would be fine choosing any croissant. the banana cream tart is even more filling, it really satisfies the craving for any sweet tooths out there. it comes with banana, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate flakes and a whole bunch of other goodness. one of the best tarts i've ever had. all the other things i've tried all of them are pretty solid. things that were pretty average were the morning bun and their scones, but still pretty decent. honestly, you cannot go wrong here! when in doubt, any of the things first listed in it is section is pretty solid. also prepare to wait here! unless you come really early. there is often a line that can take anywhere from minutes before when you line up and when you pay for your order. also do not come too late because they usually run out of the best things early on."
104,Auriyon J.,1116,5,10/14/18,"ive tried so many things from them and they are all so yummy! the bread pudding is sooooo good! they also have super good brownies, chocolate cake and quiche ! i love this bakery so much!!!!!"
105,Jang N.,1116,5,10/10/18,the best bakery i have ever been to! it is the closest thing to bakeries i've had in france. i'm a huge fan of eclairs and they have the best eclairs i have ever tasted. i'm also a huge fan of croissants and they also had the best croissants. their morning bun is as good as advertised! their pies are also really good and their quiches are decent i'm usually do not like quiches . make sure you try the banana cream tart. super sweet but super delish! do not let the long lines fool ya it goes by pretty quickly
106,Katie Y.,1116,5,9/11/18,"wow. easily the best croissant i've ever had. the line was a bit ridiculous and it moves incredibly slow it was a saturday morning, so i think everyone had the same idea we had . i think we got a little carried away in attempting to essentially purchase almost one of every pastry, but it was well worth it. the quiche was delicious, you could tell that the crust was homemade and was cooked to perfection. the pastries were unbelievable, i expected they would be good but the croissants literally tasted like butter, while maintaining such a beautiful, flaky texture as someone who is baked croissants before, i have a much greater respect for people who do this well . the coffee was made at a separate counter and also did not disappoint. the shop is rather small, and some of the tables get in the way of the line, and the line gets in the way of utensil water area. i imagine it was not designed to handle the massive crowds that it attracts. wish they would take some of their profits and expand the place a little, because it is just not meant to handle the amount of people who visit their shop everyday. i also love that you can look into the kitchen in the back and watch the pastry chefs, live, make all the delicious food at the counter. highly recommend for a pastry and a coffee."
107,Justina L.,1116,3,8/10/18,"got the almond croissant, morning bun, corn quiche , freshly squeezed oj and americano for ~ . food was good but not necessarily something i would go out of my way and line up for."
108,Phil N.,1116,5,8/5/18,"in the footprint of iconic carls bakery lies tartine. tartine is a icon unto itself. the bakery goods at artfully detailed. however, unlike some, these beauties run deep with flavor. i have had most everything in the case at this point. all i can say, is pick your poison and you will not be disappointed. caution you order at the counter. there will be lines. you can expect to wait minutes but it is worth the wait. tables turn pretty quickly and it is a good idea to have a person in your party grab one as you enter the building. another tip. it is easy to go right to the cake case. however, , the croque monsieur, quiches ,and buttermilk scones are worth a try"
109,Mark W.,1116,4,7/5/18,"truly great pastries, sandwiches, quiche , pie, deserts, and coffee. it is not cheap but the quality is exceptional. the only downside is the line. i understand that people in sf are willing to wait for great food but there is never a line."
110,Molly M.,1116,3,7/5/18,"yes, its good. the quiche of all things! is one of my faves. as its all so nice and tasty, i try to go when there is no line and see what is left. never been disappointed. there are a mountain of bakeries in sf. and you are in the mission. so choose your calories. and come back when you can!"
111,Melody K.,1116,4,7/5/18,"the scent of freshly baked goods that hits you as soon as you walk in the door of tartine is seriously heaven! it does not smell overly and sickly sweet, but instead you get that bready, baked, homey smell that anyone who enjoys bread, pastries, and carbs in general would appreciate. lemon cream tart definitely worth trying! if i'm eating something with the words lemon and tart in it, that is exactly what i expect and that is exactly what i got! the crust was a little hard for my liking so it was difficult to cut with a fork, but overall my mouth was experiencing lemon heaven. the cream on the top is very light and complements the tart and thick lemon filling super well! chocolate souffle cake if you are a chocolate lover, then you have to get this. it is super rich, dense, and chocolatey what more could you ask for in a chocolate cake the dark chocolate ganache layer is aaamazing the bitterness balances out the sweetness of the whole cake. not to mention, the gold paper on top makes you feel super fancy! but if you enjoy more of a cakey texture, then this may not be the cake for you since it represents more of a souffle than a cake. tip this cake goes super well with a cup of coffee! croissant a must get! this was probably the priciest croissant i've ever paid for . for one croissant , but it is huge!! plus the outer flakiness, layered buttery goodness and mouthwatering aroma words cannot even describe, you just have to get it yourself to see exactly what i mean is definitely worth every penny. i've been here twice and each time i had to get their croissant. when you bite into it, the sound alone is to die for and would make for great asmr sound effects! next time i'm in the area, i definitely have to stop in to try their quiches , banana cream tart, and fruit tart!"
112,Falcon J.,1116,4,6/19/18,nice little cafe with great food. quiche and croque monsieur were both delicious. indoor and outdoor seating.
113,Amanda K.,1116,4,6/12/18,my first time trying quiche ~~ soft and delicious. fresh bakeries and dessert! unfortunately you have to wait in line quite a while it was monday am to order and not much space inside.
114,P. A.,1116,5,5/27/18,"fantastic breakfast. arrived around . am to quite a line just come prepared. it moved relatively quickly though, so do not despair. we got a morning bun, mushroom croque monsieur, quiche , and a savory scone. no regrets. the quiche was exceptional, and i loved the pickled carrots with the croque. our friends got the ham and cheese croissant and loved it. a guy said that if we decided to get another item we could just go up to the register and tell them we already paid so that we would not have to wait in the line again. he recommended the tarts to go. we might have to try it."
115,Nicole L.,1116,5,5/20/18,"tucked in the heart of the mission, this neighborhood bakery is not to be missed. i enjoyed a slice of chard & green garlic quiche and a macchiato, both made with love. cozy seating area perfect for sharing with new found friends. i also ordered a savory bacon frommage blanc scone to go. i've heard there can be a line out the door, do not hesitate for a moment to get in that queue."
116,J P.,1116,5,5/9/18,"their bread pudding is fantastic, so is there quiche and cake. the only thing that is not amazing is their chocolate chip cookie."
117,Arianna R.,1116,5,5/6/18,"omg. i do not expect any other quiche to live up to the ham and cheese quiche at tartine. it was perfect. get the morning bun. tartine tastes like france. it is amazing. expect a line, even if you arrive early. a friend and i came here at am on a sunday morning and there was already a line of people, but at least we were able to get a table when it opened at ."
118,Levi C.,1116,5,4/20/18,there is a lot of hype about restaurants in san francisco but i have to admit the tartine bakery lives up to it. actually they superseded my expectations. they make some of the flakiest croissants i've ever tasted. as a matter of fact they are on a whole other level of perfection and i have not even spoke about the banana cream pie or the quiche . go early to beat the lines and if you go during winter time bring your coat. they keep the doors wide open and it can get pretty cold if you are not prepared. seating is limited and you will share a space so make some new friends.
119,Tami N.,1116,5,3/29/18,"wow. just. wow. thought this was just going to be one of those overhyped places people stand in long lines to go into and order some pretty overpriced pastries just for the 'gram, but it is worth it. our uber dropped us off at about ish in the morning and there was a line outside the place. luckily i spied an open table in the tiny, crowded bakery and snatched it up right away while my brother and husband waited to order. we can debate whether or not that was the right thing to do, but it was chilly outside and we wanted to order coffee and bunch of stuff. yeah. they waited in line for about ish minutes and our sweet pastries were brought out first, with the quiches and croque monsieur coming out about minutes later. the pastries stole the show for sure. the morning bun and coconut tarts were just orgasmic. yes, all three of us moaned with each bite we took, eyes rolled to the back of our heads. thank god you are not in mn."
120,A P.,1116,4,3/23/18,"we landed here at about am on a saturday to a nontrivial line out onto the sidewalk that only got longer with time. we ended up purchasing a great variety of pastry, including a slice of ham and leek quiche , frangipane croissant, morning bun, pain au jambon hamandcheese croissant , gougere onion and cheese pastry , lemon cream tart, and banana cream tart per the many, many recommendations here . may have gotten a few more pastries i cannot recall. this was definitely not a cheap excursion. these pastries ran us north of , tax included. that said, most everything was good, and several were great. the gougere was a surprise hit, flaky, pungent with onion but not overpowering, and probably a good bet for vegetarians sorry vegans, i think they contain cheese . the quiche and hamandcheese croissant were both very solid. as i expected from reading the many reviews here, the banana cream tart was far and away the star of the show. deliciously pudding custardy texture not too sweet or too bland, but exactly right. i noticed they have full piesized banana cream tarts as well something to explore later, i think. sadly, the lemon tart was the biggest miss. bland and did not really have much lemon flavor. give it a pass. i did not find all pastries to be uniformly amazing, the prices were steep, and nobody enjoys waiting in line. if it were not for those issues, this place would have gotten stars from me. also, since this is the mission, there is no parking to be had either. i will probably be back sometime in future, but unless you are a local with time to kill standing around in line without having to worry about parking, this is not an everyday visit kind of place."
121,Sasha B.,1116,5,9/16/18,"a mustgo stop in san francisco. delicious pastries and coffee that goes perfectly with them. when you order in the morning, the pastries will come out first. if you order coffee, expect another minutes for it to come out. if you order a sandwich, it will likely come out another minutes after the coffee. so this is a dessert first place if you are asking me! the line is never ending. from minutes prior to opening, to when they close. their loaves of bread are ready for purchase around pm. basically, just get in line so that you will be at the counter around . that is my best suggestion. also. be prepared that when you get to the counter, they may be sold out of something. for pastries, we went twice this week and we tried a frangipane croissant , morning bun, buttermilk scone, savory scone, lemon cream tart, chocolate hazelnut tart. for coffee, we tried the valhrona mocha and cappuccino. the coffee was delicious, truly a craft coffee, and served at a temperature that is actually drinkable no worries about burning your tongue on the first sips . my favorite pastries were the frangipane croissant and the savory scone. try everything if you can! we also tried the idiazabal & membrillo sandwich and different loaves of bread ancient grain, porridge and walnut. the sandwich is like a gourmet grilled cheese. the bread truly makes the sandwiches here. you cannot go wrong with your selection. we took the loaves of bread back home to florida, and they are perfect for sandwiches, toast, snacks at home!"
122,Alex R.,1116,4,6/30/18,"i've waited years to come here and it did not disappoint! they were out of frangipane croissants bummer! but the double chocolate one held us over. great new matcha lattes! if you go, please get a rocher only . . changed my mind on the potential of meringues. also highly recommend the gougere! there was a line go early!!!!"
123,Winnie Y.,1116,4,5/15/18,"tartine bakery is another one of those places in sf with the lines wrapped around the block. i commend tartine for moving the line along fairly quickly and having copies of the menu available for people to look at so that they are ready to order once they are at the front. no extra charge for the carryout paper bag. lemon cream tart '' bold lemon flavor but excessively sweet make sure to spread the whipped cream over the entire tart because it will help balance out the sugary filling. possibly meant to shared between people. frangipane croissant almond cream tartine is quite generous with the cream, and they do a great job of spreading the cream evenly throughout the pastry instead of just putting a little smear at the center. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant excellent breakfast choice that was actually pretty big and filled me up. the saltiness from the ham and cheese was a little overpowering after a while, but it was still yummy! pain au chocolat chocolate croissant fairly plain with a touch of bittersweet chocolate, which showed off the flakiness of the crisp, buttery croissant . great choice if you are looking for something on the lighter and simpler side."
124,Kathryn T.,1116,4,3/27/18,"i happened to be up early on a monday and found myself in the mission district of sf. i heard about tartine before, so i decided to stop by with my boyfriend. we were lucky, the line was super short when we arrived! i guess normally the line is way longer, and it did get longer after we already got our pastries. i would recommend looking at the menu or more at yelp before you get to the front of the line, it is hard to see everything because the line kind of gets in the way. we ended up ordering the pain au jambon, frangipane croissant , and morning bun. i loved the morning bun, it was soft, sweet & citrusy, and so tasty! my boyfriend enjoyed the pain au jambon, the ham was super delicious. the frangipane croissant was good too, not too sweet. the outer croissant was a little hard, but the inside was soft, creamy, and almondy! this was a really nice bakery, i would stop by here again for a morning bun next time i'm in the area! and have some time to kill in a line."

126,Stephanie F.,1116,4,11/20/17,"ambience a cute little europeaninspired bakery that is around the corner from dolores park and is clearly well known for its breads and pastries. the line is well out the door, but was only about minutes or so on the sunday evening that i went. depending on the day, street parking is around the area, but as most places in the mission, it can definitely get crowded. making it inside, there was a sweet aroma of pastries, and a cozy bustling of baked goods and happy people! there were about three twoperson tables on one end of the store, and then a few larger tables for larger parties, or toshare tables. service was quick, sometimes a bit too quick, and friendly. food i got the morning bun, pain au chocolat, frangipane croissant , and the eversotasty ham and cheese croissant . all for alittle under approx. per pastry , these were a delectable, carby, sugary predinner meal. the morning bun was probably one of my favorite, a manylayered inverted croissant roll laminated with a sugary glaze, topped with sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest it was a perfect balance of sugary, moist yet crunchy goodness! another top seller for me was the ham and cheese croissant . so good, and such a wonderful contrast to all the sweet. the croissant was moist on the inside, with crunchy outer layers a great balance of ham and cheese on the inside and also made you feel like there was some nutrition with the sliver of protein. then came the pain au chocolat and frangipane which were both flakey croissant goodness as well. the chocolate croissant had a % cocoa chocolate on the inside which would have tasted so much better if it was warmed up. the frangipane was a lighter croissant and a tad on the dry side but did have an amazing brandy soaked layer on the inside that was then topped with frangipane cream an aromatic mix of butter, sugar, pastry cream, slivered almonds, and brandy . i will definitely be coming back to try out the paninis though, they were made with amazing looking bread and smelled . indescribable haha! overall, a good experience, solid stars cannot go without that morning bun and ham & cheese croissant !"
127,Sara L.,1116,5,9/22/17,"i have not been to france, so i cannot say the croissants are better, but the frangipane croissant was damn fantastic. i'm not sure what the whiny people are so hung up about the 'wait' or the 'line', they probably go at mid day with.everyone else. i went about an hour after they opened, smiling friendly staff quickly filled my order and i was out in no time, probably not even minutes. was a perfect experience and i cannot wait to go back!"
128,Alex S.,1116,5,8/14/17,"had to try this place given the positive reviews. it totally holds up. it is a small spot that surprisingly held everyone eating, ordering and waiting in line which wound out the door on a monday morning . i waited for maybe min really not that bad. but it did not have a touristy feel. most people in line seemed to be locals. the service was quick and helpful. i had the frangipane croissant and a cafe au lait. easily the best croissant i've ever had. big and super filling. incredibly flaky, but not dry. filled with a delicious almond filling and and topped with more tasty almond slivers. the cafe au lait was so good too. no extra cream or sugar needed. served in a big soup bowl that requires both hands to drink. both super simple and refined yet packed with flavor. i wish i lived in the area i would come back so many more times to try everything else that also looked amazing. this is a must in sf."
129,Aries X.,1116,5,8/13/17,"jesus. i've never seen so many people lining and waiting for almost an hour for pastries. you smell the cream and sugar when you walk close to the bakery. their most popular pastry is frangipane croissant . its almond flakes and almond cream gives it a moist and crispy texture, very very unique. they do have bread most popular is country after am, although that is not what most people come for. tartine has sourdough books published and are seen as advanced baking bibles in the baking industry."
130,Anthony P.,1116,5,7/28/17,"a memorable moment in the disney cartoon film ratatouille was when colette tatou shows linguini how to tell if a loaf of bread is good without ever tasting it. it is not the smell, it is not the look, but the sound, she tells him, crushing a loaf between her fingers. this statement cemented my dogmatic belief in selecting if bread is good or not. whether it is pastries, loaves, or any other baked goods, i took this opinion as a matter for my own tasting pleasure. before arriving in san francisco, i was recommended to visit tartine by a fellow classmate in my summer philosophy class. you have to go to tartine! she kept reminding me. finally, after so much determination on her part, i decided to take on her suggestion when visiting the city after summer semester ended. apart from getting lost in the mission district due to my gps app making me walk in the wrong direction, eventually i was able to find my way to the bakery. upon entering the establishment, i was taken aback from the smells, the sounds, and the many people that were crammed into this small space. going up to the counter, i asked the person helping me what he would recommend to a firsttime customer. something sweet and something savory was what i asked of him. he kindly recommended for me their ham and cheese croissant for the savory option and their frangipane croissant with almond cream for the sweet. along with the two, i also picked out their bread pudding because it looked so enticing sitting among the many other treats in display. all three treats along with a small coffee totaled about , which i took with a grain of salt being san francisco, but i can tell you the quality and tastes of the ingredients are very much worth the prices that are set. sitting down with my savory croissant and coffee, i took colette tatou's tip of choosing bread to the test, delicately pressing my fingers on the treat as the pastry crunched to the pressure. my expectations were met and i ripped a piece off, exposing the salty ham and melted cheese that were inside. it was obvious that this was not any ordinary croissant , with each layer being flakier than the next. the middle was soft and spongy, having a airy texture on the palette. it was a great pairing with the hot coffee to wash it down. overall, this is an excellent bakery you would not want to miss whether you live in the city or a passerby on the way to dolores park. the staff is genuinely helpful and the product they make is worth every cent."
131,Bryan H.,1116,5,7/15/17,"arguably the best bakery in san francisco. usually a line out the door at any hour of the day, but do not let it put you off as the line moves along at a decent pace. everything is good, but the coconut cream pie is my favorite. they line the pastry she will with dark chocolate before filling so the crust does not get soggy. same with the banana cream pie. lemon tart, frangipane croissant and cookies are great too. croque monsieur if you want something savory. parking in the area sucks, so take muni if you can. you can always get it to go and go to dolores park just a few blocks away."
132,Esther Y.,1116,4,4/23/17,"decent pastries!! a little over priced, but they are worth trying if it is your first time. always a long line, so make sure to go early. i went around am and there was still a line. i got the . frangipane croissant almond croissant . . . tbh it just tasted like a normal croissant , but a little better. it was super hard to eat, i spilled crumbs all over. . savory scone . not bad. i expected it to be very savory, but it was more bready and the flavor was not strong. . ."
133,Maria B.,1116,5,1/4/17,"tartine is worth the wait minutes to be exact! . the french country loaf was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. it was warm and delicious when we ripped into it. the butter added on is nice, but certainly not necessary. great surprise. the pastries were as expected delicious. the almond frangipane croissant was stellar, and the pain au chocolat did not disappoint. we also bought four tarts for my birthday, to be consumed three days later. wow. we were amazed at how well they kept up considering the moisture in the tarts. the crusts were perfect in all four. i highly recommend the banana cream, frangipane , lemon, and hazelnut chocolate. all were shared between four of us. we all felt fulfilled. my favorites if the four are the lemon and banana cream. yum."
134,Miko B.,1116,5,12/21/16,"have you ever seen that meme from futurama where fry yells, shut up and take my money! while waving a handful of cash that is literally how i feel every time i step into tartine. because my apartment is only a few blocks away, this is actually very dangerous. almost as dangerous as cliff jumping or shark diving. except i go like once a week. so yeah. sometimes, i just feel like i deserve a pat on the back for being such a daredevil, you know morning bun . stars the perfect marriage of a classic croissant and a cinnamon roll, this pastry is what tartine is best known for. think of a flaky croissant dough that is been rolled up and topped with sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest. these will be sold out come afternoon though a blessing in disguise since they are best eaten fresh. banana cream tart . for for stars i've always been a sucker for banana flavored pastries, and this one is no different. the bananas are ripe, the cream is succulent, the tart is flaky. perfectly balanced out with thin slivers of bitter dark chocolate. croissant . stars the first thing you realize about a tartine croissant is its ginormous size. the second is the dark brown exterior, almost to the point of being burnt. do not worry though this means it is more flavorful. the moment you hear that crunch and crackle while digging your teeth into this treat, you know you are in for a good time. chocolate eclair . stars a standard eclair that is excellently done. packed with vanilla cream and glazed with luscious valhrona chocolate. pure decadence. frangipane croissant . stars tartine's rendition of the almond croissant is filled with frangipane cream, which is composed of brandy syrup, pastry cream, and almonds. to finish, it is topped with powdered sugar and more crunchy almonds. ham quiche . stars a solid savory option to balance out all the sugar. the body of this quiche is light and silky. i'm pretty sure they use the same crust here as the banana cream tart so good. bread pudding . small . large stars served piping hot, the bread pudding was my least favorite of the bunch. although i did enjoy the tartness of the fruits, i thought the pudding itself was too mushy. this offputting texture made it feel like i was eating scrambled eggs."
135,E G.,1116,5,10/21/16,"the gold standard. favorites are the ham and cheese and frangipane croissants , the morning bun, the eclair, the passionfruit coconut cake and the shortbread. and the bananacream tart! and the turkeybroccoli rabe sandwich. and the country bread. oof it is fantastic. worth the line and the occasional customerservice miss . if you are visiting for the first time there are laminated menus in a stack by the door as you edge your way in. if no tables are free as is most often the case take your pastries to nearby dolores park!"
136,L L.,1116,2,6/26/16,"for a bakery with thousands of reviews and an average of stars, i'm quite puzzled by the lack of consistency. as someone who does not live in sf, i had happily waited or minutes and happily paid for an almost croissant . the plan was to save the croissant to enjoy on my flight back home. when i was actually on the flight and the carb craving hit, i smiled slyly to myself, thinking that i would get to polish off a flakey, buttery frangipane croissant while everyone else ate tiny mass produced pretzels. well, the croissant was burnt. the croissant was in the oven too long or the heat was too high or something. the entire outer . cm circumference of the croissant was brown. and as i stared at it, i recalled the image of the stack of croissants at the tartine counter. the entire display had croissants as dark as the one i was picking apart, trying to salvage it and eating the middle layers only. that thought actually made me more than disappointed since it meant they were selling a tray full of burnt pastries to customers without caring about the quality of today's batch. were they thinking they would not need to care about being good every day they do have enough loyalty and branding built in that yelp review does not matter. but tartine, i made my friend wait with me in that line, with the sun shining at us the entire time. and the end result was just an overpriced, low quality item."
137,Thiago F.,1116,3,4/20/16,"i bought basically everything the bakery had. it is just that after waiting under the sun for a halfblock line and the place's price i expected more. i was looking for things to satiate my sweet tooth but in the end nothing but the morning bun was as sweet as i wanted them to be and was by far the best thing i tasted from there. other than that the frangipane croissant was good could have been really good if i used butter or anything else on it, like a jam, peanut butter or nutella and both the banana cream tart and the frangipane tart were ok. the bread pudding barely had any taste the double pain au chocolat was not good even on the chocolate parts which it barely had the hazelnut chocolate tart was very light in flavor, basically and weirdly not sweet was not satisfying, just felt like a placeholder the cookie was just meh , i have eaten better from supermarkets the chocolate rye bar barely had any sweetness in the chocolate and in the meringue not satisfying and not even a pleasant flavor and came with a crazy sweet and flavored jam that was basically all i could feel whenever i took a bite that had it. it honestly felt like i was drinking orange essence or orange perfume. i do not get the hype and i do not plan on waiting on that line again. i may go back earlier much earlier! for a morning bun if it is on my way and i want to show it to someone visiting me."
138,Aaron C.,1116,3,3/23/16,"perhaps i'm just not a big pastry person or i did not order the right things, but it did not seem significantly better than other bakeries. we got the frangipane croissant and the gougere. they were good but i was not blown away considering the wait."
139,Jhonna R.,1116,4,3/9/16,"be prepared to wait in line, but the payoff is delicious. staff is super nice and keeps up with the fast pace. you do not even notice the wait if you are in line with your friends, but just because it lines up out past the door, down the street.i taketh a star. the three of us shared frangipane croissants morning bun pain au chocolat currant buttermilk scone counter culture coffee will make you wake up wishing you had one every morning"
140,Ana G.,1116,5,2/19/16,"i love everything i've ever had hereits my dessert happy place . the passionfruit coconut cake is my absolute favorite. it has light layers of sponge cake with a passionfruitlime filling and large flakes of coconut on top which resemble feathers on top of the cake. my second favorite is the coconut cream tart that has a layer of chocolate lining the bottom of the crust. the morning buns, brownies, eclairs, bread pudding, openfaced sandwiches are all great. oftentimes when you purchase a coconut macaroon from a bakery its a bit stale, but tartine's are always fresh with a light lemon taste too. my friend and i adore the frangipane croissants they are so rich, even eating half of one can be too much. its my absolute favoritecannot say enough about it!"
141,b t.,1116,2,10/20/18,"i'm a big fan of the tartine book and have baked beautiful breads from that book. so i grabbed the opportunity to go to the bakery while in sf. waited mins in line on saturday at pm and another mins to get my spicy turkey sandwich with broccoli rabe. to my utter disappointment, the sandwich was like eating mush encased in hard pressed greasy bread. you could not taste the turkey , or any distinct flavors. as strangers who shared my table said, it was like broccoli soup on your sandwich without knowing its broccoli. they had sadly ordered the same sandwich. i guess making great bread does not automatically mean you make great sandwiches."
142,Oliver S.,1116,4,4/27/18,"tartine does all the things a bakery should do, offering pastries, bread, sandwiches, coffee and more in a corner spot in the mission. there will be a line out the door even if you go midday during the week, but it is worth waiting at least once to experience this institution. many people enjoy the breads, which can be purchased by the loaf. you may also enjoy such items as morning bun, muffin, croissant, cappuccino, or frangipane tart. that one has been my favorite. surely you will see something as you wait to order that will make you say, i will get one of the ] when it is your turn. i'm a fan of the pastrami and spicy turkey sandwiches, though they are not quick. in sum, you will wait half an hour for some of the best bakery items you have ever tried, and you will pay quite a premium for doing so. what would cost you . and maybe a minute at the town bakery in bottineau, nd will run . plus wait time here. your call."
143,Allison J.,1116,5,1/11/18,"when there is always a line out the door and around the corner, you know they are doing something right! while you wait, the aromas of delicious baked good are constantly being wafted to you, tempting you with every step you take. but i guarantee that when you take that final step and walk away with your bag i recommend bags of pastries & croissants & sandwiches, it will all be worth it! below, i have documented all of our food for my own personal referencing, but when you go, just order whatever speaks to you! you cannot be led astray, because everything is good. but definitely do not walk in and order one thing. you waited for this. you earned this. get like pastries and sandwiches and then take a nap. pastries pain au chocolat chocolate croissant crispy outer pastry and stuffed with delicious chocolate pain au jambon smoked ham & gruyere croissant the effing best thing there! cheese and ham are smokey, savory, salty & that yummy croissant does it again crispy, yet soft . gougere this delicious light, puffy bread thing with gruyere cheese, pepper & thyme is again amazing morning bun basically a cinnamon bun, but better! even this nonsweet tooth loved this hot pressed sandwiches they take about additional minutes, but once again was worth the wait. spicy turkey the second best thing there! perfect panini with turkey , provolone and the most scrumptious & spicy broccoli rabe pesto! jambon royale & gruyere still great, but seriously stick with the spicy turkey . this ham & cheese is amazing, but still just a ham & cheese."
144,Lindsey C.,1116,5,12/22/17,"so, my first visit a few years ago to tartine was a doozy. i got some bakery items i probably should not have and then a car rammed into my bike that was locked up a few steps down the street. not a good day. however, i've been back and now finally get the oooh and ahhh. maybe they ramped up morning bun production on the weekends or i just got lucky but i came around noon pm on a saturday and they still had plenty. of course i got one, they are a must get for a reason, and a spicy turkey sandwich. damn. both were incredible. the morning bun was still soft and fluffy on the inside, flaky on the outside touch of orange came through nicely. the turkey sandwich was a beast and a delicious one at that. i'm a huge fan of tartine bread , best in the sf bay area especially their oat porridge , but now i'm good with the bakery. just. steer clear of the dry chocolate chunk cookie and gougere."
145,Danny C.,1116,4,8/23/17,"tartine, you are definitely growing on me. yes, it is still hipster. yes, the lines are still long. yes, a sea salt chocolate chip cookie is . you know all that and more. what you should also know is that food quality has not decreased even though prices have. croissants are still buttery, flaky, and multilayered, the bread pudding is still decadent, and sandwiches are made with fresh country bread before being pressed to perfection get the spicy turkey with broccoli rabe pesto and provolone you will thank me later . you will definitely fight for a seat and wait in line for a while, but the baked goods still rock. are the baguettes as good as keller's definitely not, but a close second."
146,Justin W.,1116,5,7/24/17,"wow, so good! but a little out of price range for regular visits on an unemployed budget. my friend and i came in for an afternoon snack, drawn in by the captivating aroma, and ended up spending + tip on two cold brew coffees and a spicy turkey sandwich. window shopping here is no good either you will definitely be tempted by literally any of the beautiful pastries at the counter. we asked for our snack to go to enjoy in dolores park, and our sandwich was cheerfully brought out about minutes later. the cold brew was fine, but in my opinion, it is kind of hard to mess up cold brew. the hefty sandwich oozed out cheese and pesto and was the perfect amount of spicy . the bread was perfectly golden, crusty, and crispy. even the carrot that came with the sandwich was unique, with a spicy and vinegary taste. definitely coming back for another snack in the future!"
147,Jon S.,1116,5,4/13/17,"pesto spicy turkey sandwich is to die for. coffee and chocolate was literally cold but it is ok. my order was all messed up still ok coz food is fuc,. amazing"
148,Dominique G.,1116,5,3/15/17,"as tourists we followed the places that had lines out the door. so glad we did! the line went by fast so do not let it stop you! for lunch we shared a spicy turkey sandwich still filling and sooo good! the lady at the counter knew we were tourists so she suggested the banana cream tart, then accidentally dropped a lemon cream tart in its box and gave that to us for free! both were amazing! i cannot tell you which was better. we sat outside and people watched while we enjoyed it all and the weather was amazing."
149,Michelle S.,1116,2,9/27/16,"the place is ok for their bread. not so sure about their dessert options or sandwiches. the chocolate eclair was dry with not enough cream inside. the banana cream tart was too sweet for my palate. overall the desserts are americanized style desserts. i should have expected this, but i think i was led to believe it would be more french style based on the name and reputation. oh well. the sandwich lacked a bit of seasoning. i got the spicy turkey and it was not spicy at all. on the plus side, the portions were huge. i waited + minutes on a saturday. i do not think i would want to repeat that experience. the bread used in the sandwich was decent though, so maybe i will come back for their baguettes."
150,Garrett A.,1116,3,11/14/15,"decent paninis. i went on a weekend and there definitely was a long line. it moved fairly efficiently and it is definitely clear this place has a reputation. i got the spicy turkey which was great. the bread was fresh and i really enjoyed the spicy kick in the brocolli pesto. and the sandwich was a very big size and a great value for the price. it is nice they have some inside and outside seating, though do not expect you will be able to sit. if you want to check this place out, plan extra time for the wait."
151,Amy M.,1116,5,9/20/15,"your mouth first meets the calculated, crisp country bread and soon arrive at the soft chewy interior that envelopes peppered turkey and a unique broccoli pesto. that is the spicy turkey . just wait in the line. it will all be worth it."
152,Amanda W.,1116,5,9/19/15,"forever a fan. lover of the company ever since purchasing one of their cookbooks years ago. do not let the line deter you. it is gone in minutes, and you can drool over the kitchen through the window, and then have ample time to read the menu and pick your pastries we have ordered the spicy turkey , jambon royale & gruyere and the three cheese tasting. all wonderful, all pricey, but all huge servings. i always have half as leftovers for my next meal. sweets wise, i highly recommend the almond rochers and the lemon cream tart. the banana creme tart and eclair are also wonderful. the lemon meringue cake, tastes good, but i'm a textures person. steer clear if you do not like cakes that have soaked up syrups creams similar to a tres leches cake. opposite of a fluffy, airy cake, very dense ."
153,Conor M.,1116,5,5/24/15," in arguably the best bakery in san francisco proper. sandwiches are amazing i'm partial to the spicy turkey , the pastries are top notch croissant, pain au chocolat, banana cream tart etc. , and the coffee is very good not great or the best, but up there enough to make this place your onestopshop for breakfast snack coffee with a pastry or treat. long lines early morning when pastries are out and fresh, and on weekends. wait can be min plus."
154,Teresa D.,1116,4,8/29/14,"we had heard how great the food was,so we tried it out and it was definitely worth the waiting in line! the spicy turkey sandwich was incredible!! the bread,so buttery and crisp, almost steals the show from the yummy pesto and melted cheeses inside! yum! sadly,the girl at the point of checkout was cold rude not just to me,but to everyone. the guys were definitely the more pleasant people on staff. even though the wait is long,the food is well worth it. the coconut cream tart was amazing,too!"
155,Jess Y.,1116,2,7/21/14,"i dislike that i am giving only stars. my sister had been here before and loves their tres leches cake. the line was long so my sister waited in line while i found parking. things looked tasty. but the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie was completely burned. the coconut macaroons were completely burned. i did not taste these or look at them until i had already left the place. burnt chocolate does not taste well whatsoever. the gal at the register has a serious attitude problem. no smile on her face and super rude. i understand you are really busy but that does not mean you can be a bitch. we also ordered a spicy turkey sandwich and two slices of tres leches cake. the cake was okay but my sister said it had a funny taste to it. it did not taste as fresh as it should have. it just did not seem like they cared. i understand that they are one out of bakeries to visit and that they have stellar reviews, but my experience just was not there."
156,Juliana K.,1116,5,4/26/14,"i cannot believe it took me so long to finally try tartine. if . stars and over reviews does not convince you to wait in line for tartine, hopefully my review will. the line is always very long for this place, usually out the door and wrapping around the corner. however, it goes by pretty fast, and it is definitely worth the wait. we decided to use the yelp highlights to guide our decisionmaking at tartine trust me, with all those mouthwatering pastries in front of you, it can be quite hard to decide what you want . as far as savory foods, i tried the spicy turkey sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe pesto. it was one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. every single ingredient was perfect, the crispy bread, the melted provolone, the spicy turkey , and the flavorful pesto. now, on to the sweet stuff we tried the morning bun, the bread pudding, and the banana creme tart yes, all the yelp highlights . they were all beyond stars, however if i had to choose my favorite, it would probably be the banana creme tart, but that is just a personal preference. if you are up for it, i would just get all of them and then walk it off later! tartine is well worth the wait, and calories! d"
157,Nikki G.,1116,4,2/23/14,"i had a lemon tart, it was so good. creamy, perfect. line took about minutes on a sunday, and i got lucky and managed to snag a table. i also had the spicy turkey pesto sandwich. got to, say, it was not as incredible as i thought it would be. the turkey did not taste as fresh as i was expecting. however, the pastry was great, i cannot wait to go back for more."
158,Sylvia N.,1116,4,2/18/14,"do not be discouraged by the long line surprisingly, it moves fairly quickly. the staff is incredibly great with getting orders in & out as fast as they can. spicy turkey & broccoli pesto sandwich just okay. unfortunately, the sandwich is pretty oily & lacks a fresh ingredient to cut through the buttery oiliness. maybe fresh tomatoes would be a good addition it comes with a pickled carrot, but i do not think it is enough. ham & cheese quiche by far, the best quiche i've ever had! love the flaky crust they use instead of the usual pie crust. i do not know if i was just unlucky but the size of the slice was a little bit on the small side. banana cream tart the banana cream tart is delicious & you can tell the ingredients are pretty fresh. but i have to say, i was a little disappointed. maybe i expected too much, but for i expected something amazing. to be honest, you might get more bang for your buck at nation's both costwise & tastewise . almond frangipane this was a unique little pastry dessert but again, nothing amazing. the service is here is just mediocre. i love that they are fast, but i do not think friendliness & great hospitality should sacrifice at the cost of quick service. overall, the desserts are unique & are pretty tasty. i love the quiche. but will i come back i'm not too sure. maybe one day, when i do not care about money & do not mind dropping big chunks of cash on teeny tiny portions of dessert."
159,Monica P.,1116,3,2/2/14,so i came here because i watched that food network special on netflix recently showcasing at as the best place to get a croissant outside of france. the bakery's tres leches cake was divine. the spicy turkey sandwich was delicious but not star flavor. there was a really nice girl helping me when i placed my order for croissants and two desserts. then i met this blonde tall guy with a total attitude behind the register. i paid . for all my food and topped it off with a small tip. he looked at it and did not even say thank you. how rude. he asked if i was staying or going and i said i wanted sandwich for here and other stuff later. i asked him about seating and he says it is hard to get. i looked around and hoovered a few minutes but it was super packed. i went back and tried to change my whole order to go. he told me i would have to hold onto my heavy table number and stick it in my bag i'm sorry but what is this guy smoking the manager was there and was thankfully like no you do not have to carry the pound table number around for mins while waiting for your sandwich. thanks. so i return in mins my sandwich is plated. ok so i play dumb and just eat it there. it was so so. i finish up and ask where my other stuff is. they say i never paid for it. really how about asking me if i paid or not instead of telling me that they do not believe me. i had to pull up my bank statement for them to even look in the system i was pissed. then they scrolled for about mins finding nothing until that other snooty guy came up and insisted in a very unfriendly way i gave you your stuff. the girl behind him who had put it away was shaking her head like no he did not. i told him look i came from la to eat here and this is just a mess. he did not even apologize and was rude again saying he was trying to fix it the manager had skedaddled and was not paying attention. overall it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. on the food network show it portrays the owners as people who are salt of the earth with real passion. i do not think that attitude transfers to their staff
160,Maki K.,1116,4,1/26/14,"if you are reading this while waiting in line, do not leave out of frustration! this place is worth the wait! there is hope. we came on a sunny saturday afternoon around pm and waited about min to get through the line. our party of shared a bunch of things. we loved the spicy turkey hot pressed sandwich delicious pesto with yummy gooey melted cheese and the turkey actually has a kick that hits you at the end. morning bun deliciously covered with cinnamon sugar on the outside. it is flaky and crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. i like the subtle hint of lemon you taste with this too. lemon poppyseed tea cake the texture is wonderful and the flavor is delicate and delicious. the outer layer has a crust that is lightly crispy with moist cake in the center. banana cream tart yum! the flaky pastry bottom has a layer of chocolate! the pretty good stuff croque monsieur not bad, but i think the spicy turkey is better. i heard you can get a fried egg on this sandwich though if you ask for it. sopressata, fontina, broccoli rabe pesto hot pressed sandwich pretty yummy, but i personally liked the spicy turkey better. mexican wedding cookies crispy texture that was not too sweet. chocolate rye cookie interesting that this is made out of rye. it was not overly sweet, which i appreciated. you could really taste the dark chocolate in this cookie. and the meh bread pudding one of my friends liked it, but i thought it was too eggy and soggy. i've had better elsewhere. the hot pressed sandwiches are huge! there are pieces that come in one order. i could only finish out of the pieces b c i wanted to save room for dessert and coffee! it will make a yummy future leftover dinner i also got an iced latte which was pretty good and balanced well with the sweets! as for seating, if you see a seat, grab it! of us stayed in line while the other person in our party went to save a seat that had opened up. would love to come back to pick up a loaf of freshly baked bread or to try some other baked goodies. my mom would love this place!"
161,Kevin N.,1116,5,10/24/18,"do yourself a favor a take a day off work and treat yo self with some delicious food from tartine. the line is totally worth it, but if you want to avoid the hassle, try to come on a weekday. the place itself is pretty small. if you have a large party, do not expect to be seated. they have a few tables inside and then three tables outside. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant. must get. morning bun sweet and delicious. the orange really comes through the whole bun and not just the outside quiche i've never had a quiche this perfect before. the egg is the perfect soft consistency sourdough take a giant loaf home. so tasty and will last you a while"
162,Ace C.,1116,5,8/22/18,"hands down the most delicious pastries i've ever had! we got the pain au jambon , morning bun, lemon tart, banana cream tart. everything was absolutely delicious and i've never had a lemon tart so perfectly balanced before. tangy and sweet, balanced by the unsweetened cream dollop on top, sitting on a flaky yet dense tart crust. i'm in love and wish i lived in sf just for this bakery! only downside is that the place is very crowded and the line can easily wrap around the building. we ended up sitting outside which was alright given the weather."
163,Wendy R.,1116,4,7/28/18,"we finally made it to tartine. i had expected the experience to be more intimidating and the cafe to be larger wrong on both accounts. we got there a few minutes after opening on a saturday and waited about minutes in line. i've seen a lot of people complain about the long lines, so i'm not sure if we got lucky or if those people are just impatient. we both got a morning bun and a pain au jambon . both were delicious, and now i know what the description shatteringly crisp means. i also got a fresh grapefruit juice, which was probably the best i've ever had. i could not finish the croissant, but i powered through the bun. the cafe is tiny, and the prices are a bit steep, but i would say it is definitely worth a trip."
164,Winnie Y.,1116,4,5/15/18,"tartine bakery is another one of those places in sf with the lines wrapped around the block. i commend tartine for moving the line along fairly quickly and having copies of the menu available for people to look at so that they are ready to order once they are at the front. no extra charge for the carryout paper bag. lemon cream tart '' bold lemon flavor but excessively sweet make sure to spread the whipped cream over the entire tart because it will help balance out the sugary filling. possibly meant to shared between people. frangipane croissant almond cream tartine is quite generous with the cream, and they do a great job of spreading the cream evenly throughout the pastry instead of just putting a little smear at the center. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant excellent breakfast choice that was actually pretty big and filled me up. the saltiness from the ham and cheese was a little overpowering after a while, but it was still yummy! pain au chocolat chocolate croissant fairly plain with a touch of bittersweet chocolate, which showed off the flakiness of the crisp, buttery croissant. great choice if you are looking for something on the lighter and simpler side."
165,Julia M.,1116,5,4/19/18,this review is for the pain au jambon with jalapeno. i came here for a snack with a friend i would heard too much about this place to pass it by. the line was intimidating but it ended up only taking us about min to get to the front ~ pm on a saturday . the pastry was absolutely amazing. i highly recommend getting something to go and eating out at dolores park if the weather is nice.
166,Kathryn T.,1116,4,3/27/18,"i happened to be up early on a monday and found myself in the mission district of sf. i heard about tartine before, so i decided to stop by with my boyfriend. we were lucky, the line was super short when we arrived! i guess normally the line is way longer, and it did get longer after we already got our pastries. i would recommend looking at the menu or more at yelp before you get to the front of the line, it is hard to see everything because the line kind of gets in the way. we ended up ordering the pain au jambon , frangipane croissant, and morning bun. i loved the morning bun, it was soft, sweet & citrusy, and so tasty! my boyfriend enjoyed the pain au jambon , the ham was super delicious. the frangipane croissant was good too, not too sweet. the outer croissant was a little hard, but the inside was soft, creamy, and almondy! this was a really nice bakery, i would stop by here again for a morning bun next time i'm in the area! and have some time to kill in a line."
167,A P.,1116,4,3/23/18,"we landed here at about am on a saturday to a nontrivial line out onto the sidewalk that only got longer with time. we ended up purchasing a great variety of pastry, including a slice of ham and leek quiche, frangipane croissant, morning bun, pain au jambon hamandcheese croissant , gougere onion and cheese pastry , lemon cream tart, and banana cream tart per the many, many recommendations here . may have gotten a few more pastries i cannot recall. this was definitely not a cheap excursion. these pastries ran us north of , tax included. that said, most everything was good, and several were great. the gougere was a surprise hit, flaky, pungent with onion but not overpowering, and probably a good bet for vegetarians sorry vegans, i think they contain cheese . the quiche and hamandcheese croissant were both very solid. as i expected from reading the many reviews here, the banana cream tart was far and away the star of the show. deliciously pudding custardy texture not too sweet or too bland, but exactly right. i noticed they have full piesized banana cream tarts as well something to explore later, i think. sadly, the lemon tart was the biggest miss. bland and did not really have much lemon flavor. give it a pass. i did not find all pastries to be uniformly amazing, the prices were steep, and nobody enjoys waiting in line. if it were not for those issues, this place would have gotten stars from me. also, since this is the mission, there is no parking to be had either. i will probably be back sometime in future, but unless you are a local with time to kill standing around in line without having to worry about parking, this is not an everyday visit kind of place."
168,Corinna T.,1116,4,2/16/18," . stars the pastries are truly exceptional and above average here, and they know it! the line is always out the door, and i've never tried to stand in it until last weekend. i will definitely be back if i'm in the neighborhood. i tried pain au jambon a large, flakey croissant with applewood smoked ham and gruvere cheese croque monsieur turkey a warm and buttery sandwich with turkey and cheese both were delicious! and shareable i loved the warm texture of the croque monsieur, and the pain au jambon , the croissant was so unique and different than anything i've ever tried. i want to come back and try the banana cream tart and morning bun everyone talks about!"
169,Allison J.,1116,5,1/11/18,"when there is always a line out the door and around the corner, you know they are doing something right! while you wait, the aromas of delicious baked good are constantly being wafted to you, tempting you with every step you take. but i guarantee that when you take that final step and walk away with your bag i recommend bags of pastries & croissants & sandwiches, it will all be worth it! below, i have documented all of our food for my own personal referencing, but when you go, just order whatever speaks to you! you cannot be led astray, because everything is good. but definitely do not walk in and order one thing. you waited for this. you earned this. get like pastries and sandwiches and then take a nap. pastries pain au chocolat chocolate croissant crispy outer pastry and stuffed with delicious chocolate pain au jambon smoked ham & gruyere croissant the effing best thing there! cheese and ham are smokey, savory, salty & that yummy croissant does it again crispy, yet soft . gougere this delicious light, puffy bread thing with gruyere cheese, pepper & thyme is again amazing morning bun basically a cinnamon bun, but better! even this nonsweet tooth loved this hot pressed sandwiches they take about additional minutes, but once again was worth the wait. spicy turkey the second best thing there! perfect panini with turkey, provolone and the most scrumptious & spicy broccoli rabe pesto! jambon royale & gruyere still great, but seriously stick with the spicy turkey. this ham & cheese is amazing, but still just a ham & cheese."
170,Mary P.,1116,3,1/3/18,"i had wanted to visit this bakery in a previous visit to san francisco, but timing just never lined up. i'm a sucker for high end french pastries, and these made my mouth water looking at them online. unfortunately, because of the location, i could not get to the bakery until later in the day, so options were limited. what we did and could get was delicious, but i would definitely want to do this in the morning if i were to go again. i managed to get rochers which were these meringue clouds with cacao nibs yum. i also got a pain au jambon and pain au chocolate, one of the better croissants i've had in a long time. perfect, airy, buttery, just the way they should be a for those alone. there were quite a few sketchy characters in the bakery when we visited around pm, and having to almost climb over a homeless man who decided to camp out in the middle of the bakery was a bit of a buzz kill. we took our pastries to go, and had them back at the hotel. i was actually hoping to sit down and relax at the bakery and enjoy our pastries, oh well."
171,Bradford L.,1116,3,12/23/17,"for the price i'm paying and the minute wait, i expected a bit more. we ordered the pain au jambon , lemon cream tart, and chocolate hazelnut tart. pain au jambon pretty good, but expensive and not special lemon cream tart probably my favorite, but it could be considered pretty tart to others chocolate hazelnut tart rather disappointing, it was bland and surprisingly, did not have much chocolate flavor i might try this place again if there was not such a long wait, but most likely, i will be looking elsewhere to fill my pastry needs."
172,Vanessa M.,1116,4,9/25/17,"when i knew i was going to visit my gf in sf, i yelped around for bakeries, and remember there was a popular french bakery that was raved about in sf. i yelped around and right knew it had to be tartine since it had over , reviews. and yes the pictures were just the type of patisserie i was looking for. i was worried at first because i knew there would be a long crazy line but luckily when we went it was not that bad. i liked the atmosphere, small, but cozy and quaint. simple and clean. i was overwhelmed because everything looked so good and i wanted it all! i came here twice since first time they were out of a few things and i wanted to come earlier and really get the full experience. _frangipane tart . flaky pastry she will, almond cream with seasonal fruit. this was the first thing i got when i came here, even though my heart wanted the banana cream tart. it looked good, but taste wise was a let down. it tasted average, and a bit try. not as flaky or buttery and did not have much flavor besides just almond. the fruit was i believe some type of berry. maybe blueberry or boysenberry, which was not that sweet and the flavors did not really come through. for the price, this was not worth it at all. _banana cream tart . chocolate and caramel coated flaky pastry. because i was disappointed with the tart above, i decided to just follow my heart and go for the banana cream tart. it was huge so i originally was afraid to eat it all by myself, since my gf cannot have too much sweets, but i'm on vacay so f it! so glad i ended up getting this, because it was the best banana cream tart i've had. actually i never had a banana cream tart, just pie. the crust is more buttery, flaky and thickthe bananas were fresh, and they added a good amount. the cream was a good ration and not too sweet. the caramel inside was subtle and not too sweet but balanced the other flavors. the chocolate inside seemed dark and rich. now this is worth the price! the chocolate shavings were amazing as well. a must! _pain au chocolate chocolate croissant i came back second day for this but took this home with me back to la. i put it in the toaster oven and it was still good. this is a double chocolate croissant, so more chocolate. the chocolate seemed semi dark and a bit more rich and bold than milk chocolate. it was good, but chocolate croissant you can get anywhere, this is good if you just want that sweet pastry. _morning bun . cinnamon sugar, candied orange. a man in front of me said i had to get this, and i'm so glad i did. this was my other fave and a must! it tasted like a cinnamon roll, from the sugar and cinnamon, but definitely not as sweet. it had a candied orange flavor and paste, that was not too much but just enough to give that orange flavor. it brought out more of the cinnamon flavor. and the bread itself was so flaky, buttery and soft. i wish i got two of this because this is something i've never had before. _pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant . smoked ham, gruyere. had this as well back home, popped it in the toasted over. the ham was slightly salty and the cheese was not as gooey but i'm sure it would have tasted way better when i ate it fresh that day. again the croissant was butter and the layers were just crisp throughout. i also love how the croissants are very thick and huge. this pretty much touched the top toasted oven. _tea cake loaf . lemon almond. i had this back at home two days later, and it was still good! the loaf was still very moist, but it seemed more on the buttery side. the edges had a nice lemon flavor and more on the sweeter side. this would have been good with some tea. _quiche slice . ham, seasonal vegetable. this was pretty good! and i only like quiche at proof bakery back home, but this was pretty darn close. i find the crust important on quiche, and the one here was buttery and fresh. the ham and veggies were good, although i find it a saltier than what i prefer, but it was filling and perfect for a savory and quick brunch. overall everything was great, but i find the prices pretty high. i would definitely come back here again, and i would say it is worth the wait, but be prepared to spend some for a few pastries."
173,Malek A.,1116,5,7/29/17,"the food is amazing. we tried the croque monsieur, pain au jambon , pain au chocola and bread pudding and they were all perfect. drinks were good as well. the best part about the food is that it was all freshly baked. besides the food, there is a long waiting line, the design of the place is outdated and the art is very random but who cares as long as the food is great! oh, i almost forgot, the staff was very nice!!"
174,Hayley B.,1116,4,3/11/17,"do not let the line scare you this place is worth the wait! i ordered the pain au jambon ham and gruyere croissant , had a bite of my friend's ham and leek quiche, and the frangipane tart almond and seasonal fruit . we also ordered lattes that were delicious and came in some adorable glassware. all of the food was delicious, and there were so many wonderful treats to try it was very hard to choose, which means a return trip will be necessary. because it can be so crowded, it might be difficult to eat on site. we did, but it was a little bit cramped and not all patrons are good about following the instructions to clear their plates when they are done eating. you might consider getting your treats to go and walking over to dolores park to enjoy them in some wide open spaces. enjoy!"
175,Tiffany C.,1116,5,2/19/17,"i think i've tried almost everything at this bakery.but really lol. not the greatest place to meet a large group as you have to find seating which is pretty challenging as most people are also trying to catch up with friends family over delicious pastries as well. all of tartine's baked goods have this crust on them and for people who love crunchy food like me, this is your dream come true. items i've tried croissant pretty good but not the best i've ever had almost croissant the filling is amazing and not too overpowering pain au chocolat make sure to get this when it is warm!! pain au jambon really tasty the perfect afternoon snack these are really messy so have lots of napkins on standby morning bun this is one of their more popular items and it is delicious and a little different because of the orange zest but not my favorite item here brioche bread pudding super underrated. i would recommend getting this for anyone who hates bread pudding because this will change your mind tea cake lemon poppyseed really moist and gf too croque monsieur cheese and ham i mean common who would not love this banana cream tart really messy and flaky. i would not recommend but they do have this massive one that could be fun to take to parties lemon cream tart this this this always order this. the most delicate lemon flavor and smoothest cream just ugh so good chocolate hazelnut tart this is a little dry and i was not too happy with this treat in all, tartine is amazing. i will be coming back and visiting the upcoming la location as well d"
176,Lorena S.,1116,4,12/20/16,came here for a snack while we walked to see the local murals. there was a pretty long line but it moved rather quickly. i ordered a regular croissant and a pain au jambon . it is funny because i realized it was a ham and cheese croissant but ordered it as they had it labeled. when they ringed me up they said regular and ham and cheese croissant. i was concerned because the croissant looked burnt but i took a bite and it was the perfect combo of hard and soft. the outside had this great hard and flaky crust while the inside was super soft. it made it more of a sandwhich then bakery item which is what i was going for. the place was really small and packed. i would suggest that any non locals get their items to go and enjoy the rest of the mission district which is packed with beautiful and powerful murals.
177,Kristina G.,1116,5,12/4/16,"when we first passed by tartine we almost gave up because the line out front was so long, but good thing we decided to try it out anyway! their pastries are so good that it is unexplainable!! we had to go the next day again! so, we tried pain au jambon which is a savory croissant with ham and cheese, savory scone, croque monsieur and then coconut cream tart and banana cream tart which tasted like they are out of this world!!! i totaly recommend coming here, you will never forget it! waiting in line for minutes does not bother you at all when you know you will try the best food ever!"
178,Sherry Y.,1116,5,11/13/16," late review aug weekend afternoon] came into the mission district to soak up some sun and delores park, and we decided to check out tartine to grab some baked goodies. boy oh boy was the line long. it took us about minutes to reach the counter, but all the memories of waiting went out the window when we saw all the items displayed. the first items we saw were the desserts and cakes what a way to start the day! without much background information on the bakery i know, smart move to wait in line and not know what to expect i was open to almost everything that i saw, and i had to tell myself times that i could not afford to buy everything nor did i have the stomach capacity to eat everything. sad life. i ended up grabing a small coconut creme tart, and croissants a regular, chocolate, and i believe it was the pain au jambon smoked ham + gruyere . there was no way i could finish all of these, even as someone who can eat a lot. the croissants are pretty huge, and even after eating the coconut creme tart i could barely eat the other croissants to compare my friends each could only eat or . pastries . the tart was out of this world, i would get this a second, third, xth time! i believe the banana creme tart was the hype of the tarts at tartine, but i'm not much of a banana creme tart fan. if it is as magical as the coconut creme tart go for it! as other reviewers have mentioned, the croissants are a good size.maybe half the size of my face my face is not the smallest. i almost gave the place a because of the line which really could not be helped , and the service the staff members were informative but hard to catch as they tried to get the line going i can understand having worked in the food industry, but being skipped over a few times was not a fun expeience . the staff were overall very efficient and quick on their feet, and having to work in such a hectic situation of hangry people does not make things easier, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed for a better next experience here at a notsobusy time good luck to that ."
179,Karen N.,1116,5,7/22/16,"my friend told me that we have to stop by here. so, of course, we did! we stopped by around on a monday and we only waited in line for about minutes. we ordered the croissant, hazelnut biscotti, bavarian, and the pain au jambon . bavarian was delicious very light and not overly sweet. since we were traveling, we saved the others for the morning when we were traveling home. and honestly, they were not stale nor bad. they were all so great. this place definitely lives up to the hype. we took our order to go. the place is a bit small so if you have a large stroller is difficult to navigate around inside. it was all worth it and i cannot wait to come back to try more!"
180,Trisha R.,1116,4,5/1/16,"i think sometimes we get caught up in the heat of the moment and the hype of something. we stood in line for the expected long wait time. i think from beginning to the end when we ordered was a total of minutes. i thought since we were there we would live it up and order a couple different things. we both ordered their famous morning bun. it was pretty so that is nice. first bite was lite and airy and not so sickly sweet as you would expect from a typical cinnamon roll bakery item. but the second bite lent itself to a hint of citrus that became less hinting and more prominent after each bite. i'm not saying it was not good i just personally do not care for that so much. but it was fairly inexpensive . each which seems reasonable even if you do not care for it. my husband loves bread pudding so we ordered a small bowl of their brioche bread pudding that came with some fresh strawberries on top and kind of mixed in . . that also was light which is nice. i would have to say i definitely prefer strawberries in my bread pudding instead of raisins that is for sure. but brioche bread is sweet to begin with so it was more on the sweet side. if i did not have the morning bun as well i could probably have eaten more. i'm obsessed with having to have some kind of egg dish for something to be considered breakfast so i ordered a slice of the vegetable quiche. i really liked the filling, once again it was light and fluffy. the french have a way at keeping things light. i did not care for the crust. it was burnt in my opinion and did not leave a nice flavor in my mouth. my husband said my quiche were better love him forever and i kinda have to agree. the last thing we ordered was the pain au jambon w jalapeno which they say they only make it that way on the weekend . . it was by far the best of everything we ordered. they should make it on the weekday as well. the ham was a nice thickness and the gruyere cheese flavor was there but not over powering. they use a fresh jalapeno and do not remove the seeds so beware. my last bite was a bit spicy. but super yummy. our total for items came to . . kinda pricey considering it was just baked goods and we could have had eggs benedict and omelettes for the same price. overall, we can say we have been to this tartine place but i'm not going to rush back anytime soon. it was good, prices were reasonable, but not waiting in line + minutes for good. you have to at least go once to say you have been."
181,Acilegna T.,1116,1,11/4/18,"what a tourist trap. after living in san francisco for my entire life, everyone told me to try tartine bakery. wow was i disappointed. this place is not worth the minutes i stood in line. no one writes down what you want, so if you are ordering more than pastries, get ready to have your order wrong when you get to the front. i think the girl that rang me up was fighting with the girl taking the orders up at the line because i got most of the attitude directed at her. not worth the hype or the money. ordered butter croissants pain au chocolat eclairs lemon tart i said thank you after the order and the girl ringing me up just stared off into space and ignored me. maybe she was having a bad day, but that was enough for me never want to come back."
182,John L.,1116,5,11/2/18,"candied orange and cinnamon sugar they are not as common a combination as peanut butter and jelly, thunder and lightning, or russell westbrook and poor fg percentage, but tartine bakery and cafe surely did their homework to roll them up into the finest morning bun ever. dipped in even more sugar, it was surprisingly not as sweet as it looked. it is flaky, buttery, and cinnamony, much like a cross between a croissant and a cinnamon roll in full swing! the morning bun alone is reason enough to come back, but the croque monsieur with shiitake mushroom will make the decision even easier. simply put, a croque monsieur is a ham and cheese sandwich but a lot better. their offering came with a choice of ham, turkey, shiitake mushroom, or fromage blanc. our order came nicely baked with plenty of mushrooms and melted gruyere cheese. my younger daughter enjoyed it so much that she wanted a single slice to be her next birthday cake. we just need to buy some candles! we also tried the huge gougere savory choux pastry with gruyere cheese and the largerthanusual pain au chocolat chocolate croissant . they were also delicious, but not as impressive as the other two items we had. the quiche, scone, croissant , cookie, tart, and cake looked appetizing as well, but we would have gone home broke had we decided to try them all. the wait was long and the prices were steep, but the quality and taste of the food were superior. seating oneself could be a challenge, but mission dolores park is just a couple of blocks away. enjoy the stroll while slowly nibbling away at that delightful morning bun."
183,Nari H.,1116,4,10/30/18,"came on a saturday in october around pm and waited at most minutes, unlike those who went in the morning and waited over mins. the line moved pretty fast given it is a small space and the line went out the door. here's what i got country bread loaf solid bread loaf, especially when it is just out of the oven. you will find a thicker heartier crust, and a dense inside. flavor is good, but on the mineraly side for me. it lasted for a few days after too. morning bun ish this is like a kouignamann got married to a cinnamon role and had a gigantic baby with a little bit of almondflavor pastelike filling. overall, very good, although not as memorable as the kouignamann from dominique's in nyc. pain au chocolate also ish. this was huge. probably the biggest chocolate croissant i've ever had, and really good. worth it for me, but wished there was a little more chocolate on the inside. i would get this again. goat cheese sandwich came with apple slices, and overall good, but would probably try something different. did not get the other things recommended since i was on the road and on the go, but i would definitely try to come back next time to try other things they offer here that others have raved about. until next time!"
184,Megan H.,1116,5,10/30/18,"so i would just had dinner and was on my way to dessert, but i had to stop by tartine bakery because it is a san francsico staple and i am not in the mission district often. i could not get any of the more extravagant desserts, but next time i am getting that coconut cream tart! cookies, croissants , pies, i could not decide. the guy behind the counter suggested the morning bun because it is their most popular item, so i went with that. morning bun . this is like a cinnamon roll in the way the bread has layers, but like a croissant in the way the bread pulls apart. it is flavored with cinnamon sugar and candied orange and is on the sweeter side. it took me a couple days to eat it. i really liked the crunch of the sugar granules covering the bun. i think the orange flavor complemented the cinnamon well. there was a line, but it moved fast, and the service was friendly. it is pricey, but worth it."
185,Harry X.,1116,3,10/28/18,"good, but overhyped in my opinion. tried a regular croissant and the coconut cream tart. the croissant was massive but pretty bland. i could barely taste any butteriness which sort of defeats the point of a croissant in comparison, arsicault bakery seems to do them much better. the coconut cream tart was delicious but came in at over after tax, which is more expensive than a super suiza quesadilla at el farolito basically this dessert costs more than a hearty meal in the same neighborhood . may come back later to try some of their other offerings, but not quite sure about the hype after my first visit."
186,Rebecca O.,1116,5,10/24/18,"holy mother. tartine takes the prize for the best pastries and baked goods i have ever had. we went twice while in sf both at off hours early morning and afternoon and only had to wait minutes. we tried a whole host of pastries, but my favorite was the morning bun. the croissant was the most incredible croissant ever. if you have the chance, go!"
187,Kevin N.,1116,5,10/24/18,"do yourself a favor a take a day off work and treat yo self with some delicious food from tartine. the line is totally worth it, but if you want to avoid the hassle, try to come on a weekday. the place itself is pretty small. if you have a large party, do not expect to be seated. they have a few tables inside and then three tables outside. pain au jambon ham and cheese croissant . must get. morning bun sweet and delicious. the orange really comes through the whole bun and not just the outside quiche i've never had a quiche this perfect before. the egg is the perfect soft consistency sourdough take a giant loaf home. so tasty and will last you a while"
188,Mary X.,1116,4,10/22/18,"pretty long waits throughout the day, but you have to try the banana cream tart. it was the best i've had mission pie comes very close . the crust is phenomenal and there is a caramelized flavor to it that makes it that much better. the croissants are huge and the lamination on them are pretty spot on. i personally thought the croissant was too crunchy though, was looking for a bit of fluff in the middle. morning bun was also very flaky and firm. i do not really eat morning buns though so i do not know how they should taste. the chocolate chip walnut cookie is big but very flat and super crispy. i enjoyed it, despite know all that extra butter is probably the secret to the nice crunch it has. would come back to try their lemon meringue cake and other cream tarts!"
189,Mel L.,1116,5,10/21/18,"tartine delivers the tastiest pastries and other baked goods so consistently. there is almost always a line but it tends to go quickly and it is always worth the wait. they are known for many things but the banana tart is one of the most well known. both the banana tart and the coconut cream are both very good, creamy with a flaky crust. the morning bun, almond croissant and the ham and cheese croissant are among my favorites and i have to get those every time. coffee is great too. the shop is small but i was fortunate enough to snag table seats the last two times i've visited. if you find yourself in the mission, stopping by tartine is a must."
190,Christopher L.,1116,5,10/21/18,"omg do not get me started on tartine. i've been here at least times so far and have been coming at least twice a month since i've moved here it is rare that i go anywhere more than once . it also does not help that i live a block away from this delightful, delicious bakery. the pastries they make here are probably the best i've ever had in the city. i would say my favorite are the almond croissant and the banana cream tart. i've also tried the regular croissant , chocolate croissant , ham and cheese croissant , morning bun, buttermilk scone, lemon meringue cake, ham and egg quiche and the croque monsieur with ham. so i will speak about the croissants in general. the croissants they create here are huge, you might think that is crazy for a croissant but i've paid for croissants that are half the size. here, they are super sized and can be a meal in itself! the croissants have a dry, crunchy surface that breaks super easily, but a warm, cozy, fluffy inside that almost melts in your mouth. their croissants here are so good and you would be fine choosing any croissant . the banana cream tart is even more filling, it really satisfies the craving for any sweet tooths out there. it comes with banana, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate flakes and a whole bunch of other goodness. one of the best tarts i've ever had. all the other things i've tried all of them are pretty solid. things that were pretty average were the morning bun and their scones, but still pretty decent. honestly, you cannot go wrong here! when in doubt, any of the things first listed in it is section is pretty solid. also prepare to wait here! unless you come really early. there is often a line that can take anywhere from minutes before when you line up and when you pay for your order. also do not come too late because they usually run out of the best things early on."
191,Carmen N.,1116,5,10/16/18,"the best croissant ever! nice and flaky, not to buttery. we also got the chocolate eclair. my son loved it so much we bought another one to take out. the match latte and coffee were on the weak side. would definitely come back for the pastry but would skip the drinks."
192,Jennifer C.,1116,5,10/16/18,we loved the morning bun! it was crispy and had a hint of citrus. the banana cream tart had real banana slices and was not too overwhelming in banana flavor. the crust had chocolate and caramel. the chocolate croissant was fluffy and so good!
193,Molly M.,1116,5,10/12/18,"tartine was one of our first stops on our trip to san francisco. after wandering the mission, we stopped by to grab some goodies before heading to enjoy them at dolores park. at , the line was out the door but still better than i expected! we waited for about minutes before getting to the front, where we ordered a croissant and a morning bun. both were enormous the croissant was deliciously buttery with a crisp flakey crust, and soft layers upon layers of delicate dough on the inside, with an appreciably nice chew. it was so good, i ruined my appetite for dinner! we ended up saving the morning bun and it was still good the next day sweet, with a hint of citrus zest. we saw loaves of sourdough coming out of the oven at this time, so if you want the freshest bread, get here around !"
194,Maria U.,1116,5,10/10/18,"i'm in love with this bakery, this place has my heart. everything about this place is great. the food, the customer service, and overall experience is amazing. this place does fill up quick so make sure you have a plan b if you cannot find seating inside. a lot of people do grab their treats and head out. when you first come in you see a large display counter on the left hand side, a register and drink bar towards the back and a seating area to the right. i would not recommend coming here with a large group of people unless it is during a less frequently visited time. when i went there with my coworker, we got a guyere & has croissant . a lemon tart and a frangipane tart with a couple of coffees. on my gosh, there is really no other way to say but this place is amazing!! the flaky croissant was out of this world. it had a delicious buttery taste to it with the right amount of crunch. the lemon tart was also absolutely genius. the lemon filling was perfectly made! the frangipane tart made me so happy, mary berry would be proud. the bottom was not crumbly or overly sweet. it was just right. im so sad in leaving san francisco next week because i want to come back here every single day. trust me you all, this is a bakery you want to visit if you are in town. you will not be disappointed!"
195,Jang N.,1116,5,10/10/18,the best bakery i have ever been to! it is the closest thing to bakeries i've had in france. i'm a huge fan of eclairs and they have the best eclairs i have ever tasted. i'm also a huge fan of croissants and they also had the best croissants . their morning bun is as good as advertised! their pies are also really good and their quiches are decent i'm usually do not like quiches . make sure you try the banana cream tart. super sweet but super delish! do not let the long lines fool ya it goes by pretty quickly
196,LAIKA K.,1116,5,10/2/18,"you literally cannot go wrong here. everything is delicious! the great, croissants , the cakes and the bread pudding!"
197,Laura K.,1116,5,9/28/18,"there is only one word needed to describe the first bite of their morning bun happiness. balancing the crisp exterior of a croissant with the doughy inside of a cinnamon bun, and just a hint of sunny citrus, it is a joy to eat. especially when you are lucky enough to get there as they are pulling a pan warm from the oven. it is a san francisco musteat. their country bread is equally top notch crackly crumb, sexy, large air pockets and just the right amount of hearty chewiness. take note that the loaves are huge, so if you manage not to eat the entire thing, they freeze well sliced."
198,Angela L.,1116,4,9/27/18,"this place has very, very good pastries, and def worth a visit, however, it did fall short of the hype for me. although the croissant and pain au chocolat were quite good although a bit burned on one side , they were not any better than several other pastry shops i have visited. that being said, they were very delicious, very buttery and flakey, and most importantly, not skimping on the chocolate. my big recommendation is the morning bun, which is outofthis world good. like really really good. most likely the best pastry i've ever had. and that is saying something considering that i took this one to go and ate it the next day. one day old and still the best, that is how good it was! this was the one thing i tried that did in fact live up to the hype! i would def come back here and encourage others to as well! but i would recommend skipping straight to the morning bun and def not get the savory scones really really dry. scones are naturally drier i know, but these made my mouth and throat feel like a desert, no joke! . do expect a long wait and a few extra minutes to find parking, but it is worth it if you order it right thing "
199,Anina M.,1116,5,9/26/18,came here before catching my flight. i heard a lot of good things about it so i had to go and try for myself. this place is definitely a sweets spot. had the almond croissant and it was almost as good as the ones i had in paris. also ordered a lemon tarte if you tart and lemon get it. if not i suggest getting something else. me and my friend also ordered a latte and a cappuccino.
200,Melissa D.,1116,4,9/25/18,great croissants and absolutely glorious bread!!! some of the pastries are subpar but i understand i may not have a sophisticated pallet. i do love hot cheetos and a wide array trashy food. i will always return here though for a loaf of country bread for home. jesus lord the bread is amazing! lovely staff. great spot even though at times there is a long line.
201,Fanny W.,1120,5,11/7/18,"found myself here again for another sponsored pharma dinner. in short, gary danko delivers perfection when it comes to service and execution. what i ordered + glazed oysters, + lemon pepper duck breast , + baked chocolate souffle, glazed oysters w caviar delicious duh! . wanted to try the risotto but i love me some oysters. love how it is slightly cooked but still maintains the texture of a raw oyster. duck breast phenomenal. tender and a perfect mediumrare. generous portions paired with a nice duck hash and puree. baked souffle fluffy. i've had several souffles in the past and was never really a fan. but wow! i loved my souffle, ate it all without the two sauces. not overly sweet, fluffy all around with a moist mushy center. i guess i do like souffles but only at gary danko."
202,Faye M.,1120,5,10/24/18,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast . although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
203,Katy W.,1120,5,10/19/18,"tl dr do not hesitate. book the reservation. it is the most bang for your buck michelin star experience you will get. the service is amazing and the food is even better. do it. and then read reviews to figure out what dishes you want. seriously, one of my favorite dining experiences ever. worth every penny you spend here and more!!! we came here for our joint th birthdays. after much thought, we decided that gd has been one of our top dining experiences and that there was no better place to spend our birthdays. we each ordered the course dinner. salt cured foie gras torchon with peach compote his the lesser of the two foie dishes, but still delicious. i wish there was more bread for the foie, but that is our only gripe with this dish. seared foie gras with caramelized onions & black mission figs mine oh my god. get this. the onions, foie, and figs pair perfectly for an explosion in your mouth. would get again. roasted sea scallops mine i got this dish last time, and got it again this time. it never disappoints and is always delicious. the cook on the scallop is perfect and it is tender and juicy. roast maine lobster his if i was not mildly allergic to lobster, this would have been my dish. the components of this dish really seal the deal. the lobster was cooked well and not gummy. seared filet his probably our least favorite dish of the evening, but even then, it is something we enjoyed. the cook medium rare was great and the basil butter excellent. pan seared bass mine i ordered this even though i'm not a fan of bell peppers or capers.but seriously, i am so impressed. i cleared my plate and finished it all. impressive especially if you know me and know that i will pick the tiniest piece of bell pepper out of any dish. lemon pepper duck breast mine i will admit that by this course, i was feeling fully stuffed and needed to save room for dessert. so i took a taste and asked them to box it up for me. even as my lunch the next day.it was delicious. best lunch ever. note gd's duck has been my favorite dish out of any duck dish i've had.even internationally. do not miss out. trio of creme brulee mine my favorite dessert is creme brulee. if it is on the menu, i will get it. three of them sold. the flavors this time were vanilla, bourbon, and ginger. the vanilla was wonderful cannot ever go wrong with the og. the bourbon was to die for. it tasted like caramel and flan it was just the right amount of gooey and melt in your mouth. it was super sweet though. the ginger one was the only one that was slightly disappointing. it had a little too much bite and was overpowering. i love the take home cake they send you with. they used to only give it to the women in the dining party, but this time they gave us two!!!! mmmm mmm mm pineapple cake for breakfast the next morning. not going to lie, the take home cake plays a huge role in my decision to come back to gd. service is impeccable but that is exactly what you should expect from somewhere as old school as gd. the last time we came, i was in a soft cast for my foot and they were super accommodating with my temporary handicap. this time, one of our entrees took a little longer than they expected. we did not mind since we understand that saturday nights are busy. but they comped a glass for wine for me and a glass of fancy merlot grape juice for my boyfriend. i cannot wait to come back here again it is still one of my our favorite dining experiences meals. goal try every menu item and every cheese on the cheese cart."
204,Sophie W.,1120,4,10/3/18,"back when i was a poor little college student, i remember always seeing gary danko pop up through a search of most reviewed restaurants in san francisco. now i'm still poor but have a much more hedonistic attitude towards the places i eat, which is what led me to make a reservation months in advance at gary danko for my friend's and my birthday dinner. gary danko is very classy old sf, from the suited up waiters to the candlelit booths. plus the windows are totally blacked out, so it feels like you are dining at midnight. the tables are pretty far apart so you have to really lean to have a conversation. our waiter had an incredibly calming voice and pulled out the table so we could squeeze into our seats tables are pretty close together . despite all this, the highlight of the service was the sourdough bread boy. he really kept  them coming with the refills of bread, and every time i finished my two slices, he would reappear like a genie and plunk two more pillowy slices of bread onto my plate with his tongs. we went for the choices from the menu and went crazy on the meat. we said screw it to the appetizers and ordered the stuffed quail, bison, lemon pepper duck , sea bass, lobster, and chocolate souffle. in order of favorites, mine were stuffed quail so much flavor crammed into this little bird lemon pepper duck super tender and came with a little potato cake of crispy potatoes and more duck bison this thing was huge. we were worried we would not be full, but along comes this plate of slabs of bison meat and some fat mushrooms. if you are worried you will not be full off courses, order the bison. lobster super buttery, but the showstopper was the mashed potatoes. they were so creamy and specked with corn sea bass undercooked. do not order. the chocolate souffle belongs in a whole other category. i'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but oh man with the vanilla and chocolate sauce soaked into a pillowy interior, this souffle was incredible. we also got a lemon mousse cake for our birthdays, and a plate of sweets that they always deliver at the end of the meal. the pineapple cake they give you as a going away gift is perfect with tea or coffee for breakfast the next day!"
205,Astrid V.,1120,4,9/24/18,"may have had too high of expectations for this place. sweet corn soup which was very flavorfulnice start to everything. seared ahi tuna dish would have been amazing if the tuna was up to par. the avocado and lemon dressing were very complimentary. they do not skimp on the avocado either sea scallops were small and not very exciting flavor wise. horseradish salmon was great! the cucumbers and mustard sauce were perfectly proportioned to enhance the salmon. i wish i would have ordered . lemon pepper duck was not anything to rave about and the filet was pretty standardbut appreciated the touch of swiss chard. peanut butter bar with dark chocolate was way more rich than i thought so have a pitcher of water ready. baked chocolate souffle was more savory than sweet but very very good. was sent home with the most adorable upside down pineapple cakes which were perfect with coffee the next morning. moist and flavorful but small enough you do not feel guilty. who am i kidding i never feel guilty about sweets. all in all, the service was outstanding!!!!"
206,Diane L.,1120,3,8/21/18,"i've had this restaurant on my bucketlist for the longest time. went this past sunday since my friend wanted to treat so i could not pass that up. our reservation was for pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. a little behind turned into being a minute wait. the manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. that was a nice gesture, but what would have been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. just my preference vs the free champagne small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons of soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing it was ok. i really wanted to fall in love with this place but it is overhyped for sure. my favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops, seared foie gras, dungeoness crab salad, and all the desserts flambeed cheeries with tres leches cake, lemon souflee cake, and the pineapple cake they give you to take home . the filet of beef was meh the sides on there tasted better and the lemon pepper duck was ok as well, what the heck gary danko maybe my expectations were too high. also, the seared ahi tuna had wayyy too much lemon soy dressing on there. i'm kinda glad i did not have to pay for this meal i did not think it was that worth it to me. such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner i was thinking that i would rather go to house of prime rib lol. overall, i did not come super hungry, but i thought the portions are a little small for my liking. nice presentation and service here, but i think this was just a one time thing for me. for example, it is like seeing someone hot. you just want to hit it and quit it. so basically aka being able to say you went to gary danko to eat just to say you did it."
207,Sherry L.,1120,5,7/24/18,"gary danko was definitely an experience and well worth your money! i love the fact that you can choose whatever you want on the menu based on how many courses you chose. my boyfriend chose a course and i chose a course and you can pick all entrees, all appetizers, all desserts if you choose, nobody will judge you . so what we did was order basically of whatever we wanted to try and shared it! we ordered foi gras risotto pan seared bass seared sea scallops herb crusted lamb lemon pepper duck pork tenderloin juniper crusted bison chocolate souffet if i were to rank my top favorite of the course it would be . seared sea scallops probably the best scallops i've ever had! i could not stop thinking about it even when we left foi gras very tasty a good idea would to put it on the bread that they provided for you we actually would have done that if we knew, we only know after we finished the foi gras but heard the table next to us do it! . lemon pepper duck the duck was tender and tasty, definitely recommended! if i were to rank my top that i did not like it would be . juniper crusted bison this was waaay too tough for me so i did not like it and tasted a bit bland. . pork tenderlion this was actually really tender but i thought it was too bland. . risotto i thought their risotto was just ok. after our meal, they gave us a mini plate of small assorted desserts and goodies to take home! this place left such a great impression that i would go again."
208,Andrew C.,1120,4,5/24/18,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "
209,Rod M.,1120,5,4/5/18,"what can i add to a place that has almost thousand reviews an essay that is what ! give my profile a follow if you like my reviews and or lists. . in the nickel n dime east bay i was born and raised on the san fran streets is now where i spend most of my days chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool rollin in my whip sometimes uber pool when a couple of yelpers who were up to no good started flaggin my reviews in ma neighborhood i got in one little fight and my wifey got scared i said  arelax honey i'm taking ya to gary danko to hobnob with da folks from bel air' . what to order at gary danko for a first timer i agonized over this and spent much more time than i should of thinking about this. i like lists rankings as those of you who follow me know .since they make decisions easier for me.so i turned this decision making process into the research project i dubbed gary danko number of times someone indicated this was their favorite dish game. i did a very very did i say very unscientific ranking based on going over a ton of yelp reviews of friends well written reviews. i did not do a spreadsheet but i tried to list them based on how frequent i felt they were mentioned. typically i do this rough calculcation analysis in my head but i wanted to get it down on paper because there were so many darn dishes to choose from. rank below is based on the # of instances i believed people mentioned the dish as their favorite dish. risotto seemed to be winner.on down. risotto pan seared scallops roasted quail lemon pepper duck breast roast maine lobster coconut thai curry foie gras cheese plate roasted pork tenderloin and belly loin of lamb sea bass so knowing that and knowing i had a hot date my wife . i went with the decision making process below. this would achieve my primary goal of getting to try as many dishes as possible. step create list ranking above step i then asked the wifey to let me know what she was ordering. key step .happy wife happy life. step she listed risotto, seared beef, dungeness crab salad step i requested that she bump up courses so we could taste more things. it helped that i was treating o p step so basically i eliminated risotto from my rankings. she also picked two dishes that were not on my list seared beef and dungeness crab salad darn! but hey see above.happy wife happy life. step we still had courses to play with so we went straight down the list . i added sea bass only b c i love seabass. so after that initial selection here is how i felt the dishes were reranked for your viewing pleasure from fave to least fave. i also put in parentheses what i perceived to be their rank before dinner. rod's gary danko dish rankings # favepan seared scallops so soft and tasty great sauce cannellini bean puree. best scallops i've had foie gras soft like butter carmelized onions and apples bring a great dynamic. pan seared sea bass the clam succotash , sweet potato puree and shallots the seabass sits on top of were also super tasty. coconut thai curry nice presentation. the waitress bring sauce in a mini pot and pours the sauce over the candied peanuts and shitake mushrooms. the curry sauce is a seafood medley of shrimp, calamari, lobster and scallops that taste delicious risotto everything goes well together and almost tastes like a fancier filipino dish arroz caldo. this where my must order for next time line is . roasted quail this is more about the things that are stuffed mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa and foie gras with fingerling potatoes and porcini cream than it is about the actual quail. i mean this was good but not amazing to me. dungeness crab salad nr another nice presentation and taste combo with melons, cucumbers, roasted eggplant and thai mango dressing. wifey insisted that she had a light salad so that is how this made it as a selection. once again see above.happy wife happy life. roast maine lobster good ,savory but clearly behind scallops n sea bass in my eyes in the seafood category lemon pepper duck breast bacon braised endive and cardamom poached pears were an interesting combo. i thought the dish was decent but not very flavorful as other dishes and would not order again. # least fave but still o.k. seared beef nr last gnocchi was tasty and the swiss char and stilton butter are nice touches but just was not a fan of this dish. would not order again . after dinner i requested a lyft and when it came near the license plate said 'fresh' and it had dice in the mirror after five courses you may have thought this night was done but i thought nah, forget it, yo holmes, to san tung!

210,Andrew Z.,1120,5,2/20/18,"celebrating valentines day just got a whole lot easier after discovering gary danko. dinner work like this you get to choose courses for , courses for , and for . you can mix and match any number of apps, main courses, and desserts that you want. course meal of main plates no problem. course meal of all the same app you can do that too. the menu comes with sections. apps, fish and seafood, meats and game birds, cheese , and dessert. we ordered apps . glazed oysters and caviar. . dungeness crab salad with avocado over a bed of quinoa. seafood. . branzini with fennel puree. . seared scallops and lentils. meats. . lemon pepper duck breast . . roasted stuffed quail with mushrooms and foie gras. . cheese board. . trio of creme brulee. we were more than stuffed at the end. . the glazed oyster dish comes with oysters over a bed of ossetra caviar. while the oysters were ok in this leek ceam sauce, the caviar tasted amazing. light, rich, and just melts in your mouth. i would order this dish again for the caviar in the leek sauce alone. . . dungeness crab salad. while i was not overly impressed by the oysters, this salad was the whole package. instead of fine chopping crab into small chunks that you might see in other salads, here you have large pieces of crab over pieces of grapefruit and avocado. what a combination that was. i think my new favorite way of eating crab now with grapefruit! the quinoa was ok as was the vinaigrette. they gave a bit too mich quinoa.but hey, when is too much a bad thing p . . branzini is our favorite white fish so this one was an easy selection for us. oh and the saffron orange emulsion mixed with fennel puree yea it was that good. she does not like olives and im not a huge fan either, but the ones in this dish were not as sour or sharp as other olives i had. . . scallops happen to be one of my favorite things to eat and gary danko does not disappoint. two large perfectly seared scallops with potatoes, roasted peppers and a light curry vinaigrette makes this an easy . everything just works in this dish. . the duck breast came with duck hash, poached pears, and a delicious garlic puree. while every individual compnent was excellent individually, i was not sure exactly how to tackle this dish. too many complex tastes here! still the generous portion size is tough to beat . . the roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and foie gras really hit the spot. the resturant keeps you filled with sourdough bread and what better way to eat the soft bread than with a spread of foie gras oh yea, the pumpkin orzo, truffle corn bread, and glazed apple were nice, too lol. what a dish. + . . here i have to apologize. im not a cheese person and good cheese is wasted on me. . . so the trio of creme brulee ended up being quite filling. vanilla, ginger, and burbon. highly recommend! overall, . cheers!"
211,Sydney C.,1120,4,2/19/18,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster, seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast , and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast . both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
212,Katherine C.,1120,5,1/24/18,"alright, this is going to be a long review, but mainly because i have to discuss every aspect. me and my bf did the course meal, because we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we do not get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. most people would probably do fine with the courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. before i forget valet parking is but you can definitely find street parking nearby although it may be a limit of hours in terms of menu items seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples !!!! omg this was the tastiest thing i have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. it was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things i picked risotto with rock shrimp . i'm not sure if i'm a fan of risotto, i may not be as i thought this was a little salty. my bf however thought it was really really good! seared scallops !! these scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. i felt like i was eating a meal from hells kitchen lol. there was also this thing in the middle that i could not tell what it was, some sort of potato cake it was super good too. i could not exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you are going here. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce the salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good because it was not dry like other salmons you would have at other restaurants. i like dill so i automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. i enjoyed the scallops more though. roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo !!! this was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! i thought the quail would be too much work but it was not and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!! lemon pepper duck breast with pears the duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf because it felt like it did not go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway lol. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. i think if the crabcake did not throw me off i would have given this a though. herb crusted loin of lamb with dates this was a lot better than i was thinking! i do not like lamb much but this dish did not taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here. seared filet of beef with gnocci both me and my bf did not really enjoy this too much, but i think its because we realized we do not like filet. it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that is about it. flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it is an extra but definitely worth it. grand marnier souffle this did not impress me and i guess it just felt like too much egg white or maybe i just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much lol so i would recommend the other desserts. espresso martini this was definitely a unique drink that i recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini. besides the food, even though i did not think every dish was , service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and that was enough for me to give on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around but that was mainly bc we got drinks and got the course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job! overall get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"
213,Amy C.,1120,4,1/21/18,"this was my second time to gary danko. it still remains my favorite michelin star restaurant, but i thought that this time was a little less of an incredible amazing outofthisworld experience than when i was here last november. there were no missteps that i can point to, but for some reason i did not feel like the service was quite as on point as previously although it was still very, very attentive , and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. our group of ordered courses each courses is and courses is you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts . we got the following appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples . the foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. my only disappointment is that it was about of the size of the foie gras that we had here in november. maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche . probably my least favorite dish of the night. it was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, i did not think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out. seafood roast maine lobster with potato puree, blood orange, edamame and basil the lobster was very tender and went well with the puree. beautifully presented. seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers , potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette . the scallops were so tender and full of flavor. one of my favorite dishes. meat seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter . a word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. the filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender. roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms, truffled corn bread and foie gras with pumpkin orzo and glazed apples . one of my favorite dishes. the skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, celeriacgarlic puree, belgian endive and cardamom poached pears . one of my other favorite dishes. i just love duck , and the duck hash was excellent as well! herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula . the meat had an interesting flavor. it had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much. dessert chilled peanut butter bar with dark chocolate ganache, feuilletine and pretzel ice cream . excellent! very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate. they also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted minidesserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"
214,Carolina H.,1120,5,11/29/17,"my husband brought me here for our anniversary dinner, please be aware that you need to make reservations months in advance. we had the risotto for the appetizer, the herb crusted loin and lamb, lemmon pepper duck , and seared filet of beef for our main course, and baked chocolate souffle for dessert. the food was absolutely amazing! and the service was great as expected for a high scale restaurant. they made our night extra special by giving us a complimentary anniversary chocolate cake. and we got a couple of pumpkin muffins to go for breakfast! this was an amazing place for an amazing night! the atmosphere is very romantic too, we were really happy with this restaurant and we are planning on coming back every time we visit san francisco. a romantic place for a romantic night!"
215,Cheryl N.,1120,5,11/28/17,"we were real lucky to book our thanksgiving weekend sunday night pm reservation just days in advance. there were three people in our dinner party and each had course meal. we skipped the cheese course with additional seafood and meat dishes in place so we were able to taste quite a selection of dishes. highlights seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples coconut thai curry risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, butternut squash, sage and beech mushrooms roasted maine lobster branzini with fennel puree, nicoise olives and saffronorange emulsion lemon pepper duck breast meh complimentary sour dough whole wheat bread not warm and being sour dough whole wheat grand marnier souffle with raspberry sorbet and two sauces under cooked and was drowning with too much blood orange sauce chocolate souffle with two sauces under cooked and lack of strong chocolate flavor complimentary pumpkin breakfast cupcake too much baking soda powder taste which makes it repulsive delightful fine dining experience and service staffs were phenomenal!"
216,Evelynn C.,1120,5,9/12/17,"man oh man, where do i even begin. o upon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table sidebyside. it was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. it was totally fine though because i love dining next to my boyfriend just as much as across from him p a wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the rules which is that there are not really any you can pick and choose from any section for your , , or course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. we opted to get a course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. after everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that i had ordered and allowed me to try some first before i got stuck with it. in general, i knew that i liked cabs and red blends so i knew the blend that i picked would not do me any injustice one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine. the wait staff rotated constantly so we were not able to bond with one, but that is ok too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected. appetizers risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, summer squash this was so yummy, i love seafood and so shrimp dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. my boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. funnily, even though he is extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day. seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries actually my first time that i tried foie gras this was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, meltinyourmouth deliciousness. definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. musttry if you have never tried foie gras!! fish and seafood roast maine lobster more seafood, my nd course pick. the lobster was so fresh, so tender. this set the new standard for all things seafood for me. the texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. until next time. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce hm, i generally really enjoy salmon, unfortunately or fortunately everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and i do not recall it being super outofthis world. perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here. meat and game birds juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms mmm bison. another first for me. actually i may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something heh.heh this was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. this was also a win for me. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries i do not usually go for duck . i'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this. was pretty much lifechanging. they sliced the mound of duck breast thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. i was honestly pretty surprised how much i liked this! good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork! desserts trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies who does not love creme brulee and it comes with different types. sold! lemon souffle cake with creme fraiche panna cotta and raspberry sorbet the tartness of the lemon helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than i would have preferred. ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds. dessertwise. my complimentary birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and i'm not even normally a chocolateloving person too sweet % of the time . however, their rendition of a chocolate cake mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that i became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. as if the complimentary birthday cake was not enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies petit fleurs , and gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! from service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was a+++."
217,Alex T.,1120,5,9/4/17,"finally, after hearing so much about gary danko i had the chance to come dine in this elegant restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday. we made reservations weeks in advance where the staff informed us what available dates and times they had and they even called us a day before our reservation as a friendly reminder. if you are worried about parking, do not be. there are plenty of options around the area with their own valet parking for , a parking garage up the block, or metered street parking good for up to hours until pm. we were lucky to have found metered parking down the block in a heavy traffic area. upon arrival we were greeted by the host and seated promptly. our waiter asked if we have dine at gary danko before and we replied that we have not and he kindly went through all of our options and answered every questions we had. you basically choose your preferred amount of courses and pick any item on the menu. if you chose a course you can grab desserts or entrees etc you are not limited to getting appetizer, entree and dessert you can choose whatever you like. our waiter also stated that they do not recommend all meat poultry dishes for your courses but, if we wanted to, they will not decline to give it to you. food review i went with the course meal and my partner with courses. we were also given a lot of free stuff along with every diner in the restaurant compliments from the chef. we were given a pea soup appetizer, for dessert we were given assortment of chocolate and sweets, and a parting cake gift. my selection consisted of glazed oyster with osetra caviar with zucchini pearls, leeks and lettuce cream, roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon, and herb crusted loin of lamb with summer vegetable tian and polenta. they were all done very well and i would recommend any of these dishes all the meats were cooked perfctly medium rare and just melted in my mouth like butter. they were pretty small in portions and wondered if i would be full and if i made the right choice with a course meal but, luckily the loin of lamb did the job! my partner ordered the ahi tuna, seared foie gras, with caramelized onions, and cherry, lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries, and the trio of creme brulee. all were done amazingly and much heartier than my choices. the only dish that was underwhelming for me was the ahi tuna, where the cumin was really present and the lime juice made the dish really acidic as well. the old fashion i ordered was perfectly mad and one of the best i've had and the moscow mule was plenty strong. end food review the staff were all exquisite and attentive and could be the best service i've had in a restaurant. there will be two main impressions people will have about gary danko the restaurant either you will love it or you will think it is just okay. i loved my experienced here but, i know many friends who thought it was okay. our waiter gave us a little tip after bringing us the bill, if they are full, you can always come by and sit at the bar without reservations. you will be able to order food a la carte and dessert which was great to know for the future. after picking up the bill our waiter also asked us if we need validation, if we used their valet or if he could call a cab for us which was great for them to offer!"
218,Sam L.,1120,5,9/3/17,"the ultimate complete american finedining experience, bar none! being lucky enough to have experienced jean georges in nyc's trump tower, oringer's clio in the elliot boston closed forever , lee's susur in kings west toronto closed forever one realizes how precious an establishment like gary danko really is. excellent food aside, the incredible ambience of the venue together with the to hours of vip prince princesses treatment by the entire crew down to the very minute details of the evening makes every gary danko visit a total pleasure. we definitely do not belong to the bookahead, and dresswellfordinner genre and despite the last minute booking and being subpar underdressed gary's crew made sure we felt superbly comfortable and valued throughout the evening right from the moment we entered the door, the impeccably dressed maitre d steven welcomed us, waiter andrew was tending to our every need during the evening, up until we left walking past the valet to hail our uber. being from a first generation immigrant family, dining value is important and still very much in our blood. it is amazing that danko's menu together with some of the other bestinbusiness operations like jean georges' and oringer's had been design to cater to even this slient niche foodie minority. making us feel great! being able to feast on finely plated and gourmet prepped assembled seared foie gras, roasted lobster, seared sea bass, and lemon pepper duck breast for around each sooths the frugal soul beats slumming in chinatown for the same stuff by distant miles. the wellpaced delivery, presentation of each dish, together with various 'complements of the chef' offerings throughout the evening, justifies the smaller tasting sized portions, ensuring our palate is never numbed enough from being full not to taste the fine ingredient and preparation of each dish. the  wouldesert after desert' and the 'take home cake' were some of the final touches that sealed this gary danko experience as among the finest dining experiences in our lives. thanks to the dedication of gary and his crew for keeping this class dining act inplay, for almost two decades. it is not an easy task anywhere, not to mention operating smack center in the tourist zone in one of the most expensive cities in the world to run a restaurant. danko is a gift to san francisco. treasure it while it lasts."
219,Ada H.,1120,3,8/13/17,"i really do not want to give this place three stars. i feel like on any other given night, i would have given stars. my boyfriend and i were seated promptly as soon as we got into gary danko. while my water was being filled, i got a slight splash of water on my dress. i brushed it off thinking eh one small thing like this does not mean this place has bad service. we ordered our drinks before we ordered our food. my boyfriend got a blanton and i was not sure if i wanted a sweeter wine but i did say one of the sweeter wines sounded good. the wait staff told me i could try it and if i liked it i could get it by the glass. the blanton was served first since they had to get the wine from the cellar. it was served in a chipped glass. i cannot fathom how someone can serve anything in a chipped glass in this type of establishment. we told the wait staff and they told us they would get us a new glass. we waited through our appetizers and entrees before my boyfriend finally flagged someone down to check up on his drink. when my wine arrived, he had my try a sip. i was not impressed by it so i asked for a pinot noir suggestion on the more fruit forward side. this guy had the audacity to make a snide comment of well you should have just stuck with pinot . well what if i wanted to try something different what a repulsive attitude this guy had all night. must have been a bad day but i still tried to be polite with this guy. anyways, the food is the most important part. this is the sole reason i am here. the seafood risotto was extremely creamy and light. delicate pieces of seafood just complimented the risotto. this is a must get here! the glazed oysters with osetra caviar is also a must get. the oysters were plump and was sweet while the caviar was light and salty which gave a good pop to the overall texture and taste. for this dish, it is an acquired taste. my boyfriend does not like the taste of the sea. thai coconut with seafood. those plump chunks of scallops were tender and not sandy which is the downfall of most places. thai coconut curry is light so it does not over power the flavors of the seafood. lemon pepper duck breast was not my forte. i usually like duck but i felt as if the duck was very bland. biggest disappointment of the night. strawberry souffle was light and fluffy. delicious as expected. like i said, maybe on another night i would have given this place stars, but the service was repulsive and unprofessional."
220,Angela H.,1120,5,6/28/17,"gary danko is an amazing restaurant! i celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here while we were visiting san francisco, and we were fortunate enough to be seated in a private booth for just us two! each table has red roses on it too, which made it quite romantic! service was beyond impeccable. there were multiple individuals servicing our table, which made the dinner go very smoothly. they cleared our tables quickly, checked in on us multiple times, served us without any lag time, and refilled our waters without having to ask. i got the course menu , and my boyfriend got the course menu . they served us each our plates, but we just shared our meals family style. thai soup amuse bouche with lobster it was very hearty, light, and flavorful. i wish they would have listed this as part of their menu because it was amazing, even better than some of their menu items. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, spring vegetables, and beech mushrooms most risottos are unbearably heavy and rich, but this was not. it actually reminded me of a thicker congee, so it was comforting to eat. they were also very generous with the shrimp and crab, which i really appreciated. glazed oysters with osetra caviar, white asparagus, leeks, and lettuce cream this was the perfect appetizer! the oysters were like little clouds in my mouth because it was just so fluffy and light. but if you are generally not a fan of oysters, i would not recommend it though because it does have a slight seafoody taste. roast maine lobster with potato puree, morel mushrooms, edamame, and tarragon the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the potato puree was a very flavorful mashed potato. i loved the broth that came with the plate! portion wise, this is a quite small plate, so just be aware if you are choosing this as an entree. coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, candied peanuts, and shiitake mushrooms omg. this is a must order plate. it was the best dish of the night! you are initially served a plate of white rice, and one of the servers then places the seafood around the rice and then pours the coconut thai curry over the rice and seafood. the flavor is so amazing that i honestly wanted another plate or even two! it is just so light and comforting. all the seafood was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. pan seared scallops with english peamint puree, asparagus, fava beans, and beech mushrooms scallops were so perfectly cooked! the description also says fava beans, but i think i had lentils with mine. overall, really solid dish. soft she will crab with pancetta, roasted eggplant, cucumber and thai lime dressing this was more like two separate dishes placed onto one plate. the soft she will crab was extremely flavorful, and the herb salad on the side was very refreshing. it reminded me of the inside of a vietnamese spring roll. portion wise, this is also a small plate, so just be aware. roasted quail stuffed with mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa, and foie gras with baby artichokes and green garlic it does not say in the description, but it is served with a mini corn bread cake, which i loved! the quail was super adorable and petite. i thought it was pretty great but nothing too special. the quail drumsticks were probably the highlight of this dish. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive, and port glazed cherries that duck breast was the definition of perfection. it was so well cooked and delicious. if you are not used to gamey meats, then beware that it is a tad more chewy than beef. as for the duck hash and all the sides, i could care less for them. those were just okay. trio creme brulee with assorted cookies there are creme brulee vanilla bean, brandy, and blueberry lemongrass. the vanilla is the classic one, and i just thought it was so yummy. the brandy one is a bit too rich and heavy, so i did not really enjoy it. the blueberry lemongrass one was a beautiful dark purple color, and it was tart in flavor. the assorted cookies were just okay. extra complimentary assorted dessert plate we received bitesized desserts that were all different in flavor. there was only one that i did not enjoy, which was the red jelly one. otherwise, i would recommend trying all of them because they were delicious. extra complimentary birthday chocolate mousse cake this was very sweet of them to bring out for my boyfriend's birthday. if you truly love the flavor of chocolate, then this is the dessert for you. it is not like the grocery market chocolate. it has a more rich, bitter chocolate flavor to it that is amazing on the palate. extra complimentary pineapple cheesecake muffin breakfast bread i love that they gave us something to bring home, especially since it was so convenient to eat the next morning before a flight. loved it! plus the wrapping was super cute!"
221,Faye M.,1120,5,10/24/18,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster , juniper crusted bison, filet of beef, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
222,Katy W.,1120,5,10/19/18,"tl dr do not hesitate. book the reservation. it is the most bang for your buck michelin star experience you will get. the service is amazing and the food is even better. do it. and then read reviews to figure out what dishes you want. seriously, one of my favorite dining experiences ever. worth every penny you spend here and more!!! we came here for our joint th birthdays. after much thought, we decided that gd has been one of our top dining experiences and that there was no better place to spend our birthdays. we each ordered the course dinner. salt cured foie gras torchon with peach compote his the lesser of the two foie dishes, but still delicious. i wish there was more bread for the foie, but that is our only gripe with this dish. seared foie gras with caramelized onions & black mission figs mine oh my god. get this. the onions, foie, and figs pair perfectly for an explosion in your mouth. would get again. roasted sea scallops mine i got this dish last time, and got it again this time. it never disappoints and is always delicious. the cook on the scallop is perfect and it is tender and juicy. roast maine lobster his if i was not mildly allergic to lobster , this would have been my dish. the components of this dish really seal the deal. the lobster was cooked well and not gummy. seared filet his probably our least favorite dish of the evening, but even then, it is something we enjoyed. the cook medium rare was great and the basil butter excellent. pan seared bass mine i ordered this even though i'm not a fan of bell peppers or capers.but seriously, i am so impressed. i cleared my plate and finished it all. impressive especially if you know me and know that i will pick the tiniest piece of bell pepper out of any dish. lemon pepper duck breast mine i will admit that by this course, i was feeling fully stuffed and needed to save room for dessert. so i took a taste and asked them to box it up for me. even as my lunch the next day.it was delicious. best lunch ever. note gd's duck has been my favorite dish out of any duck dish i've had.even internationally. do not miss out. trio of creme brulee mine my favorite dessert is creme brulee. if it is on the menu, i will get it. three of them sold. the flavors this time were vanilla, bourbon, and ginger. the vanilla was wonderful cannot ever go wrong with the og. the bourbon was to die for. it tasted like caramel and flan it was just the right amount of gooey and melt in your mouth. it was super sweet though. the ginger one was the only one that was slightly disappointing. it had a little too much bite and was overpowering. i love the take home cake they send you with. they used to only give it to the women in the dining party, but this time they gave us two!!!! mmmm mmm mm pineapple cake for breakfast the next morning. not going to lie, the take home cake plays a huge role in my decision to come back to gd. service is impeccable but that is exactly what you should expect from somewhere as old school as gd. the last time we came, i was in a soft cast for my foot and they were super accommodating with my temporary handicap. this time, one of our entrees took a little longer than they expected. we did not mind since we understand that saturday nights are busy. but they comped a glass for wine for me and a glass of fancy merlot grape juice for my boyfriend. i cannot wait to come back here again it is still one of my our favorite dining experiences meals. goal try every menu item and every cheese on the cheese cart."
223,Bailey Z.,1120,4,5/30/18,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains , the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef, which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake. as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."
224,Andrew C.,1120,4,5/24/18,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "
225,Annie L.,1120,4,5/12/18,"gary at gary danko! took my boyfriend gary out for his th birthday dinner here as we have been saving this spot for a special occasion. food courses pan seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, garlic confit, tomato and basil roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream we also had the following complimentary dishes special soup from the chef, assorted dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. take home complimentary pineapple cream cheesecake. service great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care of the whole night. however, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members of the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. many times, i had a member of the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. i felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort of taken away. would i come back again i'm willing to give them another try. was i full off of the main courses noi had small scallops and small lobster tails. boyfriend had the beef and we shared the cake. i was filled up off of the butter cake, dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. alot of sweets as fillers but was not full off of the actual courses. would recommend for special occasions, for the ambiance and delicious food."
226,Rod M.,1120,5,4/5/18,"what can i add to a place that has almost thousand reviews an essay that is what ! give my profile a follow if you like my reviews and or lists. . in the nickel n dime east bay i was born and raised on the san fran streets is now where i spend most of my days chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool rollin in my whip sometimes uber pool when a couple of yelpers who were up to no good started flaggin my reviews in ma neighborhood i got in one little fight and my wifey got scared i said  arelax honey i'm taking ya to gary danko to hobnob with da folks from bel air' . what to order at gary danko for a first timer i agonized over this and spent much more time than i should of thinking about this. i like lists rankings as those of you who follow me know .since they make decisions easier for me.so i turned this decision making process into the research project i dubbed gary danko number of times someone indicated this was their favorite dish game. i did a very very did i say very unscientific ranking based on going over a ton of yelp reviews of friends well written reviews. i did not do a spreadsheet but i tried to list them based on how frequent i felt they were mentioned. typically i do this rough calculcation analysis in my head but i wanted to get it down on paper because there were so many darn dishes to choose from. rank below is based on the # of instances i believed people mentioned the dish as their favorite dish. risotto seemed to be winner.on down. risotto pan seared scallops roasted quail lemon pepper duck breast roast maine lobster coconut thai curry foie gras cheese plate roasted pork tenderloin and belly loin of lamb sea bass so knowing that and knowing i had a hot date my wife . i went with the decision making process below. this would achieve my primary goal of getting to try as many dishes as possible. step create list ranking above step i then asked the wifey to let me know what she was ordering. key step .happy wife happy life. step she listed risotto, seared beef, dungeness crab salad step i requested that she bump up courses so we could taste more things. it helped that i was treating o p step so basically i eliminated risotto from my rankings. she also picked two dishes that were not on my list seared beef and dungeness crab salad darn! but hey see above.happy wife happy life. step we still had courses to play with so we went straight down the list . i added sea bass only b c i love seabass. so after that initial selection here is how i felt the dishes were reranked for your viewing pleasure from fave to least fave. i also put in parentheses what i perceived to be their rank before dinner. rod's gary danko dish rankings # favepan seared scallops so soft and tasty great sauce cannellini bean puree. best scallops i've had foie gras soft like butter carmelized onions and apples bring a great dynamic. pan seared sea bass the clam succotash , sweet potato puree and shallots the seabass sits on top of were also super tasty. coconut thai curry nice presentation. the waitress bring sauce in a mini pot and pours the sauce over the candied peanuts and shitake mushrooms. the curry sauce is a seafood medley of shrimp, calamari, lobster and scallops that taste delicious risotto everything goes well together and almost tastes like a fancier filipino dish arroz caldo. this where my must order for next time line is . roasted quail this is more about the things that are stuffed mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa and foie gras with fingerling potatoes and porcini cream than it is about the actual quail. i mean this was good but not amazing to me. dungeness crab salad nr another nice presentation and taste combo with melons, cucumbers, roasted eggplant and thai mango dressing. wifey insisted that she had a light salad so that is how this made it as a selection. once again see above.happy wife happy life. roast maine lobster good ,savory but clearly behind scallops n sea bass in my eyes in the seafood category lemon pepper duck breast bacon braised endive and cardamom poached pears were an interesting combo. i thought the dish was decent but not very flavorful as other dishes and would not order again. # least fave but still o.k. seared beef nr last gnocchi was tasty and the swiss char and stilton butter are nice touches but just was not a fan of this dish. would not order again . after dinner i requested a lyft and when it came near the license plate said 'fresh' and it had dice in the mirror after five courses you may have thought this night was done but i thought nah, forget it, yo holmes, to san tung! "
227,Trish P.,1120,4,3/6/18,"i wanted to jump on the bandwagon of giving gary danko a star, but i would betray myself if i do so. maybe i was expecting too much out of gary danko i wanted to love my experience at gd, but let me put it this way if you have never been to gd and you think that perhaps you are missing outwell hun, you are not. but a once in a while visit would be luxurious enough. ok let us talk food for starters, they provided us with yellow beets for amuse bouche, and i would say, i will order this by itself as an appetizer if only it was on the menu! it was so good! i had the course menu consisting of the following cured foie gras torchon with roasted grapes, candied peanuts, & honey tuille this is below the best foie gras i've ever tasted! the perfect foie gras torchon is supposed to kinda melt on your tongue like a creamy butter. ths one was served cold as it should be. yes, foie gras torchon is the kind of thing that is got to be served as cold as possible, but then when you do serve it, you got to provide a warm knife. that way the foie gras kinda melts in the mouth. you know what i mean well, they did the former but not the latter. again, like i said, perhaps i was expecting too much. seared ahi tuna with avocado, nori, enoki mushrooms and lemon soy dressing came with slices aesthetically placed to look like a tuna butterfly cute! , the two bigger portions had a rich bright red color, which was the most desirable. the two smaller ones patched with the nori had a brownish color when i flipped it. the taste was not the freshest. i traded this one with my friend's plate and i ate his panseared bass plate instead. pan seared bass with israeli couscous, broccoli, glazed turnips, and radish oh, my goodness, thank you for this saving grace! the pan seared bass was cooked to perfection, and the couscous is probably the best version i've ever tasted of it. mixed together, they were exploding with tastiness and flavor, i was wowed. roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon small lobster portion enough to fill my tiny body. the lobster was tender cooked saturated with tasty potato puree. it was good. grand marnier souffle with creamsicle ice cream and two sauces raspberry and something else a really pale version of souffle that spent time in the oven just the right amount of time. it was not too airy, nice texture, deftly sweetened. i ate it all by myself! heh. now let us talk service they offer coat checkins and valet service. they did not ask for my id when i ordered winei'm impressed. other restaurants are fooled by my asian genes. gd staff did not bother. they serve complimentary bread, which was quite boring frankly, it was a waste of time _ they give you a little cake if you made your reservation and told them it was for a celebration. it was my best friend's birthday, so i got to blow the cake candle for him. haha. their bathroom looks elegant, like, why is there a chair beside the toilet seat there are reasons to this of course. our server s were not really personable, they were like in allbusiness mode and that was not very friendly or welcoming. they give you little takeaway desserts pastries wrapped in a golden package so that you will remember them even when you get home. kind of like, to reinforce the unforgettable dining experience you had last night."
228,Sydney C.,1120,4,2/19/18,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster , seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster , coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
229,Amy C.,1120,4,1/21/18,"this was my second time to gary danko. it still remains my favorite michelin star restaurant, but i thought that this time was a little less of an incredible amazing outofthisworld experience than when i was here last november. there were no missteps that i can point to, but for some reason i did not feel like the service was quite as on point as previously although it was still very, very attentive , and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. our group of ordered courses each courses is and courses is you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts . we got the following appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples . the foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. my only disappointment is that it was about of the size of the foie gras that we had here in november. maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche . probably my least favorite dish of the night. it was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, i did not think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out. seafood roast maine lobster with potato puree, blood orange, edamame and basil the lobster was very tender and went well with the puree. beautifully presented. seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers, potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette . the scallops were so tender and full of flavor. one of my favorite dishes. meat seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter . a word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. the filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender. roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms, truffled corn bread and foie gras with pumpkin orzo and glazed apples . one of my favorite dishes. the skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, celeriacgarlic puree, belgian endive and cardamom poached pears . one of my other favorite dishes. i just love duck, and the duck hash was excellent as well! herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula . the meat had an interesting flavor. it had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much. dessert chilled peanut butter bar with dark chocolate ganache, feuilletine and pretzel ice cream . excellent! very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate. they also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted minidesserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"
230,Tina C.,1120,5,11/22/17,"my all time favorite restaurant in sf!! i booked my reservation two months in advance just to get the desirable date n time that i wanted. the host called three days early just to confirm it with me. i also requested to sit in the main dining room because i thought the second room was a lil too crowded and the decoration is not as nice as the main dining room. we reserved it for two people at pm. lots of street meter parking but it is free after . we were greeted and seated right away from the host. my boyfriend and i decided to get the five course meal. there is also complimentary bread n butter in the beginning. i ordered seared ahi tuna, roast maine lobster , lamb, duck breast, and lastly cheesecake for dessert. everything was spectacular and delicious. i really do not have any complaints at all. they were that amazing from the food to the service. bill was for two people excluding tips. if you want to celebrate and go to somewhere special gary danko is the place to be!"
231,Jenny C.,1120,5,10/21/17,"i absolutely loved my time at gary danko. the menu was super flexible and let you choose courses depending on how many dishes you wanted to try. you could even choose entrees if you wanted though of course not recommended . the service was impeccable and the waiters are all very knowledgeable about all the dishes. they aimed to make sure you left very wellfed and satisfied. when i was unsure of whether or not to get a certain drink, they even let me sample it before deciding i did not even ask to sample it, but very much appreciated that they allowed me to do so. they even threw in a free amuse bouche in the beginning, a parcel of pineapple cake to take home, and a tray of assorted desserts at the end. i came with a friend and we each chose to do a course meal totaling different dishes to try . i loved each and every one of them, but of those, i highly recommend the following seared foie gras my friend thought this was even better than the foie gras we had in paris , glazed oysters, roast maine lobster , and if you love cheese the cheeseboard harbison and chimay . definitely plan to come back at some point in the future."
232,Susan L.,1120,5,9/15/17,my favorite fine dining experience of all times. the food is all so well prepared with perfect service. . rissoto dung crab . seared filet of beef . roast maine lobster . glazed oyster . quail versus squab . duck . bison . foie gra . melon with creme fresh soup complimentary . dessert petit fours plate complimentary . bread to go! complimentary paired with prosecco. we ordered a bit too much and was overly stuffed. will go back for sure but maybe go for less dish. we picked dishes each. my fav part of this you can pick and choose any dish. word of advice if you are not a huge dessert person see above . they will provide a plate so go for the entree dishes! just writing this review a year later and i'm realizing that we have to come back now!
233,Jimmy I.,1120,2,9/13/17,"tldr place is only good for the ambiance and plating maybe seafood . nothing special. there is no bang for the buck in the food. do not eat the birthday cake. i think minny the help made it with her special ingredient. i did some research for our vacation and people recommended to reserve restaurants only a week in advance. bad idea. all the top choices were completely booked and this was the only place still taking reservations. no surprise i had requested we get a table where we can sit next to each other during the confirmation call. instead they still seated us at a table where we were sitting across from each other, and i had to talk to different people before they changed our table of which never came back and of those people actually ignored me when i tried to get their attention i made eye contact and i signaled] . bread the first round of bread was so stale it actually clanked when dropped not placed on my plate. second round of bread was ok, but my appetite was already completely destroyed by the horrible bread before. appetizers poached farm egg honestly this was pretty good. it is one of the few reasons it is getting a stars. i recommend the poached egg if you decide to come here against my recommendation. perfectly cooked. simple yet rich taste. seared foie gras with caramelized onions i usually like foie gras, but this was horrible. the best part of this dish was the caramelized onions. foie gras was not seared, but burned where one side was actually crispy. i was told it should be like that. no. no. no! i know what a forced fed duck liver's texture and taste is suppose to be like. seafood roast maine lobster the lobster was better than what i was expecting after having tasted all the other courses before it. the lobster was fresh and well seasoned. the flavors worked together harmoniously. i would recommend it. taking into consideration the lobsters were from maine , it was quite good. seared scallops the peamint puree complimented the scallops exceptionally well. well made. do i think it could have been better yes. was it satisfactory yes. it was good but not great. i would say that a nd or rd year culinary student with a bright future made this. any place with on yelp, i expect nothing short of greatness not something that is a work in progress. meat lamb bison they were both pretty bad. the quality of meat was just terrible. you can tell the chef did the best he could with the ingredients he has, but boy was the meat bad. they gave a plentiful amount of sauce to cover up the bad meat, but you cannot hide a bad foundation. cheese raisin bread with cheese really the cheese on the cart was bad. we got a recommendation of the most popular cheese and they were all terrible. there was obvious signs that the cheese has been aerated for quiet some time before they were served. the discoloration was bad. with low lighting and wine, it feels like they think you will not notice the difference. are those grapes from safeway taste like it. desserts do not eat the birthday cake. tastes horrible. does not even taste like chocolate. it reminds me of the day when i get a case of the runs and the smell of your own fecal matter makes you want to vomit. that smell is what the taste is like. i actually vomited a little into the napkin. i took it to go and threw it out once i got out of the door. i would not even give it to a homeless person. strawberry souffle the best part was the strawberry sorbet. rich strawberry sorbet. everything else was trash. i normally like anything strawberry but this was so bad i felt sorry for the strawberries. it looks good when they pour the sauces in. it tastes completely and utterly disappointing. it tasted like trash and went directly in the trash. flambe it was decent. the guy making it did not seem to know what he was doing and was actually shaking quite a bit. the pieces of pineapple were extremely sour. at least use ripe fruits. the sauce was good, but it was only made up of ingredients sugar, butter, and alcohol. also other servers were constantly brushing past him, it was somewhat annoying. let the man make my dessert undisturbed! p.s. also most servers are wearing oversized suits. if i wanted to see people with baggy shirts and pants, i would just go back to high school. at least look presentable."
234,Evelynn C.,1120,5,9/12/17,"man oh man, where do i even begin. o upon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table sidebyside. it was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. it was totally fine though because i love dining next to my boyfriend just as much as across from him p a wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the rules which is that there are not really any you can pick and choose from any section for your , , or course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. we opted to get a course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. after everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that i had ordered and allowed me to try some first before i got stuck with it. in general, i knew that i liked cabs and red blends so i knew the blend that i picked would not do me any injustice one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine. the wait staff rotated constantly so we were not able to bond with one, but that is ok too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected. appetizers risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, summer squash this was so yummy, i love seafood and so shrimp dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. my boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. funnily, even though he is extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day. seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries actually my first time that i tried foie gras this was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, meltinyourmouth deliciousness. definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. musttry if you have never tried foie gras!! fish and seafood roast maine lobster more seafood, my nd course pick. the lobster was so fresh, so tender. this set the new standard for all things seafood for me. the texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. until next time. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce hm, i generally really enjoy salmon, unfortunately or fortunately everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and i do not recall it being super outofthis world. perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here. meat and game birds juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms mmm bison. another first for me. actually i may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something heh.heh this was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. this was also a win for me. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries i do not usually go for duck. i'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this. was pretty much lifechanging. they sliced the mound of duck breast thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. i was honestly pretty surprised how much i liked this! good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork! desserts trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies who does not love creme brulee and it comes with different types. sold! lemon souffle cake with creme fraiche panna cotta and raspberry sorbet the tartness of the lemon helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than i would have preferred. ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds. dessertwise. my complimentary birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and i'm not even normally a chocolateloving person too sweet % of the time . however, their rendition of a chocolate cake mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that i became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. as if the complimentary birthday cake was not enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies petit fleurs , and gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! from service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was a+++."
235,Alex T.,1120,5,9/4/17,"finally, after hearing so much about gary danko i had the chance to come dine in this elegant restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday. we made reservations weeks in advance where the staff informed us what available dates and times they had and they even called us a day before our reservation as a friendly reminder. if you are worried about parking, do not be. there are plenty of options around the area with their own valet parking for , a parking garage up the block, or metered street parking good for up to hours until pm. we were lucky to have found metered parking down the block in a heavy traffic area. upon arrival we were greeted by the host and seated promptly. our waiter asked if we have dine at gary danko before and we replied that we have not and he kindly went through all of our options and answered every questions we had. you basically choose your preferred amount of courses and pick any item on the menu. if you chose a course you can grab desserts or entrees etc you are not limited to getting appetizer, entree and dessert you can choose whatever you like. our waiter also stated that they do not recommend all meat poultry dishes for your courses but, if we wanted to, they will not decline to give it to you. food review i went with the course meal and my partner with courses. we were also given a lot of free stuff along with every diner in the restaurant compliments from the chef. we were given a pea soup appetizer, for dessert we were given assortment of chocolate and sweets, and a parting cake gift. my selection consisted of glazed oyster with osetra caviar with zucchini pearls, leeks and lettuce cream, roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon, and herb crusted loin of lamb with summer vegetable tian and polenta. they were all done very well and i would recommend any of these dishes all the meats were cooked perfctly medium rare and just melted in my mouth like butter. they were pretty small in portions and wondered if i would be full and if i made the right choice with a course meal but, luckily the loin of lamb did the job! my partner ordered the ahi tuna, seared foie gras, with caramelized onions, and cherry, lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries, and the trio of creme brulee. all were done amazingly and much heartier than my choices. the only dish that was underwhelming for me was the ahi tuna, where the cumin was really present and the lime juice made the dish really acidic as well. the old fashion i ordered was perfectly mad and one of the best i've had and the moscow mule was plenty strong. end food review the staff were all exquisite and attentive and could be the best service i've had in a restaurant. there will be two main impressions people will have about gary danko the restaurant either you will love it or you will think it is just okay. i loved my experienced here but, i know many friends who thought it was okay. our waiter gave us a little tip after bringing us the bill, if they are full, you can always come by and sit at the bar without reservations. you will be able to order food a la carte and dessert which was great to know for the future. after picking up the bill our waiter also asked us if we need validation, if we used their valet or if he could call a cab for us which was great for them to offer!"
236,Hailey P.,1120,4,8/14/17,"i have to admit, i've been avoiding this review for a few weeks now because there is so much to write about!! i came here for a fun team dinner because we are all foodies and have had gary danko on our bucket lists for a long time now. we showed up right on time for our reservation and were seated immediately. a total plus at such a popular spot! we ordered drinks from the very friendly som and i got an extra dirty martini because duh, this is the place to get one. they did take a long time to come out! but other than that, it was dirty {blue cheese olives and all} and delightful. they have a super cool menu setup where you choose the amount of courses that you would like to taste and can pick anything that you want from their very extensive menu. heck, if you wanted to choose courses of dessert, you could! there are definitely items on there for everyone! or you can choose to go with their chef's tasting menu and not have to worry about a thing because let me tell you, narrowing down your options to only , , or dishes is no easy task at gd! you will be fighting 'your eyes are bigger than your stomach' the entire time because you are sure to want to try one of everything. while i debated courses for a long time, i'm really happy that i stuck with , it ended up being the right amount of food and a good variety of items. the portions are pretty small though, so without the endless amounts of bread they were serving while waiting for the food to come out, i may have still been a tad hungry with only the . now here were the courses that i chose! first course dungeness crab salad with avocado, citrus, bulgar and mustardtarragon vinaigrette delicious!!! the tarragon flavor really made it unique and tasty. second course poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche i was super bummed about this dish. when i think carbonara, i think pasta dish, but this is literally just a poached egg over a very tiny cracker. not a fan! third course roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon i really enjoyed this course. it was very small in size, i.e. not much lobster but flavorful and you do get the claws. sweet meat and yummy! fourth course seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter my favorite! i'm a meat and potatoes girl and this was amazing. thank goodness for this course because i may have still been hungry if it was as tiny as the others. i opted out of my own dessert but tried some of the others at the table. the strawberry souffle was pretty dang incredible! they also bring complimentary mini sweets to your table at the end of the meal so if you only need a little sweet bite to cap off your meal, i would use your course choices on the main dishes! all in all, the portions were small, service was on the slower side, and to be completely honest, it was not the best meal that i've ever had in my life. when spending {just for one person} i guess i was expecting a tad bit more 'awe factor'. they definitely have a ton of hype which is great for business but maybe do some research before choosing to dine here! if you are not worried about money, come here you are sure to have a good meal."
237,Kim T.,1120,5,8/8/17,"i've only been to one other tasting menu before and gary danko takes the cake in my opinion. the service was exceptional and the food was out of this world. reservations were not that hard to get but we booked it a few weeks in advanced. so let us break it down we got the courses for person you can pick whatever you want from each section appetizer main dessert etc appetizer poached farm egg carbonara with braised bacon and brioche this one was okay, it tasted just like it would sound. the plating was beautiful! nothing that special about this one. salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon compote, toasted pistachios and country bread holy moly this was the best thing i have ever tasted, my taste buds were on fire. i have never had gras before so this being my first time it set the bar very high. it was so melt in your mouth delicious and you get a little bit of sweet with the compote ugh this is a must must must try if you get the chance to come here. fish & seafood roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon who does not like lobster and creamy dreamy potatoes. this was also a winner in my book, but i think the bass was better if i had to pick one. pan seared bass with eggplantfennel marmalade, broccoli rabe, shiitake mushrooms and soymustard glaze must try there is so much umami in this dish. the fresh fish, chewy shiitake mushrooms, and the soy glaze mixed all together is like an explosion in your mouth. salty and sweet, with earthy tones. i loveeeeeed this dish! game & meat seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter the steak cut like buttttaaaaaa, it was so good! the only thing i did not like was there was something that tasted like blue cheese and that totally threw me off guard. juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms, cipollini onions and wild nettle spatzle this one was ok in my opinion. it was kinda dry. overall i love this place you need to try this place out because you do not want to die not knowing how good this place is. totally worth the hype!!!"
238,Kara D.,1120,5,8/7/17,"dinner at gary danko was literally perfect and i loved everything i ordered. i could eat a tick off the table and be like, oh, daaaaanko you have done it again! .this is kinda an inside joke and you will % never find a tick there . dining with the coolest crew ever certainly did not hurt the situation shoutout to trish s, kris you, damien s, nikki w, jando s, and hailey p! the atmosphere was not as stuffy as we thought it would be we loved that the employees yucked it up with us. with an extensive and impressive menu, we were able to mix and match which items and courses we wanted. i ordered seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter strawberry souffle with strawberry sauce and strawberry sorbet. result everything was absolutely superb. a couple things that blew my mind, though, was the incredibly tender lobster , fluffy gnocchi, and the most beautiful and exquisite souffle i've ever seen. it was seriously dreamy and everything i hoped it would be i squealed. i cannot say it was the most innovative meal i've had, but it was all executed perfectly and there was not one tiny thing i did not enjoy. except maybe that one random sequined pillow. pro tip call months ahead of time to make a group reservation."
239,Angela H.,1120,5,6/28/17,"gary danko is an amazing restaurant! i celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here while we were visiting san francisco, and we were fortunate enough to be seated in a private booth for just us two! each table has red roses on it too, which made it quite romantic! service was beyond impeccable. there were multiple individuals servicing our table, which made the dinner go very smoothly. they cleared our tables quickly, checked in on us multiple times, served us without any lag time, and refilled our waters without having to ask. i got the course menu , and my boyfriend got the course menu . they served us each our plates, but we just shared our meals family style. thai soup amuse bouche with lobster it was very hearty, light, and flavorful. i wish they would have listed this as part of their menu because it was amazing, even better than some of their menu items. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, spring vegetables, and beech mushrooms most risottos are unbearably heavy and rich, but this was not. it actually reminded me of a thicker congee, so it was comforting to eat. they were also very generous with the shrimp and crab, which i really appreciated. glazed oysters with osetra caviar, white asparagus, leeks, and lettuce cream this was the perfect appetizer! the oysters were like little clouds in my mouth because it was just so fluffy and light. but if you are generally not a fan of oysters, i would not recommend it though because it does have a slight seafoody taste. roast maine lobster with potato puree, morel mushrooms, edamame, and tarragon the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the potato puree was a very flavorful mashed potato. i loved the broth that came with the plate! portion wise, this is a quite small plate, so just be aware if you are choosing this as an entree. coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster , scallops, candied peanuts, and shiitake mushrooms omg. this is a must order plate. it was the best dish of the night! you are initially served a plate of white rice, and one of the servers then places the seafood around the rice and then pours the coconut thai curry over the rice and seafood. the flavor is so amazing that i honestly wanted another plate or even two! it is just so light and comforting. all the seafood was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. pan seared scallops with english peamint puree, asparagus, fava beans, and beech mushrooms scallops were so perfectly cooked! the description also says fava beans, but i think i had lentils with mine. overall, really solid dish. soft she will crab with pancetta, roasted eggplant, cucumber and thai lime dressing this was more like two separate dishes placed onto one plate. the soft she will crab was extremely flavorful, and the herb salad on the side was very refreshing. it reminded me of the inside of a vietnamese spring roll. portion wise, this is also a small plate, so just be aware. roasted quail stuffed with mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa, and foie gras with baby artichokes and green garlic it does not say in the description, but it is served with a mini corn bread cake, which i loved! the quail was super adorable and petite. i thought it was pretty great but nothing too special. the quail drumsticks were probably the highlight of this dish. lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive, and port glazed cherries that duck breast was the definition of perfection. it was so well cooked and delicious. if you are not used to gamey meats, then beware that it is a tad more chewy than beef. as for the duck hash and all the sides, i could care less for them. those were just okay. trio creme brulee with assorted cookies there are creme brulee vanilla bean, brandy, and blueberry lemongrass. the vanilla is the classic one, and i just thought it was so yummy. the brandy one is a bit too rich and heavy, so i did not really enjoy it. the blueberry lemongrass one was a beautiful dark purple color, and it was tart in flavor. the assorted cookies were just okay. extra complimentary assorted dessert plate we received bitesized desserts that were all different in flavor. there was only one that i did not enjoy, which was the red jelly one. otherwise, i would recommend trying all of them because they were delicious. extra complimentary birthday chocolate mousse cake this was very sweet of them to bring out for my boyfriend's birthday. if you truly love the flavor of chocolate, then this is the dessert for you. it is not like the grocery market chocolate. it has a more rich, bitter chocolate flavor to it that is amazing on the palate. extra complimentary pineapple cheesecake muffin breakfast bread i love that they gave us something to bring home, especially since it was so convenient to eat the next morning before a flight. loved it! plus the wrapping was super cute!"
240,Julie L.,1120,3,6/26/17,"this place is three stars, at most. my boyfriend and i made our reservation two months in advance for our anniversary and although service was nice, the food was mediocre, at best. it is possible i came on a bad day.or i just do not have the palate for the food. this place has been on my foodie wish list for a long ass time. i've heard so many good things about it! so for two months, i looked forward to dining here and even planned out what i was going to order, lol. we ordered two cocktails and fourcourse meals, consisting of risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, spring vegetables and beech mushrooms this was creamy and rich as expected, filled with seafood, but i'm simply not a risotto person this was bf's choice seared foie gras with caramelized onions and cherries this was better than many of the things we ordered, but nothing to rave about roast maine lobster with potato puree, morel mushrooms, edamame and tarragon the lobster was cooked to perfection. a good portion, but missing something. coriander, black pepper and rosemary crusted tuna with piperade, spinach and anchovygarlic essence eh this was ok pan seared scallops with english peamint puree, asparagus, fava beans and beech mushrooms probably my favorite dish _ the scallops were huge and flavorful. herb crusted loin of lamb with spring vegetable tian and polenta was not memorable seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter this was probably the worst thing we ordered.there was literally no seasoning on the beef. it tasted so bland. juniper crusted bison with king trumpet mushrooms, cipollini onions and wild nettle spatzle meat was tender and flavorful, but eh. after finishing our food, we were given a small plate of assorted baked goods, which we appreciated, but we did not receive the complementary celebration cake mousse with a candle that everyone else has mentioned note that i included in our reservation that this was to celebrate our anniversary . that left a sour taste in my mouth because i saw other tables receive it. aside from all of the above, the only thing that deserves stars is their service they were very attentive and refilled our waters most of the time and gave us bread. i appreciated that while i was in the restroom, they brought our food and they put an old dutch lid on our dishes until i came out. we also got two baked goods to take home for the next day, which was nice. but again, mediocre at best. none of the items we ordered stood out. so it makes me wonder do you come here for the food or for the service not to mention, my boyfriend felt sick all night after eating gary danko.so we are definitely not coming back. terribly disappointed with our experience."
241,Faye M.,1120,5,10/24/18,"gary danko was one of those places my then boyfriend now husband and i dreamed of dining in. we were in our very early s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my th birthday and booked a table here. we had a pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. we arrived mins early and were seated right away. they sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. as our host said, great seats for people watching. my husband and i chose the course meal and i love how you are not limited to each section of the menu. there were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. we each ordered an appetizer, seafood and meat dishes. the food was soooo good. a lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time. we ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef , stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. the dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. we did not feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. at the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. they also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch. overall, my husband and i had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining and fanciest experiences to date. it was a great way to celebrate my birthday! we left the restaurant at almost midnight. those hours flew by and we did not even realize it because we were having such a great time. no phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. we will definitely be back."
242,Lindsey S.,1120,5,9/6/18,"gary danko is hands down my favorite restaurant in san francisco. i have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. if you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you. the first time we came, we did courses each. we left and we are absolutely stuffed like barely breathing , so ever since we have opted for four. i will start with the service first off, i'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it is empty. secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm. if that is not great service then i do not know what is. lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. when i dine there i truly feel like i am treated like royalty, which is nice when you are dropping a lot of money. then there is the food. i could go on and on but instead i will share my dishes from my most recent visit appetizer the risotto. i'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because i typically go in july every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful. fish roast main lobster with potato puree. hands down my favorite dish with the exception of dessert, which we will get to soon. meat seared filet of beef . good steak. probably my least favorite of the bunch but not because it is not good, the other dishes are just spectacular. cheese they roll out a cart and let you select a few. dessert warm louisiana butter cake. this is no joke. my boyfriend and i literally talk about this more often than people should. hands down the best dessert i've ever had in my life. i would pay for this alone. when you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. overall, you will spend a lot of money but it is so worth it."
243,Dan L.,1120,5,9/3/18,"the two of us came here for a big anniversary on a weeknight. i had heard about it when it opened long ago and have been wanting to try it. interesting location a couple of blocks off of fisherman's wharf. i liked the option of choosing either a , or course meal , , or . she went with a glutenfree courses, and i went for . the menu had a lot of good choices creative appetizers, fish seafood, meat and game birds. i had glazed oysters topped with caviar, roasted scallops, horseradish crusted salmon, and filet of beef . everything was excellent and the flavors were outstanding. she had risotto with shrimp and seared bass, and she was equally happy, too. i had the lemon souffle cake for dessert and we finished with americanos. the interior is nice, but the seating is a bit cramped. the service was excellent. good wine list, and we ordered a couple of glasses, and they let you even taste them first! i would definitely come back, i do not give very many stars."
244,Diane L.,1120,3,8/21/18,"i've had this restaurant on my bucketlist for the longest time. went this past sunday since my friend wanted to treat so i could not pass that up. our reservation was for pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. a little behind turned into being a minute wait. the manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. that was a nice gesture, but what would have been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. just my preference vs the free champagne small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons of soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing it was ok. i really wanted to fall in love with this place but it is overhyped for sure. my favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops, seared foie gras, dungeoness crab salad, and all the desserts flambeed cheeries with tres leches cake, lemon souflee cake, and the pineapple cake they give you to take home . the filet of beef was meh the sides on there tasted better and the lemon pepper duck was ok as well, what the heck gary danko maybe my expectations were too high. also, the seared ahi tuna had wayyy too much lemon soy dressing on there. i'm kinda glad i did not have to pay for this meal i did not think it was that worth it to me. such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner i was thinking that i would rather go to house of prime rib lol. overall, i did not come super hungry, but i thought the portions are a little small for my liking. nice presentation and service here, but i think this was just a one time thing for me. for example, it is like seeing someone hot. you just want to hit it and quit it. so basically aka being able to say you went to gary danko to eat just to say you did it."
245,Cartman P.,1120,5,8/4/18,"gary danko never fails to deliver nothing but perfection, from the food, the presentation, the service, and the atmosphere. where can i begin. food this was our rd or th time we came to gary danko. i am amazed that the quality of food and execution has not changed a bit compared to years ago, which i find it rare in this city. they offer fabulous selection of menu and the only hard part is that you do not know what to order without getting your brains tangled up. this time and i think every time in the past. i had . seared ahi tuna melts like butter and perfectly and lightly flavored with lemon soy dressing. very light and pleasant appetizer to start your meal. . roast main lobster the lobster is perfectly cooked and very plumped, and nicely balanced with smooth potato puree and chanterelle mushrooms. . seared filet of beef the filet was cooked perfect medium rare, tender, buttery, juicy. just everything you ask for in a perfect stake. . last but certainly not least, the one and only, baked chocolate souffle. at this point i am pretty full with plates and a cocktail, but this is the finale what i always look forward to! i love the little presentation from a waiter pouring the two separate sauces in front of you, first with vanilla bean cream and second with dark belgian chocolate sauce. the souffle is incredibly fluffy and soft, never too rich or too sweet, but the sophisticated chocolate flavor will just take you to another world. service the best, top notch, attentive service you can ever ask for. all staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly. last time what i was impressed the most was how attentive they are. they must be a hybrid with hawk, and these eyes are watching you at all time. i spilled the chocolate souffle on my jacket hanging on my legs, and one second later before i even finished saying oh nooooo, someone already flew out to me with cleaning wipes to help me clean. this time, when i arrived at the restaurant i asked for the restroom, and this nice gentleman went out of his way to escort me to the restroom. what a nice gesture to make your visit just even better than perfect. we have tried quince, la folie, alexander. but i think gary danko is my favorite of all time. i absolutely cannot wait to go back again!"
246,Helen Y.,1120,5,7/31/18,"our friend from the bay area wanted to take us somewhere unique with good food. gary danko did not disappoint from entering the restaurant to drinks at the bar to our meal and dessert. the staff was awesome, always professional and friendly. the ambiance is warm and inviting. the decor is settle and tastefully done. our waiter offered a purse hanger so that i had somewhere to put my handbag while we enjoyed our experience. i started with the rose champagne, a little pricey buy delicious and refreshing. we all ordered the option meal. they have a tasting menu with their most popular items and an option to add wine to each dish. they also have options where you can chose , , or course meal. what you would do is pick a dish from their menu, it can be any combination you would like. my starter was asparagus cold soup to cleanse the palate. then i ordered the risotto with rock shrimp, lobster, and crab meat. delicious!!! the dish was prepared with a wonderful combination of taste and the presentation was beautiful. next i had the thai coconut curry and seafood dish. the curry was super light and tasty as well. then i had the seared filet of beef made medium. this dish was a little disappointing, the meat was over cooked and a little tough. the waiter was very attentive and offered to make me another dish, but i declined because i did not want to waste food. the bread man was always at our table filling out bread plate. upon seeing it, did not look as good as it taste! the bread was warm, soft, and oh so yummy! lastly for dessert i had the butter cake. by now i was quite full and could not finish my dessert, but it was moist and not too sweet. my overall experience at gary danko was a+. i would love to come again next time we are in the bay area."
247,Eric W.,1120,5,6/19/18,"first time for us at this well known establishment and they did not disappoint. came here for wife's birthday. choose , , or courses from a bevy of options. or, choose the chef's taster option. food was great and staff, from servers to host, was great too. really enjoyed the shrimp crab risotto and sea bass. filet of beef was also delicious. our server prepared a perfect cherry flambe. would definitely recommend and return."
248,Bailey Z.,1120,4,5/30/18,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains, the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef , which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake. as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."
249,Andrew C.,1120,4,5/24/18,"service ambiance food overall experience for this visit would be . stars, but i will round up to until i return for another experience. came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. we arrived separately my family arrived ~ mins before scheduled time they got sited right away, which was nice , i arrived ~ mins late to the reservation. when i arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, i had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table. after i've sat down, we waited at least ~ mins before our waiter checkedin with us and started explaining the menu. i understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but i'm shocked that they waited almost mins before they stopped by. maybe they did not notice that i have arrived or forgot that we have yet to order our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checkedin with us a couple times throughout the meal. however the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of good service . she was doing everything super fast pouring water way too fast splashing water everywhere , putting or more like throwing bread down on your plate. fast service is part of good service, but not all of it i was constantly distracted surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. the sommelier who came to help us was even worse. he was rude and had an attitude that he did not want to help us maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at he told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but did not return until mins later during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle. i will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout. the ambiance was not that great either. table arrangements are pretty crowed waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through and background noise is pretty loud to the point where i have to lean in for the person across me to hear me , not what i expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a michelin star. there are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance. the food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food i order try. risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms roast maine lobster with potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared sea scallops with english pea puree, leek fondue, mint and shimeji mushrooms seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with israeli couscous, green garlic, spring onions and english peas lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and huckleberry bordelaise "
250,C Y.,1120,5,5/22/18,"loved it! i came to celebrate a friend's birthday and everything i ordered was solid. the ambiance, service and food were perfection. our party of enjoyed the private dining room that night. courses foie gras since i ordered a dish from each section appetizer, meat, dessert , my foie gras was generously sized. i enjoyed every bite of this! seared filet of beef it was cooked nicely but did not blow my mind. wish i had gone with the duck or lamb. cheesecake delicious! i probably would not have ordered this though had i known about the complimentary assorted minidesserts. conclusion highly recommend! i loved my experience here and cannot wait to try the rest of the menu."
251,Lala B.,1120,5,5/19/18,"superb. went here on a date, good place to impress a gal. i had the best hostess, my napkin was placed over my lap wink wink lol, and the most tender & juicy seared filet of beef . but definitely try the roast lobster and potato puree, not to big, punches with flavor. for dessert we had an assortment of small tasty delights!"
252,Annie L.,1120,4,5/12/18,"gary at gary danko! took my boyfriend gary out for his th birthday dinner here as we have been saving this spot for a special occasion. food courses pan seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, garlic confit, tomato and basil roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream we also had the following complimentary dishes special soup from the chef, assorted dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. take home complimentary pineapple cream cheesecake. service great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care of the whole night. however, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members of the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. many times, i had a member of the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. i felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort of taken away. would i come back again i'm willing to give them another try. was i full off of the main courses noi had small scallops and small lobster tails. boyfriend had the beef and we shared the cake. i was filled up off of the butter cake, dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. alot of sweets as fillers but was not full off of the actual courses. would recommend for special occasions, for the ambiance and delicious food."
253,Holly E.,1120,5,4/10/18,"restaurant gary danko was delicious and you will not leave hungry. we got the three course meal for . i had the risotto with rock shrimp, crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms, roast main lobster, and filet of beef with potato gnocchi. my boyfriend had the coconut thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, and mushrooms, filet of beef , and creme fraiche cheesecake. we had two drinks each and the bill with tip, taxes, and whatever else ca and sf add ended up around . so know what you are getting into before you go so that you do not have a horrible surprise when you leave! i like that you can customize your , , or courses choosing from any section of the menu. meaning, you could get options from the dessert section or filets of beef if you so choose. i'm not a dessert person and was thrilled to not be forced to have that as a course as so many other places do. they will modify the portion sizing depending on what you are ordering. so if you get two appetizers and a filet , the filet will be larger in size than if you were to get two other meat options with the filet . in my opinion, the gnocchi was the best thing i tasted. i would have preferred all gnocchi and no filet ! the steak was okay. my boyfriend who is not as into food as i am raved about the cheesecake and actually called his meal out of this world. a phrase i do not believe i've ever heard him utter. we were happy with the portion sizes its not like the commercial of the couple who go to the fancy restaurant and have to stop at the convenience store on the way home to get more food. but, considering you are paying for each course, you should be full! nice touch to send everyone home with a wonderful pineapple sponge cake for the next day. delicious!! no jacket required for men, but dress up anyways and have a great night out!"
254,Andrew S.,1120,5,4/1/18,"finally came for an overdue visit to gary danko's. it seems almost impossible to get an opentable reservation at a decent time here so i decided to show up at pm on a sunday as a walkin. i immediately got seated at the bar where they also served the full , or item prix fixe or tasting menu. the food here is solid and french great ingredients transformed into dishes that are perfectly executed. i chose items surf oysters with caviar, branzini , turf seared foie, filet of beef and the perfect dessert lemon souffle cake with mignardises. at the end of the meal, they gave me a small cake to take home. i really appreciate the variety and number of items in their menu i'm a little tired of set tasting menus at the moment . i also like that this restaurant gives you a lot of bread yes i used it to soak up lots of the sauces . tom, the bartender, was the perfect host for my meal. he did a fantastic and fun job making nonalcoholic pairings for me. hospitality was excellent. as for the ambiance, it is very old san francisco probably time for a remodel and the place is a bit dark and feels very dated when compared to the other michelinstarred restaurants in sf. i would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining who is visiting fisherman's wharf. the attire is business casual dark jeans ok but i saw a really good range of clothing when i visited, particularly from tourists who look like they just finished a whole day of sightseeing in sf. i look forward to my next visit to try the other items on the enormous menu."
255,Janice L.,1120,5,3/25/18,"i want to start off by saying that every single thing i tasted was delicious and well worth what i paid. my boyfriend and i made a last minute attempt to get reservations for our anniversary and were lucky enough to snag a table around pm on a weekday night only days in advance. we arrived a little early and were invited to wait at the bar in the meantime, though we opted not to as the bar area was quite packed that night. speaking of packed, the restaurant is not all that large from what i could tell and so the volume is pretty high, just a fair warning. i honestly do not pay too much attention to service and so i'm just going to skip that and go right into the menu and the food. i really loved the structure of the menu as it allowed my boyfriend and i to try a great variety. you do not have to choose one appetizer, one main, one dessert, etc. if you want to choose all meats go ahead! if you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth and want to order just desserts by all means go for it!! my boyfriend and i each chose a course meal and our selections were oysters, seared foie gras, lobster, duck, quail, & filet of beef we went the meat, meat, and more meat route . the oysters were wonderfully sweet with a beautiful pop of flavor from the caviar. the foie gras was by far my favorite and was not only wonderfully rich, but quite largely portioned as well though not large enough to share with a ravenous boyfriend, i would probably order two of these next time!! . the lobster was flavorful and had an almost buttery texture to it that we really enjoyed this plate would end up being my least favorite though, because i just felt like the other things on the plate did not really complement the lobster . all the meats were incredibly tender and paired well with their accompaniments, especially the quail, and all three were fairly large portions. at the end of the meal, we were treated with an extremely rich chocolate dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary and were also given a small plate of sweets as well as a parting gift a delicious pumpkin and cream cheese muffin . all in all, we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come again!!"
256,Matt L.,1120,4,3/23/18,"of course, this place is pretty good. but frankly, i think it is a bit overhyped and amazed how hard it was to get a reservation. i went here with a good friend, and we both really enjoyed the seared ahi tuna with avocada as well as the filet of beef . the presentation and service were also top notch."
257,Diana A.,1120,5,2/26/18,"i always tell my kids you know you are at a fancy restaurant when they sweep the crumbs off the table. well kids they definitely sweep them off here! gary danko happened to be at the top of my list on my recent foodie trip to sf. i have heard of people making reservations months in advance with some only getting a pm time slot. however, luck was on my side when the concierge at the ritz carlton scored me a reservation same day with a pm time slot!!! i wanted my kids to experience their first michelin star restaurant so i could not be more thrilled! we arrived much earlier than our reservation but they took us anyway. we had a nice table at the main dining area where the bar is. i would say the tables are close but not so close you can hear the conversations nearby. the ordering system is pretty simple. you can pick any items from the menu. you have the freedom to choose anything you want.if you want desserts or even steaks you can order just that! my two cents order mainly fish meats and skip the desserts. they will give you a free sampler of mini desserts at the end and a complimentary one you are celebrating a special occasion. they also give everyone a free small soup. just things to keep in mind before ordering. here are the items i ordered seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples i have never tried duck liver before. to me it just tasted like a super buttery piece of fat. it was not exciting. pan seared bass with israeli couscous, broccoli, glazed turnips and radish if bass is on the menu i will always order it. however this one was a bit more stiff to my liking. i prefer the bass that is delicate and melts in your mouth. nonetheless it was still good. seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter i ordered this for my kids as they love steak. they enjoyed it but it is not something i would have ordered. herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula my favorite dish of the evening! the lamb was deliciously tender and moist. the dates added a bit of sweetness. with over items on the menu it was tough picking just ! i am looking forward to coming back to try different items on the menu. this is one of the more reasonably priced michelin star restaurants i have dined at. if you do not order alcohol you can easily have an affordable nice dining experience here. service is perfect as expected. you have about people waiting on your every move. when you leave to use the restroom your napkin has magically been folded and hanging on your chair when you return. they even provide purse holders for the ladies. do not forget to take home the muffins they give you at end. seriously the best you will ever have! tasted perfect with my morning coffee! thank you gary danko! this was definitely the highlight on our trip to sf!"
258,Sydney C.,1120,4,2/19/18,"i came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday a little early. pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. it was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. they offer valet service for if you are not lucky with parking. the restaurant's exterior was not what i had imagined for some reason. you could not see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. we were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. it was very elegant inside. we came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to patagonia a block away. our reservation time was which was when they opened. i was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. that was fast. you have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a course meal. we went for the course meal. what i loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of anything. it does not necessarily have to go in what you would think as the proper sequence appetizer, entree, dessert , although you could do it that way if you wanted to. it could be four entrees. all lobster if you wanted! i skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh. originally i had ordered four entrees, but when i got to my third course, i started getting a bit full. luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef i had ordered. the waiter recommended getting a dessert when i was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but i definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. he knew all along, ha. anyways what i had ordered was the roast maine lobster, seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. i think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. both were so tender. although the lobster was good such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster i had at that buffet in reno omg , lobster never seems to wow me just because i've never been a huge fan of it. my boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. his coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. i definitely would not have ordered dessert as my fourth course if i knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend. at the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. they were banana cream cheese cakes i believe! honestly, i would have been content with a course meal. it was too much food for one night! i guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are. food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. service was top notch. that is the one thing that stood out the most for me. water was refilled almost instantly. and so was the bread. i found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. they were so on top of everything, i loved it! definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"
259,Elise F.,1120,5,2/3/18,"our experience here was excellent from beginning to the end! loved it! i've been wanting to come here for awhile now and i finally went. my boyfriend and i had a reservation on a friday night at pm. luckily, we were able to find a parking spot right across ghirardelli square which is about a minute walk to the restaurant. if you are not able to find parking, this restaurant does valet for . we arrived minutes early for our reservation but got seated right away. service is on point here! they do not rush you to order, they constantly refill your water without having to ask, refill bread on your plate once you run out, and change your utensils each time a new course comes out even if you did not use the utensils . the meals are set from courses , courses or courses . the food is set by appetizers , fish and seafood , meat and game birds , cheese , and dessert . you can choose the food you want from any section. they start you off with a soup before your courses. my boyfriend and i went with the courses. the food we got were appetizers seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, root vegetables, sage and beech mushrooms fish and seafood seared sea scallops with lentils, roasted peppers, potatoes, parsley and madras curry vinaigrette meats and game birds seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter herb crusted loin of lamb with farrotto, medjool dates, rainbow carrots and green chermoula dessert baked chocolate souffle with two sauces we enjoyed every bite of our food! the food was cooked perfectly and had nice presentations to them. after we finished our food, they gave us a plate of little yummy treats. since it was my birthday, they also gave a complimentary dessert. i think it was lemon cake, not too sure but it was good! after that, we got another complimentary thing which was banana cream cheese bread to eat for breakfast. everything was great, we will definitely be back! try this place out if you have not yet. definitely worth it! do not forget to make a reservation in advance!"
260,Katherine C.,1120,5,1/24/18,"alright, this is going to be a long review, but mainly because i have to discuss every aspect. me and my bf did the course meal, because we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we do not get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. most people would probably do fine with the courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. before i forget valet parking is but you can definitely find street parking nearby although it may be a limit of hours in terms of menu items seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples !!!! omg this was the tastiest thing i have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. it was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things i picked risotto with rock shrimp . i'm not sure if i'm a fan of risotto, i may not be as i thought this was a little salty. my bf however thought it was really really good! seared scallops !! these scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. i felt like i was eating a meal from hells kitchen lol. there was also this thing in the middle that i could not tell what it was, some sort of potato cake it was super good too. i could not exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you are going here. horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce the salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good because it was not dry like other salmons you would have at other restaurants. i like dill so i automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. i enjoyed the scallops more though. roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo !!! this was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! i thought the quail would be too much work but it was not and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!! lemon pepper duck breast with pears the duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf because it felt like it did not go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway lol. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. i think if the crabcake did not throw me off i would have given this a though. herb crusted loin of lamb with dates this was a lot better than i was thinking! i do not like lamb much but this dish did not taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here. seared filet of beef with gnocci both me and my bf did not really enjoy this too much, but i think its because we realized we do not like filet . it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that is about it. flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it is an extra but definitely worth it. grand marnier souffle this did not impress me and i guess it just felt like too much egg white or maybe i just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much lol so i would recommend the other desserts. espresso martini this was definitely a unique drink that i recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini. besides the food, even though i did not think every dish was , service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and that was enough for me to give on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around but that was mainly bc we got drinks and got the course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job! overall get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"
261,Lindsey S.,1120,5,9/6/18,"gary danko is hands down my favorite restaurant in san francisco. i have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. if you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you. the first time we came, we did courses each. we left and we are absolutely stuffed like barely breathing , so ever since we have opted for four. i will start with the service first off, i'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it is empty. secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm . if that is not great service then i do not know what is. lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. when i dine there i truly feel like i am treated like royalty, which is nice when you are dropping a lot of money. then there is the food. i could go on and on but instead i will share my dishes from my most recent visit appetizer the risotto. i'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because i typically go in july every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful. fish roast main lobster with potato puree. hands down my favorite dish with the exception of dessert, which we will get to soon. meat seared filet of beef. good steak. probably my least favorite of the bunch but not because it is not good, the other dishes are just spectacular. cheese they roll out a cart and let you select a few. dessert warm louisiana butter cake . this is no joke. my boyfriend and i literally talk about this more often than people should. hands down the best dessert i've ever had in my life. i would pay for this alone. when you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. overall, you will spend a lot of money but it is so worth it."
262,Marjolein v.,1120,5,8/19/18,"what an incredible experience, start to finish. the service, the food, the ambiance, everything was nothing short of amazing. even if i wanted to i could not think of one negative thing to say. from the second we walked in we were treated like royalty. i could not imagine a better place to celebrate my birthday. my husband ordered the seared ahi tuna, the pork tenderloin, a selection of cheeses and the louisiana butter cake . all delicious according to him, i would not know because he ate it all before i could steal a bite! good sign. i myself had the corn soup, beef filet, and treated myself to two desserts hey, i'm pregnant what else is a girl to do . the trio of creme brulee was great. the proverbial cherry on top however were the flambeed cherries on tres leches cake , pun intended. the whole restaurant stopped eating to enjoy the show, when our waiter brought over a special grill cart to flambe the cherries right at our table. yes, this place is definitely pricy. is it worth it however every last penny if you ask me."
263,Jeremy R.,1120,5,6/18/18,"so firstly, why no pictures of the food, you might ask , and i would say that i really had nothing material to add to all that already exists on yelp. what really made the evening memorable, as much as the food, was the care and attention given to our service. yes the food was amazing, but you already knew that. we had oysters with caviar, lobster, duck, bison, quail, scallops, softshell crab, risotto, bronzini, thai seafood curry, lemon semifreddo and louisiana butter cake . each dish was spectacular, unique, perfectly prepared and presented. the only disappointment was the signature chocolate souffle with two sauces which was a little soupy. we had called a few days before or reservation and let the restaurant know that we were celebrating our daughter's college graduation. not only did they write a congratulatory message on the semifreddo plate and put a candle in it, they went so far as to print a personalized menu with a the occasion on it. so sweet and amazing. the whole experience was a . our server jared was amazingly attentive, friendly and informative as was every person who provided service to our table. in a town of hipster restaurants, some quite excellent, it is refreshing to dine at a restaurant where the dining experience is as important as the food. thank you gary danko for making our special evening truly special!"
264,Bailey Z.,1120,4,5/30/18,"gary danko has been a san francisco institution for nearly two decades. it has been on my list of places to try for ten years. it does not look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic french technique. we came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, i'm glad i finally got to try it. the menu concept is interesting as you can choose between , , and course tasting menus. the interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. one of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people we do not drink much . although his eventual recommended wine was good, we did not appreciate his judgmental attitude. as for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. while the risotto was good, the flavors were very onenote, but loved the shrimp and crab. the salt cured foie gras torchon with meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. the foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. for mains, the roast maine lobster is a signature dish that is a musttry. it is both elegant and a classic. for my last entree, i tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly was not gamey at all. i also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef, which was cooked perfectly. the roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish. we skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm louisiana butter cake . as with many fine dining restaurants, i was not as impressed by the dessert. the butter cake was not as moist as the one i've had at maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, did not have my favorite flavors. the night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. the ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. with so many consistent years of food and service, it is no wonder it has retained its one star michelin."
265,Annie L.,1120,4,5/12/18,"gary at gary danko! took my boyfriend gary out for his th birthday dinner here as we have been saving this spot for a special occasion. food courses pan seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, garlic confit, tomato and basil roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, edamame and tarragon seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream we also had the following complimentary dishes special soup from the chef, assorted dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake . take home complimentary pineapple cream cheesecake. service great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care of the whole night. however, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members of the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. many times, i had a member of the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. i felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort of taken away. would i come back again i'm willing to give them another try. was i full off of the main courses noi had small scallops and small lobster tails. boyfriend had the beef and we shared the cake . i was filled up off of the butter cake , dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake . alot of sweets as fillers but was not full off of the actual courses. would recommend for special occasions, for the ambiance and delicious food."
266,Lindsay H.,1120,4,4/20/18,the service was good and the food is good but not as good as i expected. i had better souffle at other places.the warm louisiana butter cake is pretty good. the duck is not juicy enough for median rare and the i do not like the fried branzini. the price is fair.
267,Sharon Q.,1120,4,1/30/17,"came here for our th year wedding anniversary! my only disappointment was the valet guy. he was on his phone and we had to walk over to him and be the first one to say something before he looked up and took our keys. slightly disappointing first impression and not sure if they outsource their valet service. but when we actually walked in.everything went uphill from there. the host took my coat and seated us promptly. we met our waitress, suzanne, right away and was given a good explanation of their menu and items. my husband and i both opted for the course dinner and we chose the following for winfred seared foie gras with caramelized onions and apples roast maine lobster with potato puree, white beech mushrooms, edamame and tarragon roasted pork tenderloin and belly with butternut squash puree, apples, chestnuts and bacon flambeed pineapple upside down cake with almonds and vanilla ice cream. for me dungeness crab salad with mango, hearts of palm, lolla rossa, and madras curry vinaigrette risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, squash and shimeji mushrooms roasted quail stuffed with mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa and foie gras with fingerling potatoes and porcini cream warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream. every dish was delicious and exquisite but my top favorites are the foie gras, the risotto, and the warm louisiana butter cake . another thing i wanted to point out its a great place to celebrate and they have such wonderful service from start entering the door to end."
268,Robert P.,1120,5,1/14/17,"amazing. simply amazing. but do not get the creme brulee. personally, i did not like the rum flavor. but the louisiana butter cake was out of this world."
269,Grace L.,1120,5,11/28/16,"gary danko. what more is there to say with more than reviews and it being stars my husband and i came here to celebrate our year wedding anniversary and it was absolute perfection. we ordered the four course meal and it was the right amount for each of us. as an appetizer we tried the risotto with rock shrimp, dungeness crab, pumpkin, shimeji mushrooms and sage and the dungeness crab salad with melons, cucumbers, roasted eggplant and thai mango dressing. both were great starters to our meal. for our fish and seafood selection we went with the pan seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, garlic confit, tomato and basil and roast maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, edamame and tarragon. so good! with our meat and game selection lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and cardamom poached pears and the seared filet of beef with potato gnocchi, olive oil, swiss chard and stilton butter . i highly recommend the lemon pepper duck breast i've never tasted anything like it and it was delicious! and finally for our dessert, we shared the lemon souffle cake with creme fraiche panna cotta and raspberry sorbet and the warm louisiana butter cake with apples, huckleberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream. both were excellent ways to end our fantastic meal. gary danko. you deserve a million gold stars!"
270,Pierre B.,1120,5,9/16/16,"absolutely amazing. this is definitely a top food experience of my life. my wife and i each ordered the five course meal. even though we were totally stuffed afterwards, we simply would not have been able to forego any of the courses, they were each so unforgettable. each of my courses seared ahi seared scallops bison steak cheese plate and louisiana butter cake and my wife's courses poached farm egg with sweetbreads lobster duck breast cheese plate and peanut butter bar were each completely different but completely excellent in their own way. every ingredient in each perfectly complemented the other. we have never had better cheeses we each asked the waiter to surprise us from their selection of cheeses , even at a michelin starred restaurant in paris. the only very minor negative was the decor. it is oldfashioned, dark and and little foreboding."
271,Jesse P.,1120,5,6/7/16,"took my wife here for our anniversary and we had a nice experience. the staff was all very friendly though one kid who was pouring water looked like he was scared to death of making a mistake. i kind of felt bad for him. the only issue with the staff i had was at times they would reach over me in an awkward way. the food was really good but what blew me away was the portion size. i'm used to tasting menus being small items, just a few bites. for instance i ordered the horseradish encrusted salmon medallion. seeing medallion i was expecting a very small bite or two. when it arrived it was a significant piece of meat. we also had the filet, risotto, cheese selection, and warm louisiana cake . the risotto was hands down the highlight of the night. so creamy and the flavors were fantastic. i would love to go back for more bowls of that. the filet was good but it is not my favorite cut of beef. still very good. my wife absolutely loved the louisiana cake recommended by the staff. i opted to have our waitress choose the cheeses for me and she brought everything i love, it was fantastic. my only regret was i ate too much and was so full i could not finish the cheese. the portion sizes are huge and i must say for what you are paying for everything i felt like it was a great deal, so worth the money."
272,Monica W.,1120,5,3/27/16,"my boyfriend and i made reservations months ahead and yet the only available time that was available for our anniversary was at pm. let me first off by saying you real need to make reservations ahead of time right when the times rolls around otherwise you will not be able to get reservations the week of. it was packed when we arrived. parking was not too bad for us luckily. we found meter parking by ghirardelli. we got here around pm, the doorman opened the door for us and here we were at gary danko. the hostess took my coat and told us to wait by the bar since our table was not ready yet. my boyfriend and i ordered non alcoholic drink and they were tasty. i cannot remember what they were but my boyfriend's drink had some sparkling orange drink and i had some lemon daiquiri. it was around and the host came to get us and told us the table was ready. we were seated and gave us the menu. the waiter was super attentive, nice, funny and handsome! my bf and i had the course meal. it was around per person and it was worth it. my bf ordered the ahi tuna appetizer , seabass, seared filet beef, and the louisiana butter cake . for me, i had the risotto with shrimp, roast main lobster, pork belly and then the creme brulee! all of our dishes were just fabulous. my risotto was just perfect and tasty. lobster was on point and juicy. the meat just came right off the she will. pork belly was chewy and tasty. the trio creme brulee was perfect and it came with different cookies. service was great. the waiter came by to check on us every so often. cannot forget about the water guy. he came around refilling our water plenty of times lol which was nice. everyone who works here was super nice and caring. at the end, when our desserts came out, the waiter came back again and gave us a chocolate cake with some small sweets. it was such a lovely gesture and they even wrote happy anniversary on the plate. i did not think they would actually treat us by doing all this even though i wrote on the note section when making the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary but did not expect this!! you guys are awesome! finally after receiving our check, they gave us each banana cheesecake to bring home. i have not ate it yet but i will tomorrow but i'm sure it would be good. i cannot wait to come back here again!!!!"
273,Joy W.,1120,5,2/17/16,"i came here a few years ago and still have fond memories of the meal. dinner was excellent & service was exquisite. though some ingredients have changed, the classic menu remains fundamentally unchanged. it can be difficult getting a reservation. you cannot make a reservation on opentable. you must call or email, & get a confirmation number. reservations cannot be made more than two months in advance. needless to say, plan ahead. we had reservations, but somehow the hostess had us down for a different time. mistakes happen, but it seemed like she thought we were at fault. i guess it is always best to confirm reservations a day prior to showing up to the restaurant. no matter, we were seated not too long afterwards. the restaurant is rather dark & cozy. a little too cozy as we audibly heard a neighboring diner who made chide remarks about our allblack attire. it was actually really funny overhearing this. what can i say we did not plan our outfits very well. for the rest of the evening, service was amazing. the servers really make you feel taken care of here. overall, i give gary danko a , w the exception of the reservation discrepancy. you can choose courses from the appetizer, seafood, meat, cheese & dessert menus. the serving sizes are each a very goodsized portion. pricing currently course course course for the most bang for your buck, i encourage you to get steaks for . appetizers seared foie gras w caramelized onions & apples seared to a golden brown & melts in your mouth like butter . it is like eating straight up fat, but ohsogood anyway. the caramelized onions & apples add sweet & tart flavors to cut through the heavy richness of the foie gras. crispy farm egg w grits, royal trumpet mushrooms, frisee who does not love a poached egg got the image in your head now take that poached egg, bread it, fry it, & serve it over some greens. i always find it so satisfying to break into runny egg yolk. a little egg yolk over frisee actually makes a pretty nice dressing. risotto w lobster, gulf shrimp, shimeji mushrooms & butternut squash creamy w big chunks of lobster & shrimp spread throughout. the consistency of the rice was a little more broken up than i am used to for risotto. seafood roast maine lobster w potato puree, black trumpet mushrooms, corn & tarragon chunks of claw meat resting in the she will, adorned w a sprig of tarragon that looks like it is growing out of the lobster. seared tuna w peppers & onions mildly flavored strips of tuna over a light sauce. it was an interesting combination, but not the most memorable tuna i've had. meat seared filet of beef w cremini mushrooms, braised shallots & potato cake beautifully petite filet cooked to a pinkinthecenter medium rare over a sweet & savory sauce, accompanied w a breaded & fried potato cake . the current beef filet comes with a rich & creamy square of potato gratin. roast quail stuffed w mushroom ragout, leeks, quinoa, foie gras, on ham hocks & maitake w corn cake one of the better quail dishes i've had. quail tends to be dry, but the stuffing enhances the flavors & juices of the bird. the corn cake was topped w corn salsa. dessert baked chocolate souffle w sauces it was beautifully presented. the server poured the the chocolate & custard sauces into the center of the souffle w ease. i wish i had captured a photo prior to the sauces being applied to the souffle. the texture was light, yet creamy, but the tasted so rich. warm louisiana butter cake w apples, huckleberry compote &vanilla bean ice cream i did not think butter cake sounded too interesting, but it was still delicious w baked apple slices on top for fruity sweetness. the huckleberry compote added some acidity to the overall rich & buttery dessert. complimentary dessert assortment little tea cookies, brownies, fruit jellies & things as if we did not already consume enough dessert, we were also presented w a little cheesecake topped w raspberry & a single elongated candle to celebrate our special occasion. last but not least, we were given their signature complimentary takeout dessert, which i believe is a souffle, but i'm not sure i never got to open it. had i known we were going to be consuming so many sweet desserts, i might have gone w the artisanal cheeses presented tableside. the dishes that really stood out to me were the crispy farm egg, lobster risotto, & chocolate souffle. if i came back, i would definitely like to try the oysters w caviar. though pricey, i would say gary danko's prices pale in comparison to many other fine dining establishments. it is a wonderful restaurant to dip your toes into the fine dining pool."
274,Tammy N.,1120,5,2/14/16,"make sure to make reservations months in advance! we came here at for our pm reservation & did valet parking for +tip. upon entering, we were greeted by the host, checked in, and waited about minutes until someone else came and took us to our table. we were asked if we wanted a wine or cocktail list & served our choice of water. one of the waiters came by and served us some bread we got unlimited bread without having to ask until our plates were taken away . we ordered moscow mules which were delicious!! it was probably one of the best i've ever had and i order them everywhere i go. so, how it works here is you are given the choice to order a , , or course meal. we originally were going to do the course meal which was an appetizer, a meat course, seafood course, cheese plate, and dessert, but we got too stuffed mid meal so our server took the cheese course off our meal! to start, i ordered the seared foie gras which was amazing. it was perfectly buttery and the sauce that went along with it was perfect and did not overpower the dish. next, i had the coconut thai curry which came with scallops, shrimp, lobster, and calamari over a bed of rice. all of the seafood were cooked to perfection and i liked how they gave you less rice and more seafood. thumbs up to that! and! the scallops were big and not those little skimpy ones. moving forward, i had the filet of beef which came with some potatoes. the filet came cooked to perfectionmedium rare. most times when i ask for medium rare, my steak is still mooing. hello. i do not want to eat a live cow on my plate! lastly, we finished off with our dessert. i had the louisiana butter cake & my boyfriend had the cheesecake and they were both amazing! not too sweet and the ice cream that came with it paired very well. i will definitely be back. awesome food, awesome service."
275,Aub B.,1120,5,12/2/15,"first time diner at gary danko. was welcomed by an extremely professional and friendly staff. they were all knowledgable and prompt with their service which was very refreshing to experience. i chose the three course menu risotto, seared scallops and louisiana butter cake , all delicious in their own way. might i add, the cheese plate was amazing, you are able to choose four cheeses from about different types. my guest and i were very satisfied and would absolutely return for another dining experience."
276,Christina S.,1120,5,11/22/15,"what can i say about gary danko that has not been said before i've started to write this review a million times and i have recommended gary danko to friends in text messages longer than any yelp review ever would be. and while i could fill pages with how wonderful the service, atmosphere, and drinks are, i think i will just stick with my favorites from the food. seared foie gras if you are into foie gras, you cannot go wrong with this. you are given way more foie gras then you would get anywhere else. seared sea scallops these may be the best scallops i've ever had. yes, you only get a few, but you will savor every last bite with your eyes closed. lemon pepper duck breast you get a large portion of duck, and it is served with this incredible duck hash as well. for true duck lovers, this is a must have. herb crusted loin of lamb this is a ridiculous, decadent dream. the lamb is so tender and flavorful. warm louisiana butter cake this is my favorite cake that i've ever had, period. it is all crust and warm butter and i would eat this every single day of my life if i would not become enormous. i would celebrate anything at gary danko. i would celebrate the sun rising and setting every day at gary danko. i'm already plotting my next visit."
277,Ghizal A.,1120,5,10/26/15,"gary danko is an experience, and that is why you should go here. be prepared to spend a pretty penny though. it is a great #treatyoself restaurant, so we celebrated an anniversary here. reservations were made about five weeks in advance for a saturday night. we each opted for the four course meal. together we had the following dishes seared ahi tuna pan seared bass horseradish salmon lamb seared filet of beef cheese plate creme brulee warm louisiana buttercake they were all delicious. the winners were by far the salmon, the lamb, and the buttercake for dessert. everything was good, but these three were outstanding. if i were to visit again i would probably scrap the cheese. it was not bad, but i would opt for an appetizer instead. on top of that because it was an anniversary celebration, they brought out an additional dessert and tray of cookies. everything was so very good! initially with the small portion size i was worried we would not be full, but by the end of it, were were overly stuffed. they sent us home with pumpkin cheesecake for breakfast. the only critique i have is the awkwardness of everybody celebrating something and getting the same dessert. seemed a bit impersonal and staged, particularly if you are the third group in your section to get the congratulations and here you go. not complaining about the free dessert though d."

279,Carina R.,1120,4,9/3/15,"gary danko. this place has been on my list of places to eat at for forever. so, on my birthday, we had no plans, and i decided that it was time to make reservations. i did call about months before my birthday for reservations and at the time, they had only two spots available or . it is! when we arrived, we were immediately seated at a little table for two that was small, but a good size for me and my hubby. the restaurant is dimly lit which leads to a more quiet, somewhat romantic, and very calm atmosphere. it was really quite lovely. the waiter told us a little about the menu and took our drink order. the wait staff there are all very professional and courteous. definitely a plus for a nice restaurant such as this. my husband and i decided to do courses. for my appetizer, i did the dungeness crab and melon salad. my husband had the corn soup with biscuit. the salad was delicious. the crab tasted fresh and was complimented so well by the melon. my husband's soup was definitely very good. i tried some and it was light but flavorful, and the biscuit floating in the soup soaking up the flavors was perfect to bite into while eating the soup. next was our fish plate. i had the sea scallops and my husband had the soft she will crab. both were, also, very good. however, the sea scallops are literally two scallops with some sauce. while the soft she will crab is a full soft she will crab, with pureed potatoes, and an assortment of vegetables. so, the soft she will crab is more bang for your buck. i love scallops, but that soft she will crab was a better plate in my opinion. then, came our meat plate. i had the pork tenderloin with braised cheek, and my husband had the lamb. we both agreed that our entrees were decent, but not amazing. after our appetizer and fish plate, we were enthusiastically awaiting our entrees. and instead of our overall meal being elevated, it just plateaued, which was a disappointment. do not misunderstand, the meal was good, but the flavors were not as awesome as our first two plates. for my husband's fourth course, he chose the cheese platter. we chose four cheeses a gruyere, a brie, and two goat cheeses that names escape me right now. some of the cheeses were rich and creamy, some were hard and crumbly, but all were full of flavor and wonderful. we enjoyed choosing our cheeses as well as eating them! my last course was dessert and i chose the warm louisiana butter bread with peaches and vanilla ice cream. very good. the only thing about dessert is that after dessert they bring you some small dessert bites, that you possibly do not have any room for, but somehow end up sampling anyways! so, my suggestion would be to go for a lighter dessert, so you can enjoy the small bites, as well. and of course, they sent us home with some pineapple cream cheese cake which we ate the next day with our kid and she loved it! . overall, stars. could have been stars, but the entrees did not quite meet our expectations."
280,Gail J.,1120,5,10/13/13,"we surprised my motherinlaw by celebrating her birthday gary danko's last night. she has very high standards, but our waiter wowed her just seconds after she opened her menu. the light level was too low for her to read, so presto! he whipped out a lighted magnifier. highlights of our dinner were the pan roasted quail stuffed with cornbread and pancetta, the seared sea scallops, and the pork tenderloin. the preparation was meticulous, but on the salty side for our tastes. in retrospect, i think that if we had mentioned to our attentive waiters that we preferred lower sodium in our meals, that request would have been honored. our strawberry souffle and louisiana butter cake were outstanding! for mom there was a special birthday dessert which pleased her tremendously. her smile as we left with our little packages of pumpkin cream cheese bread told me we made the right choice for her birthday dinner."
281,Katie L.,1117,4,10/22/18,"this place is always busy and take out takes forever. but their food is so good that i still come back. their chicken wings is a must get. we also ordered the hot and sour soup, shrimp and leek dumplings , beef fried rice, sauteed string beans and the black bean noodles. there was only of eating and had plenty of leftovers but it was just as good the next day for lunch!"
282,Mike M.,1117,5,10/18/18,"best chinese food in norcal, maybe anywhere. the home made kim chee is the best, then have shrimp and leek dumplings , pork dumplings , or pot stickers. you have never had better. they are home made fillings and noodles. be careful, you have them once and you will have to have them at least once a week! every dish is so flavorful and distinctly different. the yellow curries are awesome. kung pao is amazing. try the black bean homemade noodles or any noodles. chicken wings, garlic chicken, mao pao, dry fried string beans, mu shu, and everything is so special. very crowded for obvious reasons. sometimes the line is down the street. dress warm and bring a beverage to drink while waiting for a table on a friday or saturday night. you will never eat chinese food in san francisco anywhere else again. it is that good!!!! try san tung next door also. that is how good this food is, that they are able to have a second one next door. are you getting it! thank you to the chu family for making eating a heavenly experience! did i mention the sauces are the best in the world! mike mcnair"
283,Marie L.,1117,5,9/22/18,"i've been meaning to come here because all my sf friends recommend it all the time, so when i got the chance to go during a work trip to norcal, i had to do it. totally worth the hype food was amazing, holeinthewall authentic chinese restaurant! the two locations are right next to each other but my friends and i went to the og location. parking is difficult, but that is expected in the area. line was long which was also expected for dinner at pm on a monday night. we waited about mins for a group of . there were different kinds of people dining there from big families to couples, the food was enjoyed by people of all backgrounds. we ordered chicken wings sooooo amazing sweet, spicy, tangy goodness shrimp and leek dumplings house wonton soup sauteed string beans really tasty! black bean sauce noodles everything was amazing and i could tell all those dishes were favorites because every table pretty much had the same dishes as mentioned above overall, i'm so glad i finally got to try this place, and will try to come again soon"
284,Randy P.,1117,3,9/9/18,"first of all, lemme state that i do not live in the inner sunset neighborhood with convenience of arrival. it is a mile round trip. so my expectations were high. expectations were further amplified by pbs's check please recommendation as well as another foodie buddy. i must say i liked the caramelized sweetspicy sauce plus the nice surface crunch of their famous dry fried chicken wings. the meat inside though can be a bit tough, compared to the sublime powdered honey butter korean fried chicken at vons in the south bay. overall, the taste of sweetness dominates. and if you also order their dry black bean sauce noodle with seafood, the sweetness of these dishes combined become sorta overwhelming. dry fried chicken sauteed string beans shrimp and leek dumplings . stars dry black bean noodles "
285,Josephine Q.,1117,5,8/26/18,"this was my first time at this restaurant and even on a sunday night for a party of , the wait was almost hrs. i had high expectations for this place so when i visited sf, i knew i had to try it at least once since i was not able to on my prior trip but that was because it was with family and it is rare that the older generation would want to wait this long for food . anyway, i got the shrimp and leek dumplings and it tasted like i could have bought that from the supermarket and made it myself. i also got the black bean sauce noodles which was interesting because i never had it before. then. it was time for the original dry fried chicken wings and wow. those hrs were worth it and my expectations were met! when i come back to visit sf at a future date, i will be sure to return. there will not be any judgment if i only order the dry fried chicken wings, right "
286,Deborah P.,1117,5,8/19/18,"delicious. worth it. must try! my gosh, this place hands down has the best chinese food ever. i thought korea's chinese food was hella good but dang, san tung definitely raises the bar. going in i had high expectations because my brother would not stop raving about this place and let me tell you, this restaurant did not disappoint. black bean noodle noodles were perfectly cooked, sauce was so flavorful and i loved how there was no pork! chicken wings wow so amazing lol puts all the other wing places to shame. so sweet and savory with a good amount of meat on each piece of wing. i am going to crave these for sure. shrimp and leek dumplings so simple, yet so good! only thing is i wish they had put more shrimp inside. please open a restaurant in socal!! i will be your # customer lol"
287,Katherine N.,1117,4,7/9/18,"san tung was extremely popular when i lived here about years ago and i am happy to report it is still as popular as ever. i came about mins before closing and i was afraid i would be at the tail end of service. little did i know, there is still a line! they are so packed all the time. the original dry fried chicken wings are as amazing as what everyone else has said. crunchy yet so much sauce and flavor. every bite is heavenly. i also ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings . i was a little disappointed in it to be honest. i almost thought they gave me the wrong order because i did not see any shrimp ! there was probably leek shrimp ratio. the dumplings were not terrible, just not what i had wanted."
288,Nette T.,1117,4,7/4/18,"i cannot believe i have not written a review of san tung in all my years on yelp! i went here when i was at university.that is how long this place has been around. they are still packed to the gills with people and the wait is still long. my neighbor and i came here on a saturday night and when the uber driver dropped us off she asked it is the restaurant with people waiting on the sidewalk, right !!! you put your name on the whiteboard and make sure you stand near the door because the guy calling out the names can have fatigue so you barely hear your name being called. we finally got seated after a minute wait. their menu is extensive but all you need to remember from all the people raving on yelp is the dry fry chicken wet . we ordered dry fry chicken wet diced this came with a spicy and sweet sauce that was a nice contrast to the perfectly fried chicken. crunchy, spicy and sweet and oh so good. shrimp and leek dumpling little dumplings with ginger, garlic, ground shrimp and chinese chives love these boiled dumplings ! i felt healthy for eating these after the fried chicken. so flavorful and soft and even better when dipped in white vinegar. black bean sauce noodles sliced beef, shrimp and calamari in a dark soybean sauce served over a bowl of fresh homemade noodles this came with sliced cucumbers on top and was nice with the savory and chewy noodles. it is a lot of carbs so we did not eat as much as we wanted. service was efficient and my neighbor enjoyed our dinner here. i'm glad that i'm going back to my old stomping grounds from university and find that they are just as good now as they were back then."
289,Jasmine B.,1117,5,6/11/18,"i've been dining at san tung probably a decade. the dry fried chicken wings are a dream come true. worth writing your name on the dry erase board and waiting in the wind. i also enjoy the green beans and shrimp and leek dumplings . service is efficient and quick. prices are reasonable. highly recommend if you like chicken wings, so good!"
290,Hana L.,1117,5,6/8/18,so freaking good. get the dry fried chicken pieces and the green beans! do not waste any money or space in your stomach on anything else the shrimp and leek dumplings were a waste imo . there will be a line but seriously if you are in sf this is a must so go and thank me later.
291,Shannon H.,1117,4,3/5/18,"yummy yummy fried chicken magic. . do not miss out on the fried chicken. . the potstickers are also super bomb. . absolutely do not miss out on the fried chicken wet or dry but the sauce they put on it is really magic. so this place gets ridiculously crowded for dinner time i've driven past the crowds on the way home but at lunch actually it was not too bad. there was about a min wait while they cleared out a table for our party of two. the place is fairly spacious with lots of room for big parties but they also have some four tops for those that are traveling lighter. we ordered the fried chicken, potstickers on the recommendation of a coworker and fellow yelpers , honey walnut shrimp , and the shrimp and leek dumplings . all really tasty. the honey walnut shrimp is probably pretty standard and i've had better dumplings at other places but these were still pretty good. i would recommend the fried chicken did i say that enough yet and the potstickers if you are at a loss. they have lunch specials and the lunch special fried chicken was pcs as opposed to . they are served wet or dry and i thought we ordered ours dry but they came with a sauce on it. which i would think would be the wet ones either way they were still super good. parking sucks here. it is irving and no matter when you go, it will be pretty tough. meters and some free street parking on the side streets if you are extra lucky."
292,Cui Cui Z.,1117,3,2/11/18,"wanted to check out the hype here. ordered what seemed to be the most popular items dry fried chicken wings, shrimp and leek dumplings , and black bean sauce noodles. we ordered everything to go, minutes for a to go order so make sure you call ahead. we had to try calling several times as the first two times the answering machine picked up. the dry fried chicken wings were good, tasted like the korean wings. the shrimp and leek dumplings were tasty even without any dipping sauce. the black bean sauce noodles were okay, a little bland. all in all, decent place. would not go out of my way to eat here but if your in the area, it is worth a try."
293,Steph L.,1117,4,2/10/18,"san tung is my go to place for chicken wings! i went yesterday on a friday night for dinner and the wait was surprisingly short. at around pm, there were only people in front of me on the list. this translated to only a minute wait. oftentimes when i would pass by the restaurant, i would notice a crowd so large that it would have had to be at least an hour wait. i've been coming here for the last years with my family before san tung became very well known to the bay area community. still to this day, i order the same things chicken wings, string beans, shrimp and leek dumplings , deluxe noodle. although everything about my meal was delicious, i noticed compared to before, portions are smaller and everything is a lot sweeter especially the string beans and chicken wings. the string beans and the chicken wings used to actually have a mild spiciness level, but you do not get that anymore."
294,Tori G.,1117,4,1/27/18,"i'm not sure if it was because i gave into the massive amount of hype san tungs had, but after finishing my meal i was a bit disappointed in the quality and taste of food they offered at dinner. despite there being people ahead of us when we arrived, the wait went by very fast which was a plus. but take note you only get one chance to be seated once if your name gets called off the wait list, they do not mess around with seating you quickly. so if you do not hear your name called, you are out of luck. we ordered their famous chicken, but we asked for it diced instead of on the bone disappointing. to me the chicken tasted like a less syrupy version of panda express orange chicken , we also ordered a peanut sauce noodle which was amazing, the sauce was rich and well seasoned and the noodles were perfectly cooked in my opinion , we also ordered their green beans which was also decent. it was not as seasoned or oily as other chinese green beans i've eaten, which was a good thing we also got shrimp and leek dumplings the cooks forgot about our dumplings and we did not receive them until after they gave us our bill to leave we had to remind them we ordered it and when we finally did get them, they were tough, over done, and i feel they had too much leek which over powered the rest of the flavor of the dumplings overall san tungs was an okay dining experience. i would not go out of my way to eat here again."
295,Sarah C.,1117,4,1/21/18,"i do not really like chinese food, which makes this harder. it is a real struggle between three and four. all around they are very much as one would expect a chinese restaurant to be nothing special, but solid american style chinese food except those chicken wings are above par. their dry fried chicken wings are quite good. very nicely fried, and the sauces is pretty tasty although i could have gone spicier maybe if i were not white they would have made them spicier who knows. the other things eh. tasted like chinese food. we got the green beans another chinese dish i can sometimes handle and they were ok but i've definitely had better. we also got fried rice which was fine but did not stand out in anyway. last we got shrimp and leek dumplings , which i did not try, but my husband stays they were standard. they do get busy but they also seat people at their large family tables that do not know each other so that helps."

297,Ann N.,1117,2,11/5/17,"my friend and i arrived at san tung on july about minutes before it opened. we opted to pay for meter parking since parking is scarce in sf. waiting in line in the cold, i was stoked to ry the famous wings and a few other recommended dishes thanks fellow yelpers. right at am, the doors opened and a full house was seated within minutes. protip come within that first wave of customers to avoid the wait. we ordered the following dishes based on popular reviews dry fried chicken these were supposed to be one of the best wings i will have in my life. i thought they were just slightly above average. maybe the hype was overbuilt for these wings some friends will load a carryon bag with wings to bring back to socal for friends as a souvenir gift from their travels mins north in a plane lol i thought they were just standard wings dressed in an asian sauce. what is so special about that t least the wings were not dry i suppose. shrimp and leek dumplings these came out cold in the middle as if they froze them and did not defrost the dumplings before cooking them. not a fan but props to them for not making the dumpling she will to doughy. black bean paste noodles drenched in black bean paste, i was not sure what i was eating aside from the sauce. wow i must be one of few who have such a bad experience there. i was so disappointed in the quality of the food but i will definitely give this place another try."
298,Samantha D.,1117,5,10/29/17,"excellent food! everything we ordered was great, i want to order each item on the menu. of course, the original fried chicken was crispy with the best sweet and tangy sauce. the shrimp and leek dumpling were very fresh tasting. the pork chow mein was also worth noting. very large portions at a reasonable price!"
299,Merica S.,1117,4,10/25/17,"i'm more of a buffalo wild wings kinda gal, but i have to admit that the original dry fried chicken wings from here have me feelin' some type of way. these wings are the numero uno reason to visit. if you are visiting to try other menu items from here, then get the f ck out. just kiddingother somewhat noteworthy things to order include the shrimp and leek dumplings and the dried sauteed green beans. no frills good food. anyway, back to the wings. they come out piping hot, savory n' sweet, and crispy. get ready for some major finger lickin' action. yum."
300,Diana T.,1117,2,9/18/17,"oh, san tung. i'm sad that this place was over hyped and underwhelming. we came around dinnertime, and luckily there was not a wait. we ordered the famous dry fried chicken, along with the black bean sauce noodles and shrimp and leek dumplings . the black bean sauce noodles were served with slices of beef, shrimp and calamari, and lacked some flavor. i felt like i was eating just flour with the dumplings . last, the dry fried chicken. sure, it was crispy and sticky and gooey, but lacked major flavor. compared to bonchon wings, the flavor here is lacking. but to each their own."
301,Lena H.,1117,4,9/24/18,the four star review is really just for the original dry fried chicken wings since this is the most popular menu item here and you can see that every table got or orders. the restaurant is packed during lunch and dinner hours so there is always a wait time so i usually order foods togo. i do not find other entrees exceptional besides the dry fried wings . some entrees are very good and some are just average dishes so really depends on what i ordered here. i wish the quality could be more consistent across the menu. expect wait time if you come here.
302,Julia S.,1117,5,9/14/18,"after reading the reviews, i was expecting a very long wait for lunch. however, when i got there around pm on a friday, i only had to wait a couple minutes before i was seated! the whole restaurant was packed, but the workers were very efficient in cleaning tables and seating the next people on the waitlist. my table got the original dry fried chicken wings , black bean sauce noodles, and potstickers. we came in very hungry, but only ended up finishing the chicken wings and a few potstickers. i personally did not think the noodles and potstickers were anything special, but the fried chicken is something else. i had heard great things about it, and it did not disappoint! i loved the flavor of the sightly spicy coating, and the crunchiness of the skin with the tenderness inside. i would definitely come by again to order more of those!"
303,Celine L.,1117,4,9/3/18," , + reviews & . stars for fried chicken put this place on the map for my boyfriend and me. upon arriving we saw a large crowd of people waiting outside so my boyfriend dropped me off in front while he went to look for parking. your whole party needs to be here in order to be seated . the whiteboard to write your name is to your right as soon as you enter. put your name down and wait. the place is relatively small, so not much space but i did notice a small separate dining room for a larger party. it was not that long before we were seated maybe minutes i'm pretty patient so wait times do not bother me too much. we ordered orders of the original dry fried chicken not sure why it is called dry because they are the exact opposite. chicken is moist and covered in sauce. the sauce is sweet, tangy, and salty. it has some red pepper flakes in it. reminded me of panda express's orange chicken but better. plus they use drummettes & wings . this is what they are known for and my boyfriend and i were fans! soo good. szechuan roasted duck & buns one of my fave chinese wedding dishes which i had to introduce to my mexican boyfriend. he fell in love! he cleaned the bones and basically ate whole thing by himself. i personally think i've had better but i'm just glad he liked it. the dry black bean noodles were alright. definitely nothing out of this world. the texture of the mushy noodles kind of grossed me out. overall i give this place . stars rounding to . the chicken alone made up for the lack of customer service. the servers were disgruntled and some of the plates and tea cups were dirty. overall i had a great time and we took home leftovers."
304,Josephine Q.,1117,5,8/26/18,"this was my first time at this restaurant and even on a sunday night for a party of , the wait was almost hrs. i had high expectations for this place so when i visited sf, i knew i had to try it at least once since i was not able to on my prior trip but that was because it was with family and it is rare that the older generation would want to wait this long for food . anyway, i got the shrimp and leek dumplings and it tasted like i could have bought that from the supermarket and made it myself. i also got the black bean sauce noodles which was interesting because i never had it before. then. it was time for the original dry fried chicken wings and wow. those hrs were worth it and my expectations were met! when i come back to visit sf at a future date, i will be sure to return. there will not be any judgment if i only order the dry fried chicken wings , right "
305,Priscilla P.,1117,4,8/19/18,"i've been to san tung a few times and taken it togo countless of other times. the wait is usually pretty long for the weekend. i would say anywhere between an hour to two. if you go about min prior to when they open for dinner you will be able to be seated right away. i saw a large group walk in at opening saying they had reservations but i'm guessing they only take reservations for large parties. recently we ordered the original dry fried chicken , the pork and leek dumplings, the hot and sour soup, the garlic green beans, and the black bean sauce noodles. the original dry fried chicken is great because it has a bit of spice yet a bit of sweetness to it. i would not call it dry exactly though since there is sauce but it is more of a sticky sauce rather than something like buffalo wings . the pork and leek dumplings were not so impressive to me since i felt they were bland and super salty on the inside. i enjoyed the black bean sauce noodles and the garlic green beans. though i did like the hot and sour soup i did notice it tasted very spicy due to a peppery taste it was as if they used a lot of the grey pepper you see in asian restaurants so if you are not into that and a kick of spice then this dish might not be for your. portions are fair for the cost. service can be so so as you would have to wave down the waiters from time to time and maybe multiple times before they catch your attention. i would come back but if the wait is too long i would rather usually just take it to go or door dash it."
306,James B.,1117,4,8/8/18,"i finally got to try this place after a couple of failed attempts. i came here twice before but they were closed. when i arrived, there was about an hour long wait and i was not about to wait that long, so i just ordered for take out. black bean noodles actually tasted like the korean chinese version. of all the places that i've tried in la, it was probably the best that i've tried so far. original dry chicken wings had a good balance of savory and sweet so it was pretty dang delicious. i can see why everyone who comes here orders this. i do not know why it says dry because it is not dry . it is a bit saucy."
307,Vinia N.,1117,4,7/24/18,"their food is good, but not the price. my favorite is their original dry fried chicken wings , it has a sweet but salty taste. the dumplings and noodles are also good choices. the one thing that is not the best are the price points. one order of twelve to thirteen wings is . the price point is pricey for the small amount of wings . the wings are also fairly smaller than regular wings ."
308,Katherine N.,1117,4,7/9/18,"san tung was extremely popular when i lived here about years ago and i am happy to report it is still as popular as ever. i came about mins before closing and i was afraid i would be at the tail end of service. little did i know, there is still a line! they are so packed all the time. the original dry fried chicken wings are as amazing as what everyone else has said. crunchy yet so much sauce and flavor. every bite is heavenly. i also ordered the shrimp and leek dumplings. i was a little disappointed in it to be honest. i almost thought they gave me the wrong order because i did not see any shrimp! there was probably leek shrimp ratio. the dumplings were not terrible, just not what i had wanted."
309,Andrea S.,1117,5,6/28/18,"the honey glazed original dry fried chicken wings are what everyone gets here! be sure to get here early as there always is a long waiting list. other than the chicken , get the black bean noodles and dumplings or some veggies to complement your wings !"
310,Luke L.,1117,4,6/25/18,"you know why you are here yup you are here for those legendary chicken wings . the name san tung translates to the word shan dong a province in china and the province is best known for its dumplings. since the province is just one yellow sea away from korea, san tung's menu also have several korean influenced dishes. our group got here minutes before the opening time and the restaurant opened minutes early pm . initially the restaurant was % filled up, but by the time we walked out at pm the restaurant was completely packed. food did take a while to come out + minutes , but service was actually pretty good comparing with other chinese restaurants english friendly menu & waiters spoke good english . five spice beef noodle # sliced five spice beef and tendon in a bowl of fresh homemade soup noodles accompanied with spinach, this was the first beef noodle soup i had with broth that contains pieces of ginger, but broth had an interesting aroma and tasted slightly spicy. beef and tendon had star worthy meltinyourmouth texture. noodle was pretty mediocre. it was a good beef noodle soup, but i had better one in southern california e.g. sinbala restaurant & corner beef noodle house . original dry fried chicken # chicken wings deep fried in butter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers pieces of wings for . this is san tung's # signature item. each wing was covered in addicting sweet and sour sauce with slightly spicy kick. chicken quality was pretty good too not too dry and pretty meaty. if you are a fan of kfc not colonel sanders i mean korean fried chicken , then you will appreciate san tung's fried chicken because these wings also had similar sweet & spicy flavor profiles. overall a solid . star on food. p.s. san tung has a sister restaurant right next door san tung , but the sister restaurant does not sell potstickers and dumplings."
311,Mikayla M.,1117,3,6/24/18,"whenever i pass by this restaurant, there is always a line. i've also heard about their chicken wings that are beyond amazing so finally got to try this place. overall, i enjoyed the food but it did not meet the expectation that i had walking in from what others were mentioning. ordered original dry fried chicken , pork dumplings, and beef fried rice."
312,Yennhu N.,1117,5,5/29/18,"i first heard of san tung through social media, years ago. everyone would post pictures of their chicken wings and green beans with high praise. but i never really had the desire to try it, because its just asian food. but one day, i happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. and since then, i've been making san tung a regular stop whenever i'm in sf, and introducing it to all my friends. my first time here, i came on a saturday night, during prime time. it was about a minute wait for people. once seated, we ordered the original dry fried chicken , dried sauteed string beans, combination chow mein and potstickers with a bowl of rice. the dry fried chicken was hands down, the best asian fried chicken i've ever had. the wings were cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. each order comes with about wings . the sauce goes great on top of white rice too! the string beans were really good too. it complimented the chicken . the chow mein was a it too oily, but still delicious. the potstickers were massive. i recommend sharing the plate of with people. my top two favorite things were the wings and green beans, definitely a must try. the customer service here was okay. they are very busy so sometimes its hard to get the server's attention. the atmosphere of the restaurant itself resembles any other chinese family restaurant. the parking situation here is very bad though. located in a very popular area, its hard to come across street parking. i had to circle around for minutes before finding something. overall, i highly recommend giving this place a try. its a good place to go with a bigger group of people, that way, you can do family style meal. pro tip there is a san tung right next door, put your name on both and see which one gets called first. from my experience, san tung has a shorter wait time. but there are a few items, like dumplings, that are not served here."
313,Ly L.,1117,3,3/25/18,"ordered the black bean sauce noodle # , dried sauteed string beans # , pork dumplings # and original dry fried chicken # . the wait for a table was about mins for table of . reasons why i rated a three stars is customer service was not that great and food was not that great. the black bean sauce noodle has shrimp, beef, and calamari over black bean sauce in a noodle. the sauce could be better. was not too impressed by it. kind of plain to me. the pork dumpling would have been better if there was a good special sauce to dip in. i would recommend the dry fried chicken . this is something i would definitely come back for. it is extra hot when it comes out so be careful eating it. the sauce for this chicken is amazing! i would eat it with rice in the future lastly, the dried sauteed string beans. it is pretty typical to get at any chinese restaurant. i still enjoyed it. overall, i give a three stars because i was not impressed with the popular orders. i probably would not come back to eat."
314,Ling P.,1117,4,3/18/18,"my friend & i visited sf for a minigetaway & san tung made it on our long list of food places to try! we ordered the sauteed string beans, black bean sauce noodles, & of course, the original dry fried chicken wings . the sauteed string beans were crispy and delicious. it was sauteed in this flavorful garlic sauce. definitely a musttry. the black bean sauce noodles was a cross between the chinese and korean version. it was tasty, but it was my least favorite of the that my friend & i ordered. instead of just beef pork, they added shrimp and calamari, which was weird to me. i'm not a fan of seafood in my jajjangmyun zhajiangmian. now, let us get down to the chicken you all. let me tell ya, it was probably one of the best chicken wings i've ever had. it had a savory sweet taste. these wings definitely made it to my overall top favorites that i had to buy a box to bring home to bae. trying to win bgfoty best gf of the year award nom sayin' xd the service was not so great as expected at these type of asian restaurants. it was hard to get water refills and we always had to flag someone down. overall, a great experience in regards to the food, which makes up for the slow service."
315,Lissette T.,1117,4,3/8/18,"i love this place! for the food.not the wait! original dry fried chicken wings , chow mein, wonton soup, i love everything i've ordered."
316,Stephanie T.,1117,5,1/24/18,"came here and ordered the original dry fried chicken and black bean sauce noodles and they were both delicious. the original dry fried chicken wings were definitely the highlight of the meal! they were garlicky, gingery, sweet, sour, and had a mild spicy kick. the exterior of the wing was perfectly cooked and the coating was almost like a sticky glaze while the chicken inside was juicy and tender. each bite was full of flavor and i never got tired of it. the dish came with wings so it was a perfect amount to share. the black bean sauce noodles were also good, i'm allergic to shellfish so they were nice enough to separate the shrimp and calamari on the side my friend enjoyed it with her portion . the noodles were chewy, fresh, and the flavor of the black bean sauce was not too overpowering or salty. be prepared for a wait but it is definitely worth it to try!"
317,Rachel C.,1117,5,1/4/18,"second time here and i cannot not order their original dry fried chicken ! it is hands down the best tasting chicken at a chinese restaurant. possibly in sf, too. as soon as we were seated we already knew we wanted two orders of their chicken and rice! each plate came with pieces so order two plates 'cos you are going to want more. well, especially if you are with a group of hungry friends. the sauce has a little kick to it but is also on the sweeter side. be prepared for sticky fingers, too! but trust, the mess is worth every bite. note it can get really packed so expect a wait. but! there is a san tung right next door to the original spot and there really is not any difference between the two. so avoid the possible wait and just dine inside san tung ! also, if you are craving boba or ice cream afterwards, t pumps is a few blocks down ~ min walk . sf home creamery is also a few blocks up the hill from san tung."
318,Sally W.,1117,4,1/4/18,"came right when they opened so there was no wait. but the restaurant filled up in mins. we ordered the seaweed soup was decent tasted like instant noodle based soup. string green beans were delicious, nicely cooked and healthy. original fried chicken dry , made me fall in love, it was more sweet than salty pork chow mien was okay, nothing special to it. the fried chicken is what you should come here for! love, canadian tourist"
319,Mary D.,1117,5,12/10/17,"best fried chicken i've had, hands down! if you are in the san francisco area, you have got to stop by here. my friend and i went here for a weekend trip to visit our other friend, who took us on an adventure full of food and fun lol. originally , this place was on our agenda for lunch on sat, but we had had brunch beforehand and it would have been too much. we ended up coming there for dinner and made sure we were early so we could get their famous original dry fried chicken wings . we found parking luckily before the street got packed, and got in line at pm. the line got really long quickly, and they decided to open early, letting us in at pm. within minutes, it was a full house!! it only took about minutes for our to go order, and the three of us had pieces each. their chicken is one of the best, comparable to korean fried chicken but a little better. they are a little sweet but nonetheless top notch! not sure why the chicken is coined dry fried chicken as it is not dry at all. the outside of the fried chicken was crispy and crunchy, with a mound of sweet thick sauce on the bottom. not sure how the chicken managed to stay crunchy with all the sauce, but it did. it did not matter either because it did not take us long to devour the box. gone in seconds! maybe a little more. the only thing i would do is add more sesame seeds to it. the chicken was so good we ended up coming back for a second order after we had dinner at another restaurant. this time around, we also tried their black bean noodles make sure you ask for black bean noodles and not the wet black bean noodles, as there are items on the menu which were delicious as well. you get a huge order for , and it is mostly noodles drenched in black bean sauce, with small bits of mixed seafood. this place was so good we came back the next day with another friend from out of town! the four of us had more dozen. so dozen original dry fried chicken wings in two days!! i'm not much of a meat eater. so it goes to show how good this place is if we can consume that many chicken wings in a short time lol. i will definitely drop by here the next time i am in the area. quick service and tasty food! happy eating!"
320,Kimberly L.,1117,5,12/8/17,"i went here with my friends over the weekend when i was in the sf. we got there before pm and there was a line formed in front of the restaurant. they let everyone in even before pm hit. we ordered the original dry fried chicken for the first time first round lol. it was very good and flavorful. the fried chicken was crispy hot and juicy smothered in some sweet and spicy delicious sauce. we saw other trying their black bean noodle. after a couple hours, we came back and we waited for an half hour or so due to the crowded. we got seated with a group of guys since there was limited tables here. we wanted to try to other dishes there so we ordered the black bean noodle. we waited for an half hour or so due to the crowded and we got seated with a group of guys since there was limited tables here. the noodle was smothered with black bean sauces, meats, and seafood. it was quite tasty and good. our servers and services was very fast and attentive every time we were here. so we end up here times over the weekend since one of my friend did not get to go the other day lol. we ordered to dozens of fried chicken wings and that how you know this place is good lol. this place maybe be hard to find parking since it all street parking best to find parking near by residents or elsewhere and walk over. i definitely be back in the future to get more fried chicken from here."
321,George S.,1117,5,10/17/18,"who knew fried chicken wings were such a delicacy found san tung on yelp and was amazed at the number of reviews. this seemed like an anomaly. since there were so many reviews we decided to come early and beat the dinner rush. so we thought! we pulled up and the sidewalk was already crowded with people waiting. what does that tell you we put our names on the list and it was about an hour wait. if you have the time, it is well worth the wait. once we were seated, we noticed that almost every table in the restaurant had orders of the chicken wings, and some tables have multiple plates of them. besides ordering the chicken wings, we also had pork dumplings , black bean sauce noodles and mongolian beef. everything we ordered was delicious but the dry chicken wings were handsdown our favorite. next time i would get a few orders of them. also multiple tables had orders of the green beans, so will have to try those as well as they were a popular menu item. too bad we do not live closer to san tung. next time we are in san francisco this is a must stop destination for us."
322,Juan R.,1117,5,9/24/18,"was told this place had great chicken wings, man they were awesome. we arrived at pm , no lines so went for a quick walk. returned at to find a long line. we ordered the fried rice, pork dumplings and an order of regular chicken wings. highly recommend!"
323,Brandon G.,1117,4,9/24/18,"if you want a solid meal for very cheap, look no further. i usually get the typical order of chicken wings, pork dumplings , string beans, black bean noodles. never disappoints! i hear they have another location somewhere in the city by a different name. would love to try that one day as well. b"
324,Emily C.,1117,5,9/23/18," stars for the food the pork dumplings are steamy and comforting and taste great with vingear, the dry fried chicken wings are their most popular dish and a mustorder. i personally enjoy eating the wings with their black bean noodles, and i know a lot of other people enjoy their green beans even though they are on the sweeter side for me. overall a place i love to come to for comfort food, even though the wait is usually very long."
325,Rose N.,1117,4,7/26/18,"i finally tried this place after hearing so much about it for the past few years! my friends and i drove one hour from sj to sf just for their food. it is a typical chinese establishment and the store itself is pretty small. we got there around pm they reopen for dinner at and there was already a huge wait! we put our names party of down and were seated after an hour. i noticed that they have a san tung right next door and was told they open it up when the main store gets too crowded. even though it was really busy when i went, the second store was still closed. it would have been really nice if they opened it to help out with the crowd though. we ordered the string beans, pork dumplings , black bean noodles, and san tung's infamous chicken wings. even though we waited a long time to get seated, the food came out really quickly! the other dishes were pretty standard, nothing too special but the chicken was amazing. the chicken is so flavorful and crispythe hype is real! i would definitely be back just for their chicken!"
326,Amberly H.,1117,4,6/25/18,"came here after a long mile hike with my friends and boy did it hit the spot! we got here about minutes before they opened and there was already a line forming. if that does not tell you how good the food is i do not know what does. i've come here before for lunch as well and waited around minutes. minutes, minutes, whatever the wait may be, this place is worth it! we ordered plates of the fried chicken, one plate of pork dumplings , the string beans, and the black bean noodles. everyone comes here for the fried chicken, and for good reason! i am completely in love with the sweet salty, sticky sauce that the wings come drenched in. the wings are perfectly crispy and not soggy from the sauce at all! green beans were good. you can either drench them in the sauce they come in or dip them in the chicken wing sauce. otherwise, there is not too much flavor to them. dumplings were as good as dumplings can be. the noodles were probably my least favorite dish to the meal just because i felt that it lacked flavor and some salt. i was hoping it would satisfy my craving for zha jiang mian, but sadly it did not. since we were one of the first tables to order, our food came out really fast i would say within minutes. even when i came during a busier time before, the food would never take long to come out. i really enjoyed this because, on both occasions, i was starving so was glad to receive my food quickly. they do give you a fortune cookie at the end. however, it does not come in a plastic bag like most do, which makes me kind of skeptical about how clean it is. i do not know whether or not they used tongs or something to pick them up, or if they just used their hands to put it on the check holder. i wish they would have bought packaged cookies to serve to their guests just due to sanitation reasons. i will definitely be coming back to this place for the fried chicken time and time again. might try some different noodles though. will keep you updated!"
327,Mikayla M.,1117,3,6/24/18,"whenever i pass by this restaurant, there is always a line. i've also heard about their chicken wings that are beyond amazing so finally got to try this place. overall, i enjoyed the food but it did not meet the expectation that i had walking in from what others were mentioning. ordered original dry fried chicken, pork dumplings , and beef fried rice."
328,Stacy A.,1117,4,6/18/18,"yelp challenge must try place in sf! the wet & dry wings are both really delicious!!! they are filled with flavor and they are pretty filling too. we got the pork dumplings and i fell. in. love. soooo good, better than din tai fung!! cons usually a wait and super packed so come early! they also charged us for rice when we did not order or get any. but i confronted them about it and they took it off right away."
329,Marissa P.,1117,5,6/3/18,"wow, now i know why there is always a line for this place! i know i'm late to the hype, but i could never get here early enough to avoid the ridiculous wait or find parking. so, i was excited when my cousins decided to meet here early for lunch. we planned to get to the restaurant before they opened at am and we did it! that is pretty surprising since we all run on filipino time and we were coming from different areas ssf, san leandro and salinas monterey. parking was hell, but we were lucky enough to find parking in the nearby neighborhood. there was already a long line at am but we were able to get seated as soon as the doors opened. we ordered the popular dry chicken wings yaaaaasss, believe the hype! my friend had let me try her leftovers before and it was so good but having it fresh was just amazing! the crispy chicken tossed in garlic, ginger and chili flakes was worth every bite! garlic flavored eggplant dry fried beef pork dumplings dry sauteed stringbeans house fried rice all was delicious, but the star of the meal was the dry chicken wings! our bill was about for people and we had enough food plus some leftovers. you cannot beat that! there were no issues with the service and not a long wait for the food. will i be back heck yeah! already planning on it!"
330,Norman S.,1117,2,6/2/18,"sure, the wings are great. thousands of reviews have told you that. but everything else is pretty forgettable. the zhajiang noodles seem just ok. i'm sure you can find better options within a few blocks. the pork dumplings are bland. soy sauce, vinegar and ginger cannot save them. the string beans are fine. but let us be honest, it is hard to screw up string beans. there is nothing much else to say since everything except the chicken wings were not memorable. if you want their wings, just get takeout and save yourself from the awful, hourlong wait and mediocre service."
331,Ryan F.,1117,3,5/30/18,"i have a huge love hate relationship with san tungs. the food is definitely good and even has the traditional chinese vibe with a diverse crowd of locals and travelers eating here. unfortunately, that usually results in a long line that takes a while to get seated and often after being seated another minutes before a server noticed you. i should note though, san tungs is a fairly well oiled machine given how few staff they had on the floor. i would not last more than an hour doing the work they do where they rotate around between service, cleaning and hosting. i have a lot of respect for the work they do so this review takes that effort into account. as mentioned earlier, service is a little slow so it took roughly minutes after being seated to finally be able to order. once ordered, the food flowed out from the kitchen quite quickly. however, my group ordered a set of steamed potstickers and fried potstickers togo after deciding we were still hungry. our server told us the wait would be minutes but we agreed. once the potstickers arrived, it made the wait just a blip in our memory. despite not being highly sought after on yelp, i highly recommend the steamed potstickers. they had this slightly chewier texture in comparison to the dumplings we ordered. the skin of the dough was more elastic than the dumplings and held the heat of the filling better. truthfully, it was kind of bit similar to the pork dumplings as the filling was the same but the texture of the elastic potsticker skin really made the juicy filling shine better. besides the potstickers, their well known dry chicken was good as usual. it felt as the wings were a bit smaller this time around but all of that was forgotten upon the first bite. one thing that san tungs does so much better than other places for fried chicken is how they seal the moisture of the chicken within the wings while still having a crunchy skin exterior. after finally eating our fill, we asked for the check and paid. as i've said earlier in my review, this place was understaffed for the sheer volume of customers. well for my group, the server forgot our take out order despite ordering it alongside steamed potstickers. since it was already paid for, we looked like idiots waiting at the table after finishing eating. i would hope they can add more staff in the future so they are not overworked but it was not a great experience for a meal to be pulled back another minutes since they forgot to make the fried potstickers. ultimately, this place has great food but their service can improve mostly from having more staff on the floor. my review is mostly a reflection of the food and seeing how hard their staff was working but other patrons were visibly upset at missing orders and long periods between service. tl dr food was great as always but service was mediocre at best. i would also recommend a hidden gem, steamed potstickers over their dumplings ."
332,P. A.,1117,5,5/28/18,"there is something incredibly charming about a semi dumpy chinese restaurant in a nondescript part of town that draws a line before it even opens. got here minutes before the doors opened am on a holiday , and it filled up within five minutes of opening. there was a good ratio of tourists to locals. we got the chicken wings, pork dumplings , and green beans and enjoyed all three. the green beans were sweeter than other places. chicken wings were crispy, sweet, and not spicy although there is chili paste if you want to add a kick . other tables had noodles and bok choy. if you are in the area, the th st tiled steps are about min away uphill from the restaurant and worth checking out. especially the lower portion has a great succulent garden. take an extra flight of stairs to a great overlook of the city."
333,Amador A.,1117,5,5/22/18,"wow! on a saturday night at pm the wait was hours long. you know what.it was well worth it. first you have to write you name on the easier board and wait to be called. the guy that calls names, whispers names out to listen carefully. we did not sit with others and other reviewers mentioned. eats combo fried rice, simply delicious. chicken wings, also delicious. the menu stated the wings were spicy. however far from spicy and a more sweet. a def must! pork dumplings were also very good. living in ny give me many options for chinese food so i was hesitance trying chinese food anywhere else. i'm glad my friend recommended this restaurant to me. if i am ever in san francisco again i will be visiting san tung."
334,Alice H.,1117,4,4/29/18,"went there for their dry fried chicken wings. also ordered pork dumplings , beef with black mushrooms, and chicken fried rice. as usual food was good and service was quick. there was a line even before they opened at ."
335,Ly L.,1117,3,3/25/18,"ordered the black bean sauce noodle # , dried sauteed string beans # , pork dumplings # and original dry fried chicken # . the wait for a table was about mins for table of . reasons why i rated a three stars is customer service was not that great and food was not that great. the black bean sauce noodle has shrimp, beef, and calamari over black bean sauce in a noodle. the sauce could be better. was not too impressed by it. kind of plain to me. the pork dumpling would have been better if there was a good special sauce to dip in. i would recommend the dry fried chicken. this is something i would definitely come back for. it is extra hot when it comes out so be careful eating it. the sauce for this chicken is amazing! i would eat it with rice in the future lastly, the dried sauteed string beans. it is pretty typical to get at any chinese restaurant. i still enjoyed it. overall, i give a three stars because i was not impressed with the popular orders. i probably would not come back to eat."
336,Selina H.,1117,5,3/20/18,"wow this place definitely lives up to the hype!! came from la to try their dry fried chicken wings and i was not disappointed. we ordered the chicken wings, black bean noodles, sauteed dry string beans, potstickers, and steamed pork dumplings . the dishes that stood out to me the most were the chicken wings and the string beans. the sauce for the wings is super unique and it is so addicting. i also wish they had black vinegar, but they only had white vinegar so i did not really like the sauce i made for my dumplings . the line can be pretty long, but it actually goes by pretty fast so do not be intimidated. it is worth the wait! i really wish they had a location in la "
337,Amanda C.,1117,4,3/5/18,"surprised i never reviewed this spot, but i love coming here for their chicken wings! the sauce is so amazing, so make sure you order the string beans too because it is made with the same sauce. they may not have the best service here, but the wings are worth it! i also typically order their pork dumplings and the black bean noodles. even ordering the wings togo is worth it. they opened a second store next door since the lines for this was always crazy, however the first one always tastes better!"
338,Connie W.,1117,3,2/4/18,"why do i not agree with the popular vote i do not understand why their dry fried chicken is so popular. first of all, wings are not dry, but instead drenched with a sugar glaze. the sauce is so sweet it tasted like the americanized chinese dish called orange chicken. however, the crispy skin is the redeeming feature making it good enough. also ordered the black bean noodles, pork dumplings , seafood soup, and sauteed green bean. all these were upto par."
339,Kevin N.,1117,3,1/20/18,"i do not get it, maybe i'm blessed by living in southern california specifically the but i do not get the lines and the hype for san tung. do not me. lined up at pm before they opened with people in front of us already. minutes pass and rolls around and line grows by . doors open, everyone floods in, and they surprisingly have space to seat almost everyone that waited with us before . order for chicken wings pieces . x decent, spicy or no spicy, good sauce, very sticky, good but nothing mind blowing that justifies the insane lines. pork dumplings x decent nothing special vegetable dumplings x decent nothing special sauteed string beans . x standard overall sure go try it, make sure to get there before they open or suffer and wait in line. try their chicken wings because they are highly rated and then write a review and me if i'm wrong. standard meal, standard sf pricing, long waits."
340,Guest U.,1117,4,1/2/18,"been here on and off for years. even before yelp be came famous. as usual the line at pm was out the door. the service was as good as it can with a packed house. we ordered the dried fried chicken, green beans, and pork dumplings . all was good and flavorful. i personally liked the dumplings , but the rest of the group said the fried chicken was the best. i think it is a win win no matter what you order. that is if you get a seat. our party waited more than mins for a seat."
341,Sherry Y.,1117,3,10/17/18,"chicken wings were alright. definitely suggest to order it with the sauce but if you order it dry, you can ask for the sauce on the side. the chicken wings were nicely fried. if you plan on taking togo or in case of leftovers, order the sauce on the side. i would only order the chicken wings as the few noodle and dumplings potstickers were meh."
342,S K.,1117,5,9/27/18,"this is my absolute favorite chinese restaurant in the city and i'm born n raised. i love the dried fried garlic chicken wings potstickers noodles garlic green beans so yum! food is fresh and lines can be quite long but most def worth the wait! my whole family loves this place, and those who have not tried should go !!!!"
343,Julia S.,1117,5,9/14/18,"after reading the reviews, i was expecting a very long wait for lunch. however, when i got there around pm on a friday, i only had to wait a couple minutes before i was seated! the whole restaurant was packed, but the workers were very efficient in cleaning tables and seating the next people on the waitlist. my table got the original dry fried chicken wings, black bean sauce noodles, and potstickers . we came in very hungry, but only ended up finishing the chicken wings and a few potstickers . i personally did not think the noodles and potstickers were anything special, but the fried chicken is something else. i had heard great things about it, and it did not disappoint! i loved the flavor of the sightly spicy coating, and the crunchiness of the skin with the tenderness inside. i would definitely come by again to order more of those!"
344,Victor S.,1117,1,8/28/18,"i love all the food wings, pot stickers, noods , but service is bad which they get away with because of the popularity. we get there with three parties ahead of us on the board. the host seats three other parties who come in after us.i then have to just ask for a table because the whiteboard system does not really work. that was min which is not horrible.we wait for min for a server. tables that came in after us already have food on the table. put in orders of wings and order of pot stickers. min later we get order of wings. min later a waiter comes over and drops off the check. i ask where the rest of the food is and he tells me what i ordered and then i have to point out we did not get pot stickers either. at this point all the tables have turned over with new guests. we get the rest of the initial order in the next min and they said they meant to bring it at different times. hours to have delicious wings and awesome potstickers ."
345,Laura S.,1117,5,8/22/18,"i think this place is absolutely worth the hype. all of my friends have been telling me to try it out and i'm so glad that i took my parents there when they are visiting. the open at pm for dinner and there is a line starting around . some people who came before still had to wait so get there early or expect to wait longer. the place quickly fills up and is not the best place for a romantic date, but if you are looking for good food, definitely hit it. we got the famous fried chicken wings must have, so good, the honey walnut prawns fried perfectly, so crisp and yummy with the right amount of mayo and fantastic walnuts. we also ordered their black bean noodles and eggplant. i'm not a big fan of the other two dishes, but just their chicken wings and honey walnut prawn will keep me coming back. i've noticed some people it is chinese food. just want to clarify that it is not authentic food. we do not eat dry fried chicken wings or prawns with mayo lol . but it is sooooo delicious! i have not tried san tung but heard they share the same chef except that they do not have dumplings or potstickers . will definitely try the other one out and come back with an update."
346,Emily Y.,1117,5,7/13/18,"you are missing out if you have not try this place! this is a must eat place and highly recommend it! parking here may be a hassle, have to circle around multiple times to pray for parking god. finally found and parked at residential area and walk to the restaurant. the wait time could be long during peak hours, there is a paper hanging at the wall for dinein & takeout waitlist, just write your name on there with a party number next to it. once it is done, just hangout and wait outside. if you do not want to wait, san tung next door is always a lot less people waiting in line and can be seated in a shorter wait time they do not sell potstickers dumplings. i mean there is a reason why people rather wait in a long time for this place than next door which they supposed to serve you equivalent food fishes, ya know . you be the judge and decide where to go and eat! this place is definitely worth my time to wait and we ordered the following amazing dishes, i swear each dish is on crack, very addicting and ridiculously delicious with loads of heavy tasting of sodium for sure, but they are sooo good. . shrimp & leek dumpling im never a big fan of leek, but these dumplings are simply tasty with handmade dumpling doughy wrap with fully stuffed of meats, leek and shrimp inside. i was not expecting much outta this, but it turned out to be pretty good. dumplings were kinda small but it was more like a one bite size for me and served as good appetizer. we got too hungry and devoured these dumplings in no time right after they served to ya after the long wait time approx. mins hr . jjajiangmyun . black bean sauce was well made and once mixed well with freshly cooked noodles, it was ready to eat. i did not like much of the big pieces of onions which was overpowering the overall taste , but loved the thinly slice of cucumber in there. since this place mostly served we ordered mostly heavy taste foods, so comparing to other dishes, this one became kinda bland and i had to mix up with more chili spicy sauce in order to taste the food! . dried spicy chicken wings they put crack on there i swear lol , each piece of fried chicken wing was wellmarinated and well mixed up with spicy, sweet and saltiness. loved the crispy outside and mighty batters and served super hot and came right out to your table, it was super addictive and i could not stop eating them. my friend said even leftover reheated up was still very surprisingly deliciousness. can totally see why every table orders this infamous dried spicy chicken wings, could not agree more this is the best chicken wings i've ever had! . stir fried green beans this was a must order if you want some greens lol . it was salty sweet and oily dish, but better to eat some greens than nothing, right!!! lots of sodium & sugar & spicy sauce make every dish tasted so freaking delicious. i could so tell because the next day i woke up, my face and body was feeling super bloated, and my double eyelids even got disappeared and became single eyelid lolllllll . imagine the amount of sodium, msg and other stuffs they put in the foods, do not get me wrong! i love their foods, and it was definitely worth my trip to visit and dine in here. i will be back for sure yummmmm ^^"
347,Jason M.,1117,4,6/28/18,"tip skip the line and order takeout. you are a block away from the park and the botanical gardens are nearby. i really really wanted the wet fried chicken wing sauce to be outstanding. it was great and i really enjoyed the wings. these are not wimpy, scrimpbytheirreputation sized wings. this is a full batch. so, size wise a grown man will be satisfied with one order of wings. but, the sauce was not as sweet or spicy as i wanted. the sauce fell somewhere in the middle which left me wanting more. the potstickers were great. i loved that the stickers were thick and breaded. the meat mixture had a nice flavor. here again, i really wanted the excess sauce from the fried chicken to be available to dip the stickers. i did that but it just was not all that i hoped for. i will return and try the dry fried chicken wings."
348,Luke L.,1117,4,6/25/18,"you know why you are here yup you are here for those legendary chicken wings. the name san tung translates to the word shan dong a province in china and the province is best known for its dumplings. since the province is just one yellow sea away from korea, san tung's menu also have several korean influenced dishes. our group got here minutes before the opening time and the restaurant opened minutes early pm . initially the restaurant was % filled up, but by the time we walked out at pm the restaurant was completely packed. food did take a while to come out + minutes , but service was actually pretty good comparing with other chinese restaurants english friendly menu & waiters spoke good english . five spice beef noodle # sliced five spice beef and tendon in a bowl of fresh homemade soup noodles accompanied with spinach, this was the first beef noodle soup i had with broth that contains pieces of ginger, but broth had an interesting aroma and tasted slightly spicy. beef and tendon had star worthy meltinyourmouth texture. noodle was pretty mediocre. it was a good beef noodle soup, but i had better one in southern california e.g. sinbala restaurant & corner beef noodle house . original dry fried chicken # chicken wings deep fried in butter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers pieces of wings for . this is san tung's # signature item. each wing was covered in addicting sweet and sour sauce with slightly spicy kick. chicken quality was pretty good too not too dry and pretty meaty. if you are a fan of kfc not colonel sanders i mean korean fried chicken , then you will appreciate san tung's fried chicken because these wings also had similar sweet & spicy flavor profiles. overall a solid . star on food. p.s. san tung has a sister restaurant right next door san tung , but the sister restaurant does not sell potstickers and dumplings."
349,Victor V.,1117,5,6/6/18,"amazing food and probably the best potstickers i've ever tried. for the price it is totally worth it, definitely coming back here again!"
350,Chul L.,1117,4,6/2/18,"came here on a saturday for lunch. there was a long waiting list, but we were lucky enough to just wait for about mins. my friend took us here as he recommended this restaurant. the food is amazing!!! i highly recommend their potstickers . its super juicy and has so much flavor. totally different from the usual potstickers you get from the supermarket. at first we were debating if we should go to the same # restaurant next door but we decided to wait a little longer and try their main restaurant. it was really worth the wait!! san tung no next door do not offer potstickers . did not know how good the potstickers were until i tried it. definitely worth the wait. just for the potstickers . parking can be a bit hectic, as they do not have a private lot and you have to find limited parking on the street. we were lucky enough to find a parking spot right next to the restaurant, but it get can tough. fyi, their fried chicken is really good as well."
351,Yennhu N.,1117,5,5/29/18,"i first heard of san tung through social media, years ago. everyone would post pictures of their chicken wings and green beans with high praise. but i never really had the desire to try it, because its just asian food. but one day, i happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. and since then, i've been making san tung a regular stop whenever i'm in sf, and introducing it to all my friends. my first time here, i came on a saturday night, during prime time. it was about a minute wait for people. once seated, we ordered the original dry fried chicken, dried sauteed string beans, combination chow mein and potstickers with a bowl of rice. the dry fried chicken was hands down, the best asian fried chicken i've ever had. the wings were cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. each order comes with about wings. the sauce goes great on top of white rice too! the string beans were really good too. it complimented the chicken. the chow mein was a it too oily, but still delicious. the potstickers were massive. i recommend sharing the plate of with people. my top two favorite things were the wings and green beans, definitely a must try. the customer service here was okay. they are very busy so sometimes its hard to get the server's attention. the atmosphere of the restaurant itself resembles any other chinese family restaurant. the parking situation here is very bad though. located in a very popular area, its hard to come across street parking. i had to circle around for minutes before finding something. overall, i highly recommend giving this place a try. its a good place to go with a bigger group of people, that way, you can do family style meal. pro tip there is a san tung right next door, put your name on both and see which one gets called first. from my experience, san tung has a shorter wait time. but there are a few items, like dumplings, that are not served here."
352,Ashley M.,1117,5,5/7/18,"incredible staff. yes there is going to be a wait because it is worth it. ordered the famous dry fried wings, potstickers a must, dry black bean noodles, and rice. everything was superb. cannot wait to go back. make sure you stay close to the board where you add your name. some guest changed our party number from to probably to get a table sooner."
353,Big F.,1117,5,5/7/18,"came here for the first time on a saturday after a short hike. since the original san tung was super busy, we decided to go next door to san tung # . # does not offer potstickers or dumplings according to the sign. we ordered the fried chicken wings with drumsticks and the jalapeno black bean noodle since every table seems to have a bowl of noodles. the chicken wings were amazing, so crispy, crunchy, flavorful with ginger, garlic, soy sauce taste. i have had smoother texture of the chicken wing flesh but these wings definitely win first place for flavor! i was also surprised with the noodle, they really infused the jalapeno into the black bean sauce. compared with the korean version, this one is less oily and more texture to the sauce. i would definitely definitively want to come back."
354,Lincoln C.,1117,4,4/14/18,"famous chicken. potstickers out of this world. black bean noodles. dumplings with chives are excellent. fast and friendly service. i will definitely come back here, i really liked it!"
355,Selina H.,1117,5,3/20/18,"wow this place definitely lives up to the hype!! came from la to try their dry fried chicken wings and i was not disappointed. we ordered the chicken wings, black bean noodles, sauteed dry string beans, potstickers , and steamed pork dumplings. the dishes that stood out to me the most were the chicken wings and the string beans. the sauce for the wings is super unique and it is so addicting. i also wish they had black vinegar, but they only had white vinegar so i did not really like the sauce i made for my dumplings. the line can be pretty long, but it actually goes by pretty fast so do not be intimidated. it is worth the wait! i really wish they had a location in la "
356,Shannon H.,1117,4,3/5/18,"yummy yummy fried chicken magic. . do not miss out on the fried chicken. . the potstickers are also super bomb. . absolutely do not miss out on the fried chicken wet or dry but the sauce they put on it is really magic. so this place gets ridiculously crowded for dinner time i've driven past the crowds on the way home but at lunch actually it was not too bad. there was about a min wait while they cleared out a table for our party of two. the place is fairly spacious with lots of room for big parties but they also have some four tops for those that are traveling lighter. we ordered the fried chicken, potstickers on the recommendation of a coworker and fellow yelpers , honey walnut shrimp, and the shrimp and leek dumplings. all really tasty. the honey walnut shrimp is probably pretty standard and i've had better dumplings at other places but these were still pretty good. i would recommend the fried chicken did i say that enough yet and the potstickers if you are at a loss. they have lunch specials and the lunch special fried chicken was pcs as opposed to . they are served wet or dry and i thought we ordered ours dry but they came with a sauce on it. which i would think would be the wet ones either way they were still super good. parking sucks here. it is irving and no matter when you go, it will be pretty tough. meters and some free street parking on the side streets if you are extra lucky."
357,Christina N.,1117,4,1/28/18,"came here on a tuesday evening for dinner and there was a short wait. we ordered some of the yelp recommended dishes and they were all pretty good. fried chicken yep, must order! the sauce is sweet and tangy. chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy tender inside. yum! sizzling rice soup peppery soup perfect for a cool night. will order again! dried sauteed green bean this was sweet, which was a little odd for me since i'm used to a more garlicky version of this dish. it was good, but probably not for me. potstickers this was okay. the dumplings were fairly large in size but the filling was generous and the skin was thin. the restaurant feels more like they were serving american chinese food with how sweet the dishes were. i would not make a trip here specially for it, but it is a solid choice if you are around the area!"
358,Valerie D.,1117,4,1/20/18,"i'm probably going to receive a lot of flack for this but this place is overhyped. there, i said it. the potstickers were good. the dumplings were good. the wings were bomb. would i line up at am or am to eat here though nooope! the wings are crunchy and the sauce is the perfect concoction of sweet, bbqlike, and sticky but i cannot fathom the idea of lining up for these wings. do not get me wrong though the food is good but i was not blown away. we arrived about minutes before san tung opened for dinner and were one of the only few people in line. however, this place quickly got filled minutes into dinner service. parking was a breeze too so i would recommend coming early! verdict skip the early morning line and come for dinner."
359,Yien S.,1117,4,1/3/18,"tried this place for the first time with a large party. loved how crispy their dry fry chicken was but, the sauce was a little too sweet for me and the drumettes were kind of on the small side. some of the potstickers we got had holes on the bottom, i guess it really stuck to the pot lol . the other dishes we ordered were fine, nothing special green beans, chow mein, fried rice, eggplant and dry fry shrimp heavy on white pepper. service was just ok for a typical asian restaurant , water was not refilled, they forgot a couple of dishes but was prompt when notified and when i asked for some hot water, server gave it to me in a glass, not a mug so it was kind of difficult to pick up. i would return just for the chicken wings but will ask for light sauce."
360,Crystal T.,1117,5,11/9/17,great freaking food!!! omg!! i went with some new friends. they told me the food is good. maaaaan is it!! people were fighting over their names on the board . you have to put your name on the board for the next available table. you will have to wait about an hour and a half for a table. it is worth the wait!! you must order the chicken wings!! i notice every table had two orders of wings. my first bite.i understood why. best wings i ever had!!! i should have order some to go. we order dumpling . potstickers .mushu pork.chowmien white rice. make sure you order green beans. everything was star!!! i see why my friends drive an hour to the city and wait another hour to two hours to eat the most delicious chinese food! i will be making the same pilgrimage.
361,Christina S.,1117,5,9/21/18,better get used to waiting. but know that this is what you get dry black bean sauce noodles and original dried fried chicken. these are the classics they make to perfection.
362,Randy P.,1117,3,9/9/18,"first of all, lemme state that i do not live in the inner sunset neighborhood with convenience of arrival. it is a mile round trip. so my expectations were high. expectations were further amplified by pbs's check please recommendation as well as another foodie buddy. i must say i liked the caramelized sweetspicy sauce plus the nice surface crunch of their famous dry fried chicken wings. the meat inside though can be a bit tough, compared to the sublime powdered honey butter korean fried chicken at vons in the south bay. overall, the taste of sweetness dominates. and if you also order their dry black bean sauce noodle with seafood, the sweetness of these dishes combined become sorta overwhelming. dry fried chicken sauteed string beans shrimp and leek dumplings . stars dry black bean noodles "
363,Celine L.,1117,4,9/3/18," , + reviews & . stars for fried chicken put this place on the map for my boyfriend and me. upon arriving we saw a large crowd of people waiting outside so my boyfriend dropped me off in front while he went to look for parking. your whole party needs to be here in order to be seated . the whiteboard to write your name is to your right as soon as you enter. put your name down and wait. the place is relatively small, so not much space but i did notice a small separate dining room for a larger party. it was not that long before we were seated maybe minutes i'm pretty patient so wait times do not bother me too much. we ordered orders of the original dry fried chicken not sure why it is called dry because they are the exact opposite. chicken is moist and covered in sauce . the sauce is sweet, tangy, and salty. it has some red pepper flakes in it. reminded me of panda express's orange chicken but better. plus they use drummettes & wings. this is what they are known for and my boyfriend and i were fans! soo good. szechuan roasted duck & buns one of my fave chinese wedding dishes which i had to introduce to my mexican boyfriend. he fell in love! he cleaned the bones and basically ate whole thing by himself. i personally think i've had better but i'm just glad he liked it. the dry black bean noodles were alright. definitely nothing out of this world. the texture of the mushy noodles kind of grossed me out. overall i give this place . stars rounding to . the chicken alone made up for the lack of customer service. the servers were disgruntled and some of the plates and tea cups were dirty. overall i had a great time and we took home leftovers."
364,S.K. Y.,1117,4,8/28/18,"more than dozen times i have visited this place. expect killer wait especially in the evening. killer dried fried chicken deep fried in batter with garlic, ginger and roasted red peppers in a thick sweet sauce with a hint of honey dry black bean sauce noodles shrimp, calamari scallops in a dry dark soybean sauce over fresh homemade noodles . noodles with peanut sauce spicy shrimp, scallops, chopped water chestnuts, mushrooms, onions spicy peanut sauce in a bowl of fresh homemade noodles ."
365,Cecilia Y.,1117,5,8/26/18,"i've wanted to visit this place for over five years but have not had the chance to till this past saturday. we came around pm and there was a huge list of people in front of us. thankfully since we were a party of , we took up the bigger table which allowed us to be like the next party. we ordered like plates of the dry fried chicken, order of the wet fried chicken, dry black bean sauce noodles , string beans , rice, and mongolian beef. we ordered the extra plate of fried chicken and the noodles after realizing we were still hungry and that the dishes were that good. the chicken was saucy but still was crispy which i really appreciated. the chicken was not soggy or anything which i loved. it had a kick of spice and a kick of sweetness to it. sooooooo gooood. the wet chicken was not that different from the dry chicken but just slightly sour. it was still very good but my friends and i preferred the dry chicken. the other dishes were honestly so delicious and fresh. had tons of flavor. very affordable chinese food. i am constantly thinking about the fried chicken from here despite only having it once in my life. we devoured all of the dishes bc this place was just that good. i cannot wait to come back here. a must visit when coming to sf."
366,Derek T.,1117,4,7/8/18,"san tung is very popular though i guess you already know that coming here. everyone says to come here for the dry fried chicken, so that is what i came for. now mind you the wait can be incredibly long for dinner and weekends. if you are lucky enough to come on a weekday during lunch then the wait will be closer to minutes as opposed to + minutes. so, expect no service because cantonese restaurants are business only where you order food, eat food, pay, and leave. you are not there for a pleasant conversation with the waiters. so the dry fried chicken had a great crunch to it and the sauce was caked if not caramelized onto the chicken. the dry black bean sauce noodles are good and the meat and veggies are not cut so finely where they all get lost and congregate at the bottom of the bowl. all in all, san tung is good quality food but i would not wait longer than minutes to wait for a table though. so if you want to eat here, come before the lunch or dinner rush or go on a weekday for lunch."
367,Maria P.,1117,4,6/21/18,"when i lived in san francisco this restaurant was located a few blocks away from my home. as you walk in looks like a hole in the wall, located believes someone's house. spacious dining room, clean not spanking clean clean where it is not questionable. how i test cleanliness is if you can take a peek into the kitchen and also see how clean the up keep of the bathroom is. that will give you insight. when we arrived it was late afternoon around pm, not many people which was great because the wait here is exceptionally long. imagine capacity of this restaurant holds and its usually packed. we sat down and got service right away. there was a table nearby where many of the staff were sitting on a round table and the table was filled seriously a mound of fresh green beans . there was about staff members cleaning the green beans . it was fun to watch as they works methodically and quickly. very efficient! as we got our drinks and the menu. menu is several pages which looked like hundreds of selection. when i see a menu that is more than pages i get overwhelmed. what is nice about their menu is it is all very organized under category. we ordered everything that they are known for, chicken wings and the dry black bean sauce noodles with shrimp is amazing and we ordered a few sides of vegetables like black bean eggplant and pan dry sauteed string beans . note the noodles are homemade. the portions are enormous so family style here is perfect. no one will leave hungry. each dish we ordered was delicious and so good that we ordered side of garlic noodles to take on the flight back home to san diego. i would literally fly from sd to sf to purchase the dry black bean sauce noodles , # on noodles section of menu. mind you the eggplant as delicious and succulent as it was. a little oily, so i take my napkin and absorb the extra oil. yes, that is what i do to remove extra calories. value and piece affordable lots of history this restaurant and carve your time to come here. so many other million restaurants in the city, thou this one is special. enjoy and bon apetite!"

369,Ronaldinhio T.,1117,2,3/12/18,"everyone who has lived in the inner sunset or around this area has practically grown up with san tung. however over the years they have become quite repetitive and the lack of variety brings nothing interesting to the place, even if you like chinese food you will end up bored here. the ambiance is okay and for the price you can get a large dish with noodles . i usually have their dry black bean noodles or the chicken wings i like the dry ones . when it comes to this restaurant the only thing dependable about this place is that the taste would always be the same the menu too, it never changes . do not expect exceptional service or to be greeted with a smile. i've had better burgers elsewhere but this is the embodiment of a chinese food."
370,Annie H.,1117,5,2/8/18,"san tung was my favorite meal in san francisco. their popular dry chicken wings were delicious, crispy flavorful. must get item. dry black bean noodles and string beans were also good. i was lucky enough to wait less than mins but my friends has waited over an hour, which i prob would not do for next time."
371,Tony C.,1117,3,1/1/18,"oh man. this one is tough. long lines. got here at pm and the line was long already. they started seating at pm and we got in. but by doing this, it kills the kitchen. food came out sporadically. chicken wings were the last thing to come out. took over minutes. we already finished everything. dry black bean noodles good noodles . good sauce . lots of msg pork dumplings nothing special. average dumplings mushu pork the pancake tortillas were soggy. not house made. the filling was ok. lots of msg. string beans delicious but super sweeeeeeet. chicken wings you get wings for . . which is a dollar a wing. the size of these wings were small average. nothing wow. the sauce is garlic, sugar, red pepper, ginger. it was good. overall delicious place for chinese food. not authentic but still good none the less."
372,LeeAnn B.,1117,5,12/22/17,this is my absolute favorite restraint. the dried fried chicken wings are so crispy and the sauce is delicious. the dry black bean sauce noodles are also delicious. i am from san jose but make the trip to san francisco just to visit this restaurant
373,Alex L.,1117,5,11/2/17,"so many great reviews coming from this place, that i must try! san tung is actually the first restaurant my girlfriend and i had arriving to san francisco. i've never been to san francisco, but everyone has been talking about it. all my friends who have came here mentioned the dry fried chicken wings!! we walked inside and it was already pretty busy by noon. i'm so glad we made it in time before the rush of locals came through. we put our name down and were sat down at a table within ten minutes. pretty happy we did not have to wait because i hear it is sometimes a long wait. anyways! so we ordered the dry fried chicken wings, the dry black ban noodles , and the dumplings. the dry black ban noodles and the dumplings came out first. i'm glad it did because i will tell you right now that it was not as good as i thought it would be. the noodles were plain and the sauce did not have any flavor at all. it was just ok, i do not think i would have it again to be honest. the dumplings had a lot of flavor to it, you did not need to add extra soy sauce to it. however, there was too much leech in it and not enough shrimp. saving the last dish for last! time for the main dish! the dry fried chicken wings. hands down, i only give this restaurant five stars because of this dish. other then that i do not think i would recommend anything else. the chicken was so good, it is not your normal chicken wings. very crispy, tender, and the right amount of spices. golden and the sauce on top of it was bomb! please do yourself a favor and order like a gang of these and have some rice also lol. crazy how one dish taste so much better then the rest. i heard the green beans were good! i will have to come back one day to try those with the chicken."
374,Laura C.,1117,3,10/28/17,"i first visited san tung many years ago could not remember the experience, and have been wanting to go back. recently had the chance to pay a visit timing was great as we went during the weekend, right as they were opening for dinner. no wait, but after minutes or so, the place was full. it is a small spot, but looks like they also own the building next door to hold additional diners. feels like your standard asian restaurant not really nice or fancy, but not a complete hole in the wall either. of course, we got their special fried chicken, along with some dumplings and noodles . the dumplings were ok, nothing to really write home about. the presentation was a little dull, so there were no oohs and ahhs when it was dropped off on our table. the dry black bean sauce noodles were ok too the portion size seemed smaller than what i had expected and it is supposed to have seafood. i could barely seefood, only a few pieces. this was a bit of a bummer. as for their fried chicken, i did not see it standing out beyond the likes of places like bonchon. sure, it is good, but i'm short of calling it amazingly special. the food did not wow me, and i felt that prices were a few dollars higher on each entree than other chinese places. i think the popularity of this place has allowed them to increase the prices, but i personally did not feel the quality or quantity was worth it. it is not a bad place, but was not great either. service was on par with other chinese restaurants. i'm glad i finally had a chance to come back after so many years, but not sure if i will be back. did feel overhyped."
375,Jessa May C.,1117,4,9/23/17,"pros the fried chicken is probably the best item on the menu! it was crispy and sweet, and enough to share taste! the non dry ] black bean noodles were also pretty, not too salty nor sweet, and very moist in comparison to chow mein. cons it was really busy and took us a while to get seated. also, the fried chicken took a lot longer to get out in comparison to the black bean noodles . would try again, but maybe just for the fried chicken togo!"
376,D R.,1117,5,9/11/17,"the best fried chicken ever!! order one togo and it is still crispy when you reheat it the next day. also, the sauteed green beans are very fresh and flavorful. last thing, go for the dry black bean noodles too! parking is a bit difficult and lines could get long but totally worth the wait!"
377,Hanyu Z.,1117,4,8/13/17,"after hearing many many good reviews about sun tung, we finally gave it a try. came here on a saturday for dinner and the restaurant was packed. waited for about mins to get seated. with k plus reviews on yelp, the waiting time was actually much better than we expected ordered their signature dry fried chicken wings, came with pieces. the chicken wings were legit, crispy and tender, covered by this awesome sweet sauce with some red chili pepper. love it! we also ordered their shrimp dumpling and dry black bean sauce noodle . the shrimp dumplings came with pieces and were surprisingly good! tasted like home made dumplings with rich ingredients. really really good dumplings. dry black bean sauce noodle was just ok. it has zucchini, scallops, shrimps, onions covered by black sauce . it does not taste like the traditional chinese dry black bean sauce noodle anymore, and i was a little disappointed."
378,Stephanie Ann L.,1117,5,7/28/17,"this is the spot to come to whenever you are in sf however be ready to wait if you come at peak hours. there is a white board you write your name on for the wait list, but be careful if people erase anything. there are little to no space to wait inside so outside is where everyone is at it is kind of a drag when it is cold windy. fortunately most of the time i've come the most i've had to wait was about minutes. there was one time i left because the wait was waaayy too long. there were also a couple times we made the drive out and the were closed when their hours said they would be open! i do recommend calling ahead to see if they are open because it was at random times! but still stars because i will always come back. one time i came with my bf and we sat at a table of and was sitting with another group of and to get seated faster. it was cool we got seated right away and was able to order. we did not mind and the other parties were cool were not distracting or anything. the original dry fried chicken always a must have, paired w the green beans . sooo good, but i would always get rice w the chicken to balance the flavors. you usually get about pieces of the wings which is more than enough when you order additional food which you should to try everything else esp if you waited. i've also had the dumpings, dry black bean sauce noodles , and fried rice. which is all very, very good."
379,Desmond C.,1117,4,6/23/17,"pretty damn solid food. come here for the dry fried chicken wings!! they are amazing. i came here around pm on a sunday. surprisingly the wait was not too long. in fact, i stepped away with my party for half an hour and they crossed out my name since they called us and we were not there at the time . regardless, after talking with the waiter, we were seated when the next free table opened up y what we ordered dry fried chicken wings . you see every table have a plate of this and it is not hard to see why. the sauce is super tasty and sweet, and you can occasionally taste a very small hint of spicy very small though because there are a few chopped up red chili peppers. in addition, the wings are super crispy coming out. i do not know about you but it is so much more satisfying biting into a crunchy chicken wing than a soggy one. that, the sauce , and the warm tender meat made this dish a must have. hell, i would bring my friends here to binge on the wings. garlic eggplants . very garlicky taste. i love garlic so this is a solid dish. warm and moist eggplant was yummy, and like the wings, had a verry small hint of spicy. black bean sauce noodles . . i actually mistakenly ordered the dry black bean sauce noodles , but the waiter was very good and got us some of the sauce for the non dry noodles . it was decent, but nothing spectacular. not much squid meat in it though, which was slightly disappointing. i would not mind getting it again."
380,Joe J.,1117,3,9/18/16,terrible service but good dried fried chicken wings and dry black bean noodle . the regular black bean noodle is not that great
381,Christine H.,1119,5,11/1/18,"this review is for the views and their award winning clam chowder which was voted first place in a fisherman's wharf contest.means a lot since there are numerous clam chowder spots here the views are great here you can see alcatraz, the bridge, etc . the service is pleasant, efficient, and professional. the clam chowder and sourdough bread are delicious! plus, it was only ish for a decentsized bowl of clam chowder .totally worth it considering that this is a pretty highend place with a super nice view . clam chowder details lots of clam , lots of veggies, and a perfectly warm and seasoned chowder .with a toasted and heavenly piece of sourdough bread.enuf.said. note it is probably wise to make a reservation. also, they have this automatic sf surcharge i forgot what it was for ."
382,Elena N.,1119,3,10/1/18,"so i decided to do a touristy day. since a friend and i were going to be at fisherman's wharf, i suggested doing a seafood dinner at pier . i made a reservation through yelp for a party of two about a week prior for thursday, september th at pm. we showed up a few mins early and had to wait for a little bit. we were seated about mins after our reservation at a table by the window, so we had a nice view. red chili garlic shrimp red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic award winning clam chowder bowl garlic roasted whole dungeness crab served with vegetables and roasted fingerling potatoes and butter ultimate dirty martini tito's vodka, dry vermouth, olive juice and a blue cheese stuffed olive barrel aged manhattan up bulliet bourbon, carpano antica formula sweet vermouth house aged in liter oak barrels duckhorn napa valley, california ' i wanted the crab and clam chowder . since my friend and i always over order, we added the shrimp. the clam chowder was nice and creamy with a good amount of clams . a little thicker than i prefer, but still a good bowl. the crab was a little disappointing. there was not enough garlic flavor. plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. it was just an empty she will for decoration. if a restaurant states a whole crab, i think that should include the head. the shrimp were okay. had a nice heat, but i did not really like the sauce. a little too sweet for me. dinner came with complimentary bread & butter, which was good for soup dipping. service here was nice and friendly. they were busy cuz there was a convention in town, so there were times when we had to flag down our server. the wine was good and paired well with our food. both cocktails were okay. a little light for my tastes, but at least the pricing was not too bad. a nice dinner for a touristy spot, but the food was a little underwhelming. stars."
383,Lisa E.,1119,5,9/21/18,"came here with a friend for the first time. great service from our server beautiful views even though we sat in the back room. ordered a delicious malbec through the urging of our server yummy. i ordered the award winning clam chowder and indeed they are correct. followed it with the mixed grill, all was cooked to perfection. would come here again in a heartbeat."
384,Yixuan L.,1119,5,9/11/18,"food this is a great place to go for special occasions! i've celebrated many birthdays, anniversaries, and valentine's days here. i've always sat near the windows for a beautiful view of the water. my absolute favorites on the menu would have to be the award winning clam chowder . the calamari is one of the best i've tried, and i'm a huge sea food lover. it is paired with fried onions and jalapenos. the dipping is a creamy aioli sauce that truly brings out the flavor of the calamari. for the entree, i usually order the linguini and clams . the amount of clams that is served is unbelievable! if you are not in the mood for something super heavy, i would go with this dish to satisfy any seafood cravings. it also comes with a slice of garlic bread that pairs really well with the sauce. my family is a huge fan of the shellfish platter. although it is a bit on the pricier end, it encompasses all the seafood favorites that anyone can ever wish for in a meal! mussels, clams , shrimp, and half a dungeness crab. price & portions clam chowder i usually go with a cup, but for an additional you can get a large bowl to share between people! calamari i would say for a plate, it can comfortably serve people as a starter dish! linguini and clams not a lot of pasta, but still quite filling. shellfish platter ~ for a sizable amount of seafood overall opinion if you are ever on pier , this is a musttry, not only is the food delicious but the ambiance is one of a kind. service here is wonderful, the waiters really make an effort to ensure your time there is welltaken care of!"
385,Jay R.,1119,5,8/19/18,"this place was amazing. from the fresh bread & butter to our appetizers and main dishes. we chose to have their award winning clam chowder and we understand exactly why it was award winning . steamed clams , caesar salad as appetizers. all dishes were amazing along with a wonderful wine list. we sat next to a clean large window with beautiful views of the bay. customer service was on point and we got seated quickly since we had reservations. we will definitely return for many more trips."
386,Courtney L.,1119,5,8/14/18,"during my family's trip to san francisco, our mission was to find a restaurant that showcased the bay's fresh seafood at fairly reasonable prices, and fog harbor delivered! located on the second floor of pier , this restaurant has a classy ambiance and a scenic view of the water where you can spot the sea lions in the distance. we were greeted by our waiter who took great care of us throughout dinner. he was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. we started off our seafood feast by sharing the red chili garlic shrimp appetizer . it contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce. although i enjoyed the spicy flavors and tingling heat, i did not find that it was the best value. i also could not help but try a cup of their award winning clam chowder , which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. yum, this is a must! for my entree, i went with a lighter plate, being the seared pacific cod . the fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. it was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. the aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and i loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. with the cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. two of my family members ordered the mixed grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. they enjoyed their entrees as well. this was easily one of the best seafood meals my family had in years. thank you to fog harbor for such a memorable dinner to start off our visit to san francisco on the right foot! . stars."
387,Mike N.,1119,1,8/4/18,"the restaurant has great ambience while still in the prime location of pier . however today i was deeply disappointed with their service. we had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. we had the award winning clam chowder , dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna. the clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. the crab cakes were good as well. i liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. but the service here, was just terrible. our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. we had to ask for everything, straws, etc . our table was never cleared at anytime either. all of our plates were just sitting on the table. i was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. the oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. the ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. after paying + dollars is this what i should expect by all means i have no issue spending money on food. but it really just hits a nerve when i get crappy service and i'm paying for it. i would go else where if your thinking about the fog harbor fish house."
388,Cindy G.,1119,3,8/1/18,"waited minutes to hour for dinner as no reservations were available. enjoyed wandering around fisherman's wharf and the time passed rather painlessly. given the review and crowds, i was looking forward to a tasty dinner. i started with their award winning clam chowder . the temperature of my chowder was tepid, otherwise the soup was creamy and full of clams . my dinner choice was the crab roll. i really wanted to try their crab but was lazy and did not want to get messy work dinner . i think a little celery salt and a lot less mayo would have helped. the fries were hot, crispy and nicely salted. the complementary hot sourdough roll was the best thing i ate."
389,M C.,1119,5,7/23/18,this is a great place to visit on the pier if you are looking for a delicious family dinner or lunch. the view of alcatraz was breathtaking. the steak with whiskey sauce is very good. award winning clam chowder is amazing! service was quick and convenient. by far my favorite place on the pier.
390,Surf City M.,1119,5,7/14/18,"the crab roll was legit! full of crab, celery and a light sauce on toasted sourdough. i also tried the award winning clam chowder which was really good. my family and i were seated in a nice spot with view of alcatraz and enjoyed some nice cocktails."
391,Ralph R.,1119,5,6/25/18,"went for lunch while in san francisco. it is a large restaurant on pier on the upper level. the window seats overlook the harbor and the sea lion resting area . we started with the award winning clam chowder and i could certainly see why it won the award . it was delicious. so was the dungeness crab cocktail. of course we had to have the cioppino which was fantastic. the steamed whole dungeness crab was well received. and the crab ceviche was outstanding. not only was the food very good, so was the service."
392,Vickie Z.,1119,5,6/4/18,"do not let the location of pier scare you off as a tourist trap. having lived in the city for over years, this is one of the best seafood places i've ever had. recommend making reservations so you can ask for a window seat next to the water. oh, and the seals. the meal clam chowder for bowl this is their award winning clam chowder . wowza, i could see why! forget boudin, this is the winner right here. they give you so much variety and freshness of seafood in this bowl of goodness right here. plus, no need for a bread bowl when they serve complimentary sourdough bread for the table. imo, dipping the bread and soaking up all the chowder flavor is much better than having a bread bowl. mmm! jumbo scallop & crab risotto seasonal item. wow again. these were some of the best scallops i've ever had in my life. they were so buttery and juicy and perfectly seared. the risotto was creamy and the crab made it even more flavorful. the dab of pesto was a nice touch. cioppino ok to be fair, by the time this came out, i had stuffed myself silly with sourdough bread and the above two dishes. this was still amazing though. very flavorful and wonderfully decorated with an abundant of seafood. no tough pieces, everything f are e s h. note, they provide you bibs so do not be afraid to get the cioppino the normal way and opt out of the additional services for the readytoeat way . all their menu items come from % sustainable seafood. additionally, service was wonderful. they knew we were sharing all items, and split our entrees into two beautifully plated dishes. everything was divine."
393,HeeYoung Y.,1119,4,6/4/18,super kind services and great foods and drink! award winning clam chowder was no need to say. i recommend a bread bowl one rather than regular ones. garlic roasted crab was fantastic. it serves for two perfectly.
394,Andrew P.,1119,5,4/23/18,had a great brunch here yesterday. we ordered a seafood tower and their award winning clam chowder . everything came out quick and was well prepared. service was good and we were seated right away at opening. we had a reservation via open table although we did not need it but it is always good to reserve just in case with popular places like this. the view of the bay overlooks the gg bridge and alcatraz island. i would recommend this place if you like good seafood.
395,Anthony N.,1119,5,4/19/18,"have you ever wish you could enjoy a delightful meal with a breathtaking view of the ocean. there is just something soothing about listening to the waves crashing upon the shore. for many, it can be very therapeutic and a comforting experience to indulge in. add a glass of wine and your significant other to the picture and you will never want to leave that moment of euphoria. so if you are ever around, fog harbor would be the perfect getaway for this kind of occasion. f.h.f.h was not apart of my friend's and i agenda. we had initially stop by to check out the pier but ended up giving this place a try. we had walked in during one of their slow nights of a while back ago and got immediately seated at the bar. we had a couple of luggages on us so we did not opt for any tables. the bartender who was working behind the bar was also our server as well. he initially greeted himself and took our beverage orders. as my friend and i were glancing through their array of seafood selections, we both wanted to get two appetizer to share. we were not as hungry but we were willing to see what this place has to offer. we ended up ordering the mussels and their award winning clam chowder bowl. they provided complimentary bread to us which was great to dip with the mussels. several minutes later, our meals had came out and we both started digging in. the mussels were perfectly cooked and marinated in the white wine broth. there was a subtle taste coming from the roasted garlic and a sweet tang from the tomatoes. a beautifully well executed dish i must say. as for the clam chowder bowl, the sourdough bread felt as it was freshly baked from the oven. the exterior of the bread was still nice and crunchy and the inside was soft like marshmallows. the clam chowder had chunks of potatoes, bits of chopped clam and also had a rich tasting cream broth. the juices from clams and cream were in perfect harmony which provided that sweet and savory component to the dish. i very much enjoyed since i am a huge sourdough fanatic. i highly recommend this to others! my overall experience was a superb one. their customer service was right on the dime and the quality of seafood was worth every penny. the panoramic window scenery was definitely a experience to remember."
396,Jasmine P.,1119,5,2/11/18,"the fog harbor fish house was a magnificent venue to celebrate my birthday. our seating could not have been more perfect with a view of the sf bay and to sausalito, the food was flavorful & all deliciousness and the staff was pleasant, attentive & friendly. i was craving for a whole crab along with a side of pasta & veggies. their award winning clam chowder also lives up to its reputation. i left there very satisfied. we will be back soon on our next visit. thank you for a splendid dining experience. it was a beautiful afternoon evening to be in sf."
397,Hai L.,1119,5,1/14/18,"it is hard deciding on a place to eat when you are at pier . there are so many opportunities and places to check out. after a lot of searching, decided to check out this place based on a large amount of positive reviews. this is an institution that serves fresh seafood and gives off a scenic view of the pier. the dining experience and views of the bay area and golden gate bridge attracts visitors and tourists to visit this restaurant at least once. there appeared to be a half hour wait due to how busy it was. not a problem. the wait seemed to go by immediately and suddenly we were already inside the restaurant. fog harbor is said to serve % sustainable seafood which could be a bias to anyone who has not tried it. the menu offers a great selection of food. customers get to enjoy complimentary sourdough bread that is baked in house. to start off with the appetizer, we decided to go with a dozen baked oysters that consists of spinach, bacon, and creamy parmesan sauce. these oysters were incredible. it felt like they popped right in your mouth and had so much flavor. i decided to also get the award winning clam chowder bread bowl! this was amazing as well. for the entree, i decided to go with the mixed grill platter that is made with grilled salmon, pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, sauteed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. food was prepared instantly and did not take long to bring out. the waiter was really friendly but did not bring out water drinks immediately to begin with. had to give him a reminder. no problem. for a beverage, i also went with the oz flint and steel sauvignon that was recommended by the waiter. this wine pairs well with fish and had a stronger taste. i would give this restaurant stars based on the food. price is a bit on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. amazing views depending on where you are seated along with fresh seafood right near the pier. definitely would go again!"
398,Joanne S.,1119,4,1/14/18,"every time my mom comes to sf i take her to get seafood at fog harbor fish house. great view of the bay and alcatraz, located at pier so lots of touristy things to do within walking distance. of course, with the tourist location comes tourist prices but it is not that bad. in terms of food, their award winning clam chowder is quite good particularly with the added crab . we usually come for the lobster very fresh and dungeness crab the garlic is seriously good! this is their best dish! we have had some other dishes here and there that were reliably good but nothing that springs to mind years later. service is usually quite good and you can get seated usually within an hour even if there is a wait no problem there is lots to do while you wait! this time around we got the clam chowder again as well as the seared pacific cod and the mussel fries. the mussel fries were fabulous being a seafood house you might not expect their fries to be top notch but they are, and the cream sauce was delicious. the pacific cod, which was the dish recommended by our waiter, was honestly our least favorite dish that we have tried here. i generally prefer for my cod to have that juicy, oily mouthfeel and the cod was a little dry, maybe due to the thickness of the fish do not know if you can tell from the picture but it was about inch thick when it arrived on the table . however our waiter was fabulous at everything else, including getting our check to us early as we had lost track of time and had an upcoming appointment. my brother usually comes with us and always gets the burger because he does not like seafood. it is alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger it does comes with those delicious fries. tl dr great views, great service, great area, generally great food. get the clam chowder , lobster, mussel fries, and % get the dungeness crab. do not expect too much from the nonseafood options. expect tourist prices given it is a tourist location to me it is worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway. we will be coming back!"
399,Jennie N.,1119,5,12/30/17,"i usually void fisherman's wharf especially around the holidaysgetting run over by strollers and pedestrians just are not my thang but i was in a rather cheery mood and decided to take in the christmas decorations before they get torn down. we decided to have dinner at fog harbor fish house thanks to yelp reviews and they did not disappoint. for starters, we had the calamari, red chili garlic shrimp and mussel fries. all were quite tasty, particularly the garlic shrimp. that sauce had the right amount of spice and kick. we followed with their award winning clam chowder in a bread bowlthick and creamy with plenty of clam chunks. just yums! for the main course, we ordered the cioppino, ahi tuna and seafood penne. my little tot had the chicken tenders. all are highly recommended including the tendersvery meaty and well.tender. everything was great but what really brought this review from a star experience to is our waiter, justin. he was accommodating and made sure our dinner experience was an unforgettable one. we were all pleasantly surprised by justin's attentiveness, how fresh the food was and our overall experience considering the restaurant is in a tourist trap. if you are in the area and do not mind the wait and the crowds, fog harbor is worth the visit."
400,Miriam T.,1119,5,12/30/17,"came in for the award winning clam chowder . i had it topped with crab and caesar salad. the soup was creamy delicious. the iceberg lettuce was fresh and crisped. sliced cheese on top. on the side was warm fresh sliced french roll. altogether was delicious and filling. great customer service. he was friendly and attentive. the day was warm and sunny to enjoy over lunch. restaurant was on the nd floor of pier overlooking the pier water. if you are looking for great clam chowder , this is the place to be."
401,Yol M.,1119,1,11/19/16,we literally just ate there ordering crab cheesy toast and dungeness crab cakes . we only had eggs this morning. no sooner than walking away down embarcadero street my boyfriend began to feel nausea. as we walked a few more minutes he began to throw up near the shops. obviously food poison as he is not sick. his stomach hurt and could not keep down the crab cake ! so upsetting and disappointed
402,Sudesna M.,1119,5,12/21/15,"ambience romantic and scenic. we went around pm in summer and caught the alcatraz islands view in the sun, during sunset and after sunset. it was breathtaking. you can just stare at the bay forever. hubby tried merlot and it was good. the complimentary sourdough bread provided was perfect just the right taste. award winning clam chowder in bread bowl was rich and clamy we ordered the dungeness crab cakes they just melt in your mouth exquisite flavors. must recommended. lobster tail presentation of this dish was very creative and it tasted soft and succulent. fish and chips was not so great. desserts was vanilla bean creme brulee. its freaking awesome.must try."
403,Samantha D.,1119,5,7/14/15,"this place is amazing! the dungeness crab cakes are to die for! i had the clam chowder sourdough bread bowl with crab , and he had the crab sandwich. both were amazing! our server maron was the best! she made wonderful suggestions, and made the dining experience memorable!"
404,Bridget L.,1119,3,7/9/15,"like all of the other posts, this place is a tourist trap. my boyfriend and i sat at the bar since it was my birthday and we wanted to get drinks and apps. my margarita was decent but for i've had it better other places and his lagunita's small jar was . just another way to help tourist spend all their money except i'm not one. the bartenders were not even friendly and when mentioning it was my birthday he asked if i wanted a fireball shot. i was surprised assuming he was offering but then said no, we cannot give you free alcohol but i will give you dessert. i did not go in there looking to celebrate my birthday at pm but hey, i will take a dessert i suppose. once he was bringing the dessert we were getting our check. turns out he charged me for the damn dessert. . and i did not even ask for it. we got the dungeness crab cakes that seemed like they had a good amount of meat but it also had too much seasoning. i like crab cakes because i like the taste of crab . i actually ended up feeling sick after eating this meal."
405,Calvin S.,1119,4,7/7/14," . , +. for service well, fog harbor was my first dinner stop in my day trip down the west coast. our theme was seafood for our san francisco stops, since i personally have never been to the pacific coast and really wanted to test out what is so great about their seafood. we reserved via opentable and had to wait about minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served. our dinner included the award winning clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes , garlic roasted crab , wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. i understood america and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. the garlic roasted crab had to have been at least pounds, and i was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab although she did not even touch the corn cob and potatoes . the lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. the award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name creamy but not too creamy soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. the wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we could not finish it. the lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really did not taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders. service started brilliantly, and quite frankly i do not really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at and we were still eating at i did say the portions were huge!!! . we finally left around and were the last customers departing the restaurant, having finally experienced seafood in the west coast.miles better than the east coast."
406,Linda H.,1119,3,4/30/14,"i'm giving this place stars for service but stars for food. i guess that is why it comes out a . super smiling faces and genuinely nice people that work here but unfortunately have to serve mediocre food. and for these prices i do expect more flavors. their dungeness crab cakes were hugely disappointing with much more filler taste than crab . i do not know if they make their crab cakes fresh but if they did they still taste like preprocessed ones with lots of bread crumbs and salt added. even the remoulade sauce tasted processed also. i really wanted to like this place because the bartenders and drinks and hostess were excellent, but the food fell short."
407,CC C.,1119,4,4/4/14,"my eyes were bigger than my stomach here. had the free bleu cheese garlic bread with the starter dungeness crab cakes and house salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. it all tasted fine, but pricy for the portions that you are served. unable to stop myself, i also got the apple crisp for dessert and it was very good. my server was prompt, attentive, and friendly which made for a nice dining experience. also had an excellent view of the water. a nice place to eat on pier , but pricier. definitely not some place i would come to regularly, but a good place to eat if you are already down by the wharf."
408,Racquel E.,1119,4,10/19/13,"we had an early dinner and a nice view of pier . for appetizers, we had the dungeness crab cakes and our daughter had their award winning clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. hubby had the pacific sole with fingerling potatoes, spinach, peppers, tarragon & capers. i had the mixed grilled salmon, swordfish and shrimp, with citrus buerre blanc, wild rice and steamed broccoli. our daughter had the kids meal fried shrimp & french fries. the food was delicious, and we were too full for dessert. a couple of hours later, we were able to enjoy the fireworks display over the bay."
409,Milton J.,1119,4,10/13/13,"after a quick four and half hour bus tour of san francisco we had a couple of hours left before having to leave port for another destination on a cruise. after doing some research i came across fog harbor fish house at pier on a travel website which had a lot of positive reviews. upon arrival we waited for about fifteen minutes before being seated for a group of three at a corner not far from the crab house. we ordered two cups of clam chowder, and one in a sourdough bowl. apparently the basket of bread was sourdough, so the sourdough bowl was not necessary. the chowder was great as the restaurant claims the best in san francisco. we also ordered crispy bay scallops, dungeness crab cakes , and fried combo breaded fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries and cole slaw . based on the description lots of calories for sure. the scallops, calamari and crab cakes were the best of the lot. it felt like we consumed two meals at once given the portions but it was a great experience. a great way to finish a brief trip to san francisco."
410,Zizzle f.,1119,4,10/13/18,"hey, sometimes you just want the classics for which star is the highest rating unless you invented chowder in .ahem, for spot on seafood classics with all the ambiance of a classic san francisco establishment, fog harbor delivers! really good crab cakes balanced by a bright mango roasted red pepper arugula salad . cleaned, picked, immaculately chilled you grade prawns. smackin clam and bacon loaded chowder celery parsley notes . wedge with lots of bacon and veiny blue, nice bright heirlooms. my dear lobster tails were incredibly sweet and not over cooked. my guest had the cod which was a highlight dish perfect sear and todiefor white bean 'cassoulet' really the best dish of the evening . desert was an over the top blondie topped with carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream whip, carmel cookie crumble, walnut, mint leaf . it was good, rich as hell, but not great. the wine selection expensive but expansive. service was good and i know how hard they are working . dinner was overall amazing just the classics, respected and not pretentious. yeah so what i'm local. born and raised, and we really enjoyed sneaking into a 'touristy' place that does not get so many locals. gm was on his toes seating guests, hustling! you would be hard pressed to find a better fish dish then the cod, anywhere. fog harbor is my new favorite fish house in the bay!"
411,Kai L.,1119,5,9/23/18,"packed out on sunday but fortunately had nice water view seats! you can ask server to borrow portable charger if you need to juice up your phone. tried their lobster tails , clams, shrimp ."
412,Elizabeth G.,1119,2,8/16/18,"disappointing experience. positives friendly bartender, friendly waitress, great view, clean and spacious. these things are what earned stars. the other were lost due to the attitude of the hostesses and the poor quality of the food. we ordered the crab chicken cocktail and the lobster tails . the crab had no flavor and the lobster tasted like it had been microwaved. i am not sure if i would come back unless it was for a work party or something."
413,Danielle M.,1119,1,7/29/18,"unfortunately this star review is due to the fact that i got violently sick, after eating here last night. we had clam chowder and the shellfish platter for two with lobster tails . after taxes and tip we spent aout . it is unfortunate and unacceptable to get sick at a restaurant as expensive and well established as this. i have reached out to the establishment regarding my experience."
414,Iris R.,1119,4,6/23/18,"i made the conscious decision to eat at fog harbor fish house with my kids in our first visit to san francisco. there was no line but the place had lots of diners. although we were not given the window table, it was still a very nice experience to be guided to your table by affable attendants. my kids ordered their salmon children's meal and they had a great time waiting for their meal because of the crayons and the coloring papers. for myself, i splurged on lobster tails and crab cakes to share. i had anchor beer to wash it down. the lobster was fresh and just juicy. it was yummy! and the crab cakes! the kids really enjoyed their salmon and they said that it was the best they ever had! we did not wait that long for the food and we also did not dally long inside the restaurant. it was a splurge worth having!"
415,Elain C.,1119,5,4/6/18,"our second time to visit this great restaurant.it is located on the second level of pier . coming here with friends from outside california is a great treat. after showing them the famous fisherman's wharf, sealions and alcatraz. we make it a point that this would be the last stop of our tour of pier . we sat exactly on the same round table by the entrance. my family and guest were delighted to have bernie same server as my son vividly remembers him as suggested we had the platter for and added lobster tails . guest got mix grill and ahi .it s a must for my guest to try their famous chowder.they loved it. service was impeccable from the host to bernie's constant attendening to what my guest needs.clean bathroom. i would surely would come back in this restaurant if i have guest ."
416,Jackie Q.,1119,4,3/23/18,"loved my experience here! everything was fantastic, the restaurant has an upscale feel, and the wait was not too bad cuz good luck trying to get a sameday reservation . our waiter was sassy, but professional, and honestly the only complaint i have was the fact that the oysters were extremely small and had a rather dull taste. i had the lobster tails and if i ever had the heart to spend on one meal again, i would definitely reorder. had the apple crumble for dessert, it was on point! came with my family and we ended up spending a bit more than total, but it was well spent. i would definitely recommend for seafood lovers, but just a tip do not get the oysters. they are rather unappealing."
417,George B.,1119,5,3/11/18,excellent service and food. my kids had lobster tails and garlic roasted whole crab. my wife had penne chicken and i had combo grill. super tasty and server was very polite and professional. we will be back for sure.
418,Tim P.,1119,5,3/2/18,"food here was great and very reasomably priced for how much food we got. our waiter justin got us started off quick and we loved the friendly service tonight. we started with the fried calamari which was fantastic and got the lobster tails and shellfiah platter. food, service, and atmosphere was on point. definitely coming here again"
419,Kristel V.,1119,5,1/21/18,"if you want fresh seafood, you better come here! was here for a weekend with friends and since we were in sf, we wanted seafood! we were seated by the window and had a nice view of the bay. some of us decided to order the shellfish platter good for people + lobster tails . i thought it would not be enough for me, so i ended up ordering the crab louie salad as well. omg, when the food came out, i was overwhelmed. the shellfish platter and my salad was huge! everything tasted so good though. shellfish platter was cooked with butter and tons of garlic. seafood was fresh and it was worth the price we paid. definitely coming back and ordering maybe just the shellfish platter next time. our waiter was as very nice as well. will be back!"
420,Adrian A.,1119,5,1/6/18,"after a second visit today, fog harbor fish house is now firmly on my list of seafood restaurants to go to when in sf. its location on pier might initially be a turnoff if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and do not relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. however, the food is worth it. luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. i would describe the interior of the restaurant as modern . the seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which i think was for walkins. large windows facing the moorings for the blue & gold tour boats let us lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables. the menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some nonseafood choices. as i understand it, fog harbor is part of the simmons family restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around pier . one thing to bear in mind is that this is the more proper of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result. you will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. on both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino seafood stew , the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. the seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. the main courses i ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. both dishes were phenomenal. one thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which i made a note of on my reservation, and our server kayla gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it! it was the tiramisu, which is definitely worth saving space for. in short, i am already looking forward to my next visit to fog harbor!"
421,James M.,1119,5,11/12/17,best fish restaurant on pier ! the ahi was to die for! the lobster tails were meaty not tiny little tails . the bread was to die for and the service was impeccable. i will say the lady in the front shirt with black hair was not all that nice but i can understand dealing with tourist all day can be tough! will come back next year! keep up the good work!
422,Brittany M.,1119,5,10/18/17,"this place is yummy! ordered a bowl of clam chowder and it was prob the best i've ever had. i also had the mussels fries and the fries are crisp! mussels are fresh, too. for my entree, i ordered the lobster tails which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. lobster tail was perfect and the mashed potatoes were creamy. service was great. our waitress was friendly and attentive. i would recommend this place for a great view of the bay & alcatraz."
423,Joseph L.,1119,2,9/28/17,"reserved for dinner about a month in advance for a special occasion for . i requested for a less busier window seating upon arrival. host had a bad attitude and told us to wait until she calls us. we should have walked away then. host sat us by the bar and very close to entrance of the building. we saw many tables available inside the room so we asked the host for another table further inside with less distractions. when we politely flagged the host as she passed by to request for another table, she spoke to us in a condescending manner and told us to figure it out with the server. their solution to our request was to move our table to a booth about feet away. another chance to just walk out but i did not want to spoil the occasion. we ordered crab cakes, dozen oysters, ciopinni with pasta, seafood platter for with lobster tails . the hospitality here does not match the price. we selected this restaurant because it was suppose to have a nice view and ambiance. we spent about for . i recommend spending your money where they appreciate your business."
424,Becca S.,1119,5,9/28/17,"amazing seafood spot! my dad was visiting my my fiance and i from hawai'i he knows seafood . our server alex i believe, was awesome and very helpful when it came down to deciding on what the heck we were going to get. he recommend the seafood platter, which has mussels, clams, crab and shrimp. my fiance got the shareable size for him and i. my dad and i each got the lobster tails . my fiance and i split my dish and the platter and it was sooooo much food! the shareable seafood platter is honestly good enough to share between people. if you get some appetizers and with all the bread they give you it is definitely a good way to all get down and chow down. the view is amazing and i will definitely be back again!"
425,Alex R.,1119,4,9/6/17,"good the food is very good. we had the bay scallops, mixed grill, and lobster tails all of it was tender, juicy and seasoned well. portions are not huge, but they are certainly big enough you will not leave unsatisfied. service is top notch. the server raphael made several good recommendations and was very sociable. he was attentive without being intrusive. ambiance. has a nice view of bay and the bridge and the decor is upscale without being gaudy. definitely had a great vibe to it. bad feels roughly % overpriced. definitely great for special occasions, but the prices mean this will probably not be a weekly event."
426,Aaron E.,1119,3,7/2/17,"had the oz lobster tails and the wife had the fried combo calamari, octopi, fish and shrimp with fries. the lobster was good but tough on top with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed squash. over all it was a good dish. wife's plate was meh. fish was gross. calamari and octopus was good and shrimp was ok. the star on that dish was the fench fries sad enough. came out to . meh"
427,P M.,1119,2,6/19/17,"one star for ambiance, one star for location. service was good but not great. food was mediocre. more than a couple dishes were dirty. drinks cognac neat, seemed like way less than a shot, more like . of an ounce starters shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail dinner lobster tails x . the lobster was either old and soggy or undercooked. absolutely unacceptable. mixed grill this meal was average. if the mashed potatoes were executed better i would have been ok with the meal. dungenous crab ravioli this was the best thing we ordered burger execution on special requests were not met bacon on side not in burger, mayo requested not served kind of dry but decent quality meat. dessert blondie highlight of the night, very rich."
428,Donna G.,1119,2,6/11/17,"disappointed! ate here last night. server justin said he was new to the restaurant so perhaps that explains the slow service and cold food. i ordered the lobster tails , chowder and a cocktail. waited nearly an hour for my entree, which was cold and bland when it arrived. had to ask for water twice before he brought it. noticed that the girls at the table next to us were served quickly and he spent a good deal.of time chatting with them and encouraging them to rate his service. not sure if they did, but i sure am! justin, as a former waitress i left you a bad tip, it takes a lot to get a bad tip from me. hope you learn quickly before you run off more customers like me, a bit older with money to spend. when i told you my food was cold you said sorry, took the plate away and that was it. when we were waiting nearly an hour for our food, you never once came to try table to reassure us that it was on the way. i will not be back."
429,Mr B.,1119,5,6/2/17,"amazing food and service. the sour dough bread was fresh, hot, and the best i have ever had. we had the spicy shrimp appetizer, the grill mix, and the lobster tails . i have never had such well cooked seafood. the whole experience was awesome and made one of the top things we did while in ca. thanks!"
430,Rashi T.,1119,4,10/19/18,"every time i have been to sfo , this is one place we always visited because someone in our party always ends up picking it based on the great reviews . honestly it does not disappoint either. the seafood is good , the service is fast and the views . ahh the views , well that is the first thing that catches your fancy. we had a nice spot near the window , especially with the sunlight filtering in . i would highly recommend the clam chowder , its pretty darn good . we proceeded to order a variety of dishes blue cheese garlic breads, crab cakes , ahi tuna poke, red chili garlic shrimp and the crab . the crab cakes were so soft and succulent , i wished they would never end ! our server recommended the hibiscus margarita , which i think was not that liked by either of us , it was way too sugary ."
431,Mai N.,1119,3,10/13/18,long wait but the food was not that great. average quality yet pricey. i ordered seafood pasta and ahi tuna rare seared which came out just ok. for both exluded drinks.
432,Eleonor T.,1119,5,10/9/18,"came here for my mother's th birthday. the food was absolutely fabulous. we ordered the fish and chips, whole crab, linguini w clams, surf and turf, scallops w polenta, chopino,calamari, baked oysters, ahi tuna , and of course the clam chowder. everything was delicious. the view was gorgeous and the staff was very friendly. will totally come back."
433,Johnny L.,1119,5,9/16/18,"really good food here! love the crab and scallop risotto and the ahi tuna that we ordered. the only the i would suggest it is about the ac, could be a bit colder. sometimes, when the room got too crowded, it could be really steaming. but food is good tho."
434,Timothy Z.,1119,5,9/3/18,"the food was absolutely amazing!! the staff was awesome as well!! our waiter curtiss was so knowledgeable about the menu and what they had to offer. we thought we would give this place a try and we were so glad we did. i had the ahi tuna , and my wife had the jambalaya, it was so so good!!! even my daughter who is a very picky eater ate all her dinner, it was great. great portion sizes and the wait was very very quick. we will be back every time we head to san francisco, thanks again for the awesome hospitality and we look forward to next time."
435,Kasey L.,1119,4,8/26/18,"the food here is very good! however for the price point the service was disappointing. we came at a time that was not busy either around pm so really disappointed in the service. we got the calamari, fish and chips as well as the ahi tuna . all were excellent!"
436,Vanita M.,1119,5,8/15/18,"my daughter and i were looking for a place for get a snack. sf has so many awesome food choices we did not want to fill up too much at any one place. it was a friday at or so and we were seated pretty quickly. we ordered appetizers. the crab cakes, which the server told us was different than other restaurants and some sort of ahi tuna dish pictured both were delicious and not too filling. the server was really nice even though we did not order alcohol. i've experienced many occasions when the server seems annoyed the atmosphere is wonderful as is the view."
437,Mike N.,1119,1,8/4/18,"the restaurant has great ambience while still in the prime location of pier . however today i was deeply disappointed with their service. we had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. we had the award winning clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna . the clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. the crab cakes were good as well. i liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. but the service here, was just terrible. our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. we had to ask for everything, straws, etc . our table was never cleared at anytime either. all of our plates were just sitting on the table. i was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. the oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. the ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. after paying + dollars is this what i should expect by all means i have no issue spending money on food. but it really just hits a nerve when i get crappy service and i'm paying for it. i would go else where if your thinking about the fog harbor fish house."
438,Sandy B.,1119,5,8/4/18,"this is my favorite restaurant! i took my husband for our th year anniversary. the service was way beyond our expectations. curtis and ashley both made it a memorable meal for both my husband and i. the food was superb we had the ahi tuna appetizer, and we split the pacific sole, and tiramisu on the house for our anniversary which was so sweet. we look forward to coming again hopefully in the near future. thank you!!"
439,Ella H.,1119,4,7/30/18,"we have visited once a year, years running. the chowder is superb, except for the bacon they put in this fish dish. aka please stop get the extra crab on top you will not regret it. the seared ahi tuna melts in your mouth. grab a bottle of kunde sauvignon blanc it will enhance any meal. the wait staff is typically very accommodating, timely, and personable which only adds to this great experience. hostesses are apparently stressed due to their curt responses. would have been stars but for the hostesses & disgusting restroom that smelled like it had not been cleaned in hot years the rr not the hostess do not forget to get the hour validation ticket from your server! bon appetit!"
440,Cath C.,1119,5,7/8/18,"great service! we waited mins for a window seating! great view of the waterfront! our waiter had great suggestion off their menu! order scallop and crab meat risotto summer menu, not sure if its available year round , ahi tuna poke, clam chowder sourdough bowl! clam chower was super creamy with lots of ingredients, the sourdough bowl was warm unlike other places near fisherman's wharf that serves the bowl cold! risotto was delicious, did not overpower the crab meat at all!"
441,Frank D.,1119,5,6/16/18,the seafood was very fresh and well prepared. the ahi tuna was very flavorful. justin was our waiter and he did a great job taking care of us. we will definitely ask for him next time.
442,Jax W.,1119,4,6/16/18,by far the best thing i've had since being in san fran. got the ahi tuna steak and it made my taste buds jump! it truly just melted in my mouth. i can not wait to return one day to have this again. the mix drinks were fair. the atmosphere seemed like it was trying to be a bit classier but there was a lot more casual feel to it. overall service was decent. the view if you get seated well is enjoyable.
443,Sarah M.,1119,5,6/4/18,"i am horrified that i forgot our waitress's name, as she was just the sweetest and most patient woman and everything you could ever hope for with your dining experience . i literally told her, thank you for being so wonderful at the end of the night. we went around pm with no reservations on a tuesday night, and were still given a table overlooking the water. our waitress was super sweet and answered our , questions about the menu. we felt welcome, respected, and free to explore the menu. most importantly, the food was amazing!!! locally sourced and perfect. the blue cheese bread appetizer was fantastic, and the ahi tuna was firm yet melted in your mouth, and the halibut was just phenomenal. best meal i have probably ever had in my life. thank you all so much! it was a special night for us, and you made it perfect!!"
444,Warren S.,1119,5,5/30/18,"this is the first seafood spot i've been to in san francisco and they set the bar high! starters, the location is gorgeous. overlooking the bay, great lighting, and easy to get to. the service was friendly, gave great suggestions, and seemed genuine with their guests. i did not partake in the drinks or desert but from what i saw they looked great as well. now, the food. the food was amazing! potentially the best calamari i have ever had pictures included and the ahi tuna with mixed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes was cooked to perfection. i work without question recommend this to others as well as be a returning customer in my future endeavors in san francisco!"
445,Michelle S.,1119,5,5/7/18,"ordered the ahi tuna poke appetizer, lettuce wedge, and crab cocktail. the first two were superbly done, very flavorful. i could have done without the crab i thought it would be lump meat but it was sort of in shreds. do not miss the complimentary warm sourdough bread with butter! so good!! also had the mojito to drink and it was exquisite. of course it all was pricey but that seems to be the way of san francisco. bon appetit!"
446,Meghan P.,1119,5,4/10/18,"wow!!! this restaurant is amazing. i was out in the city with a good friend and she recommended we go to this restaurant for lunch. i was not disappointed. they served warm fresh sourdough bread while waiting for our entrees. the butter was perfectly salted and room temperature which i love. i ordered the half soup salad. i got the cesar salad with clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. it was more than filling i was not able to finish it all. good thing i had my husband there to help me out. my husband ordered the ahi tuna entree which he let me have a little of. the ahi tuna was seared and coated with sesame seeds but rare on the inside. it had great flavor and melted in your mouth. it was served with rice with an amazing soy lime sauce that had a yummy smoky flavor. it was also served with vegetables. my friend got the mixed grill which came with salmon, cod and shrimp along with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. we all left very full and satisfied. this restaurant has tons of yummy seafood options. i cannot wait to come back to this restaurant and test out the other entrees."
447,Michelle H.,1119,5,3/29/18,"amazing food!!! the clam chowder was one of the best i have had and i am from ma . bf had the filet, it was so tender and had so much flavor with the mushroom sauce topped with crumbled blue cheese. i had the ahi tuna , seared to perfection, with a wasabi aioli. definitely recommend if in the san fran area."
448,Michelle H.,1119,5,1/5/18,i highly recommend coming here at opening. you will have a higher chance of getting a window seat and getting a great view of the harbor and the pier. the ahi tuna was delicious and grilled shrimp entree. the restaurant also serves complimentary warm sourdough bread. they also serve delicious freshly squeezed orange juice and lemonade. they also have a great selection of desserts. the service was also amazing. the restaurant is clean and romantic.
449,Jennie N.,1119,5,12/30/17,"i usually void fisherman's wharf especially around the holidaysgetting run over by strollers and pedestrians just are not my thang but i was in a rather cheery mood and decided to take in the christmas decorations before they get torn down. we decided to have dinner at fog harbor fish house thanks to yelp reviews and they did not disappoint. for starters, we had the calamari, red chili garlic shrimp and mussel fries. all were quite tasty, particularly the garlic shrimp. that sauce had the right amount of spice and kick. we followed with their award winning clam chowder in a bread bowlthick and creamy with plenty of clam chunks. just yums! for the main course, we ordered the cioppino, ahi tuna and seafood penne. my little tot had the chicken tenders. all are highly recommended including the tendersvery meaty and well.tender. everything was great but what really brought this review from a star experience to is our waiter, justin. he was accommodating and made sure our dinner experience was an unforgettable one. we were all pleasantly surprised by justin's attentiveness, how fresh the food was and our overall experience considering the restaurant is in a tourist trap. if you are in the area and do not mind the wait and the crowds, fog harbor is worth the visit."
450,Lindsay C.,1119,4,10/20/18,"seafood party! love that you get on the wait list via yelp and avoid waiting around uncessarily. the clam chowder here was so amazing! it was creamy with pieces of clams and potato and i wanted to lick the bowl. scallop, crab, and clam risotto was pretty tasty at first bite but once i had a bite of the seafood penne pasta it was like move over risotto. red sauce better than white sauce ftw. the seafood on the penne pasta was cooked to perfection and i found myself dipping into this dish more than my own. the risotto i thought needed to be cooked more. it was not as creamy as i prefer risotto to be. it was still good but i would get the penne pasta next time. the tiramisu was delish. it was a bit more chocolatey but still light with hints of expresso. service was great and i could see myself coming back for more clam chowder."
451,Danielle P.,1119,5,10/5/18,"i spent the weekend in sf with my mom and her one request was that she have scallops for dinner, her fav! after some yelping around, i chose fog harbor and made a reservation online. located on the nd floor of the pier strip, you get a pretty awesome view, day or night. we requested a seat by the window and were accommodated with no problem. the service was good and the food was great. we started with the shrimp cocktail, i highly recommend. my mom had the special crab risotto with scallops, she loved this dish. everything was perfectly cooked. i went with the seafood penne , also so good! the dish was packed full of clams, mussels, crab, shrimp, scallops.too much for me to eat on my own even though i tried so hard overall the view of the water along with a great meal was a perfect ending to our night."
452,Dan S.,1119,3,9/20/18,the best part about this place was the bread before the meal. my girlfriend got the garlic shrimp. i hate when places burn shrimp on the skewer to a crisp. their mashed potatoes were literally nothing more than mashed. potatoes. no salt or butter just bland the sauteed spinach if they were sauteed at all was only in the pan for a couple seconds. when i told the waiter he said that is the way they saute it. im sorry man the way you do it is wrong. i had the seafood penne it was just alright nothing special to be over dollars. someone tell me how this place is stars because to me it is overrated. i do not know if it was star bad but it was not good.
453,Cynthia D.,1119,4,9/15/18,"amazing spot for great food with view of alcatraz and the pier. my party of four enjoyed our seafood dinner here and the sunset view was gorgeous. for appetizer, i tried the clam chowder in the bread bowl which was really creamy and tasty, fresh oysters freakin' delicious, and even the baked oysters were noteworthy, and the crab cakes were to die for! for entrees, we got the seasonal jumbo scallop and crab meat risotto and the seafood penne . both were solid dishes! i loved the crab flavor in the risotto. infamous restaurant in fisherman's wharf whereas the wait can be for hours. luckily for us, yelp waitlist was the mvp! i wish more restaurants implement this in nyc. i simply opened my handy yelp app and tapped to join the waitlist must be within miles while i was commuting from my hotel in lower haight. it would give me an estimated time to check in with the hostess and approximately how many parties are ahead of us. my friends and i were exploring fisherman's wharf the entire time until time got closer. ta da!"
454,Eliza I.,1119,5,9/10/18,"best restaurant in fisherman's wharf! delicious food with excellent services. calamari was fried to perfection, flavorful creamy seafood penne and yummy creme brulee. truly enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come again in next trip!"
455,Carinna L.,1119,2,9/10/18,"we were excited to try out this local joint as seattle locals visiting from out of town. for the price, location, and food selection we had decent expectations. we started with alcoholic beverages which were decent, but did not taste like much alcohol was in them. we ordered appetizers of calamari and clam chowder which was quite delicious. no complaints there. however, our entrees came out and that is when our experience took a nosedive. the table ordered the recommended dishes such as the seafood penne and the fish and chips. the battered fish was bland and tasteless, and the seafood penne pasta left more to be desired. the sauce was so thin it slid right off the pasta leaving a plain noodle. the service was awful, and i'm pretty sure the server was high the entire time. i expected a lot more from a nicer restaurant and wish we had chosen a different place."
456,Charity M.,1119,5,9/4/18,"i am never the one to write reviews, but fog harbor left me no choice! i had the clam chowder, & i can see why it is award winning! i also had the seafood penne sublinguine it was amazing! i do not eat cilantro, & they had no problem making me a new dish without cilantro! our server ashley was nothing short of amazing. ashley's customer service was the best i've had in a long time! i am huge on customer service. my experience overall was dope! i will be back really soon!"
457,Jes S.,1119,5,9/2/18,"located in pier , this restaurant is definitely worth waiting in line for. tip luckily you can join the waitlist via yelp , to cut your waiting time shorter! i had the seafood penne with generous portions of fish, mussels, clams, and shrimp and also tried the dungenous crab, clam chowder and the calamari all of which tasted divine! highly recommend the clam chowder!"
458,AnnMarie J.,1119,5,8/17/18,ordered the seafood penne and the risotto and both were spectacular. make reservations two days or more in advanced if possible. love this place and will be back!
459,Sheila E.,1119,5,8/17/18,"had the seafood penne and the sole. both were very good. the penne was very flavorful and the sole was refreshing. i would order either of them again, although i would want to try the ahi next. i love that you can put yourself on the waitlist via yelp so we could wander around. our friend had their dog from site seeing all day and was glad that the restaurant could still accommodate us."
460,Neda A.,1119,5,5/27/18,"this place is great! the clam chowder was so creamy and like none other. the calamari as well as the seafood penne was delightful. finally, justine our server was extremely attentive and friendly. i would highly recommend this place!"
461,Fanny S.,1119,5,5/14/18,"this was the best thing that i had on my san francisco trip! the food was delicious, and the service was great! we ordered the shellfish platter with a lobster, the seafood penne , which were all delicious, but the show stopper was the scallops and crab risotto. that was so delicious! there are four scallops that are beautifully cooked, and they were seasoned perfectly. the risotto itself was great, but i feel like it could have had a bit more flavor. if you can go, definitely go, and try those things listed above, especially the crab risotto. you can enjoy the view while having a delicious meal!"
462,Babs L.,1119,5,5/8/18,"amazing place! my two girls had salmon and i had the seafood penne . omg, so amazing! calamari appetizer is a must. my yo had the kids fish and chips and we took one bite and that was it. dry and bland so do not bother with wasting on kids meal. the bread. oh the bread. dreaming about it still."
463,Scott L.,1119,5,4/19/18,"when every place on a monday night is dead in the harbor area, but fog harbor fish house is bumpin then yeah you know this place is awesome. i would recommend making a reservation no matter the night as this place is right on the water and the food service is amazing. clam chowder lives up to the hype and i made the rookie mistake of not getting it in the bread bowl. they have great bread that they give you before the meal. any place that gives me breads always has a special place in my heart. i ordered the seafood penne which was bomb and very reasonably priced. the service is excellent and it feels like seconds after you order, the food is at the table. if i come back to san francisco, i will make sure to eat here again as it was the best restaurant i went to during my trip."
464,Joseph V.,1119,5,4/14/18,"excellent food, good atmosphere, justin made it very nice. we liked the seafood penne and the shrimp brochette. both excellent."
465,Natasha R.,1119,5,2/28/18,"while the hubs and i are on our way to our goto spot to get our crab craving fix, on a whim we decided to try some place new, and boy i do not regret that decision one bit! we agreed on fog harbor fish house based on their yelp reviews thank you, fellow yelpians . we started with the calamari. mouth.watering. it is the jalapenos, i swear! and to top it off with the lemon aioli. i died, inside. happily. the shellfish platter is a must! the hubs is a big guy, so the platter for two plus the lobster was filling for him. i feel as though if he were to have bought it for , he would be asking for a snickers bar drumroll, with a hit of the symbols bam . shellfish platter for two came with whole crab, clams, shrimp and mussels. we added a lobster for an additional cost. the seafood penne was satisfying. not as much flavor as i wished for, but i guess it is expected when you have a variety of seafood in a pasta i'm assuming they were trying to put an emphasis in the seafood , rather than seasoning it up and hiding the seafood's natural flavor. and i am not mad at that. and to end our beautiful experience almost cried because desserts are always a reminder that you are almost done i could not help, but salivate over their apple crisp. lord, help me. just screw this review and go and get yourself a seat at this place."
466,Tori G.,1119,5,2/25/18,"the food here is so good and the seafood is so fresh! i ordered the seafood penne and my mother ordered a crab sandwich and both meals were delicious. the sauce they used in my pasta was outstanding, i could not get enough of it and the chicken, mussels, and other seafood i found inside my pasta was fantastic. in fact it was my first time ever trying mussels, and this restaurant has me hooked. unfortunately i have not experienced any other restaurant that matches the yumminess of this one though! there is plenty of seating and did not have to witness any wait. the waiter was very nice and quick to serve us. the view and ambiance was also really quite wonderful. parking could be a problem for some people, yet if you are familiar with san francisco you should know public transportation or walking is really the most viable way to get around. i'm so excited to eat here again"
467,R A.,1119,4,2/23/18,"the food was fantastic and the view was great. we arrived for an early dinner. i knocked one star off since our first server was passing out water and reached across the table and said to my mother take the glass, honey. not only is that condescending but it is a sign of an improperly trained server as you should never hand something to a patron. the shift was changing so luckily that server was replaced with someone more professional. cocktails, appetizers, entrees and dessert.no complaints! some standouts were the crab cakes, bleu cheese garlic bread not overwhelmingly bleu definitely try , mixed seafood penne and special entrees. take a peek at the oldschool dessert tray and you will not be able to resist!"
468,Sussie C.,1119,5,2/15/18,excellent! had the seafood penne mixed grill fried calamari red chili garlic shrimp all amazing! highly recommend!
469,Sean M.,1119,5,2/12/18,we had a meal for our yr anniversary. the seafood penne and bread bowl clam chowder were excellent picks. they even gave us a complimentary dessert.
470,Karen A.,1126,5,11/5/18,"ummm can i just saw amazing! from beginning to end i loved the whole experience. i had a last minute trip to chicago and the only reservation available was at pm. i kept it because i heard great things but i went in around pm just to see if i could get seated maybe at the bar but they actually had a table! the waiter gave me great recommendations and was even able to half size the portions for me so i was able to have multiple dishes! i started with the wood grilled broccoli which, then got the seared scallops, bucatini and ended with caramel corn & vanilla malt balls. my favorite of them all was the seared scallop. the bucatinibis my second fave with milked pork shoulder in tomato sauce. everything was great and i would definitely come here again!"
471,Mike H.,1126,4,11/7/18,"if there is one restaurant to try in chicago, chef izard's girl and the goat ought to be it. the food is rustic and combines fusion elements from all over the world. those influences from mexico, southeast asia, china, and europe struck me the most. to start things off, their cocktails are must tries. it is always in oaxaca, a citrusinfused mezcal drink brimmed with salt and chili powder, really hit the spot and gave the drink a pleasant kick. the lamb ribs were our favorite. smothered in a combination of house bbq and a sweet and tangy berry reduction, the meat was both tender and savory. other highlights included the wood fired octopus and roasted cauliflower. the inspiration for the octopus, sitting on top a layer of mole and pickled squash, hinted mexican and definitely surprised us in a very pleasant way. for the cauliflower, absolutely addictive, i simply could not stop eating it. the waitress also recommended goat empanadas, pig face and duck tongue, both are their signature dishes as well as their desserts. honestly, i was not impressed by them and thought they were bland and quite forgettable compared to the bolder flavors of the other dishes. my verdict definitely worth a try for the uninitiated as the chef has certainly introduced new, exciting flavors to my palate and their cocktails are simply amazing. however, at this price point, i would be slightly hesitant to return again."
472,Mary M.,1126,5,11/5/18,"yum! this place is often packed  worth the wait as you can grab a glass of wine and enjoy the city atmosphere of good people enjoying great tastes. it is an opportune time to check out what others are ordering and savor the good service. even on a busy night the staff are sure to notice and at least let you know what your wait might be if you are a walk in. reservations are recommended, even if you call on the way you are likely to move up in the line quicker. things take time to come out yes, however it is a more relaxed way of enjoying the company you are with over a glass of wine before you dine. if you are in a rush for a meal and want service right after you order maybe it is not the spot for you... every place is different  if you are in a rush just stop in for wine and an appetizer at the bar, worth the visit at least once! for us we will be back!"
473,Cindy Z.,1126,4,11/5/18,"book your reservations at least a month in advance if you want to come eat here! even so, it was difficult to get a good time. i ended up getting an pm reservation on a monday night for three. upon arrival, we were seated immediately though. between the three of us, we shared six dishes hamachi crudo , roasted cauliflower , wood fired octopus , wood fired whole branzino , grilled beef short ribs , and wood fired lamb ribs . their portions are on the smaller side and they bring out your dishes one by one from lightest to heaviest. simply said, the crudo was light and refreshing to start. since you always need some veggies, the cauliflower was a nice addition mixed in with a sour flavor from the pickled peppers. the octopus and branzino were flavorful with a smokey, roasted flavor. now my favorites were the last two, shorts ribs and lamb ribs. i am just a huge meat lover, so these dishes were amazing. the short ribs were similar to when you get kalbi at a korean restaurant, but the pairing of the apple salad was a good contrast. as for the lamb ribs, they were incredibly tender. it fell off the bone so easily that you had to lift the piece of meat onto your plate. the glaze on this was smooth and truly wrapped flavor all over the meat with no dry parts. this was definitely my favorite pick and only wished there were more than just  pieces of ribs. girl and the goat is one of those place you just need to check out at least once. the menu provides and array of dishes done in a creative manner. although nothing completely wowed me, it was still a great meal and a chance to say you have been here."
474,Kevin C.,1126,4,11/2/18,"great spot in chicago accessible by the elevated train. it is a tough seat to get but if you arrive at opening at  pm it is quite easy to sit at the bar and get the same menu as at the tables. service was great. explanation of everything on the menu and on any of our questions. they offer up daily specials as well. highlights for me was the pig face entree. perfectly porky fried up on a flat plate with a runny egg that was perfectly cooked. the pork was flavorful with the right amount of collagen and protein coming through. the scallop dish was also wonderful. fresh scallops that matched up well with the rest of the dish. even the dessert was very creative with it is popcorn, marshmellow, and milk ice cream that satisfied at the end. highly recommend."
475,Delia S.,1126,5,11/2/18,"where to begin? i was bummed to learn that alinea only has one single top reservation available on any given day and i did not get it. i was lamenting this policy to a friend and former chicagoan when she said, get a reservation at girl and the goat. i had never heard of this place. i made a reservation two months ahead of my trip and, long story short, by coincidence, so did she. we ended up adding me on to her party of five and that was fortuitous, because it allowed me to try nearly every item on the menu! the bad news for you, dear reader, is that i did not take pics of anything. i just enjoyed the experience, and what an experience it was! this was culinary mastery! some highlights the hamachi crudo. the textural play of butter soft hamachi, crisp puffed black rice and spicy vinaigrette was magic on the tongue. we had two of these. the oysters shigoku oysters with a ponzu mignonette. again combining flavors of light brine, creamy oyster, spicy citrus mignonette. devine. we had two orders. chickpea fritter chaat crisp outer she will, creamiest of creamy interiors, amazing flavor! again, we ordered a second round. the spiced shrimp honestly, my favorite part was the tempura delicata squash, but overall the dish was amazing. and the overall favorite the braised beef tongue. i am of mexican american descent, so i have had beef tongue multiple times. this was next level! thankfully, everyone at the table was adventurous and willing to try and every person there felt this was the winning dish. the slices of beef were so incredibly tender and well flavored and the crisp masa chips and tangy salsa verde just highlighted how special this dish was. we tried many other items, too many to list. everything was delicious. i would go back every day if i could. the overall bill was also a surprise. i would have thought it would have been much more. it was  for six adults, including two bottles of wine and three cocktails. we are like kings!"
476,Jennifer L.,1126,3,10/31/18,"is the staff good? yes ish. is it constantly busy? yes def. is the food good? yes ish. so why the three stars? well, with all the hype girl & the goat gets, it simply was not spectacular in any sense. in fact, my airbnb host told me to cancel my reservation when he heard i snagged a seat here. to my regret, i did not. as soon as we were seated, we were promptly neglected. our waitress was running around trying to get to all her tables, and we were awkwardly seated right behind the hostess desk. i literally had to wave down another waiter to get our waitresses attention. after that snafu, however, she constantly checked in on us. provided an app on the house when our food took extra long. def made up for it. the food, however, never really made up for the wait. if i need to wait mins for the branzino, my hope is that it is going to be amazinggggg. but it was not. and our two veggie bowls came out before our entrees. so much earlier than our entrees, that we literally finished all the veggies before any of our protein arrived. it was disappointing in terms of how the food arrived. probably should have listened to my airbnb host. most likely would not return.  stars."
477,Cuc N.,1126,5,10/30/18,"i had to book  months in advance for the girl & the goat, and even then, the earliest dinner reservation i could get was pm for a monday evening on opentable. that is how crazy people book in advance! i did not even know what i signed up for or even thought to comprehend that i would be eating goat meat here. all i knew was, if i were to go to chicago, i must go to the girl & the goat. that is what everyone said. and they were right. i did not regret it one bit. but note if you want to eat goat leg or goat shoulder, you must call and preorder one day in advance. the goat shoulder is lb with a lb minimum purchase. the goat leg was even larger.... we did not preorder because lb for  people was way too much food! however, there are other goat dishes that you can still order!!! rory mcilroy. broker'sÄã gin . lychee . pink peppercorn . black tea . lemon. this cocktail was one of the most refreshing, light and caffeinated cocktails i have ever had. i love the contrast of the tea and lychee and lemon yet the butter and sweet and sour flavors blended together so nicely. goat liver mousse. berry lamb jam . cranberry mostarda . bread & butter pickles. i really love this dish even though i feel like i might already be biased because i love pate and this is similar to pate in concept. the mousse was very light and soft yet rich in goat liver flavor. i enjoyed spreading the mousse on the bread. the contrast with the pickled sauces was a palate cleanser. hamachi crudo. chilisoy vinaigrette . finger hots . gooseberries . puffed black rice. this was everyone's favorite dish all around. i actually have never had good hamachi crudo before. the fish would always be so tough to chew. but these were as tender and soft and smooth as can be wood oven roasted pig face. sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red winemaple . potato stix. hmm, i think this was my favorite!!! i just enjoyed eating the meat so much!! there was such good flavor in this dish. i think it is also the tamarind. crisp braised pork shank. buttermilk dressing . butternut squash kimchi . naan. wait!! i think this was my favorite too!!!! the pork shank was huge. the meat flakes off from the bones so easy. ugh. so. delicious. bucatini. milk braised pork shoulder . tomato. hmm, i think this was also my favorite!!!! the pasta was very soft and chewy. the light tomato sauce was milky and creamy from the milk braised. the pork was soooo tender! caramel corn & malt balls. vanilla malt ice cream . popcorn caramel . chocolate magic she will. and now let us end it with some birthday dessert with one of their famous desserts! i love the playful popcorn and chocolate and ice cream and caramel altogether! pros very friendly attentive service dim ambience with perfect environment for a date or a group huge restaurant, a lot of seating delicious food goat! plenty of other restaurants and bars around to hop to afterwards cons there are none! tip you can book on open table  months in advance"
478,Bailey Z.,1126,5,10/24/18,"ever since i watched top chef more than  years ago, i have had this spot bookmarked on my yelp page. it is been sitting in the to try section until now. i have finally crossed this one off the bucket list, and with all the expectations that had built up over the years, i have to say that it exceeded mine. the menu is set up to be shared familystyle and we enjoyed picking a bunch of plates to share. the style seemed to be a modern twist on comfort food, which is something we enjoy. we ordered a couple of vegetable dishes including the sauteed green beans  and the roasted cauliflower . for something so simple like greenbeans and cauliflower, our tastebuds were blown away from the getgo. the green beans had a great fish sauce vinaigrette and the cashews gave it an asianinspired flavor. the cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mints all blended well together. who would have thought that mint would go well with cauliflower? and unlike most cauliflower dishes, this one did not stink maybe the mint helped?! for our fish dish, we got the seared scallops  with wild maitake and wood ears, oyster sauce brodo, and squash brandade. very well seared and flavorful. as the name implied, we had to get a couple of goat dishes and went with the goat empanadas  and the confit goat belly . we loved the flavor of the goat in the empanadas as it was not too gamey or heavy. the miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco, brightened up the dish. the confit goat belly was probably my least favorite dish because it was so heavy with the bourbon butter, which coated all of the goat belly, lobster, crab, and fennel. a couple pork dishes stood out with the wood oven roasted pig face  as well as the mustorder crisp braised pork shank . i thought these were two of the best plates. the pig face had a perfect sunny side up egg and served with tamarind, cilantro, red winemaple, and crispy potato stix. the shank was probably my favorite dish of the evening  the skin was so crunchy and i loved that spicy sauce, buttermilk dressing and served with butternut squash kimchi and naan. as with most places, i dreaded that dessert my ruin the wonderful meal. but, surprisingly, the desserts stood out just as much as the main courses. the chocolate pavlova saysame!  had a perfect texture and we loved the black sesame brittle & ice cream that went with the caramel chocolate sauce and sesame whip. my favorite might have to be the sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake , which deserves every single one of those descriptors. the sweet potato with miso caramel whip and pickled persimmon went very well with the sour cream ice cream, which gave it a nice sweet and sour combo. i can now see why stephanie izard won top chef as well as numerous other accolades including iron chef and a james beard award. great food all around and one of the best meals i have had in chicago!"
479,Greg G.,1126,4,10/29/18,"rd visit here, and girl & the goat is definitely a decently solid food choice in chicago. the food is not going to blow your mind, the wait can be super long, and the value is not quite there  but it is a fun place to visit. especially if you are into stephanie's work! so the main dish that stands out is the wood roasted pig face. now, do not let the name put you off  it is more of the tender meat of the cheek and the dish does not resemble a pig. for butchers and chefs, the cheek is actually a foughtover delicacy because it is very tender and flavorful and also scarce in quantity. get this dish every time  it will not disappoint you. honestly, if you cannot come back to girl & and the goat often, i would consider getting one order per two people that want to eat this. the other standout dish was the pork roast  which is much bigger than the pig face but also not nearly as flavorful. it is still very good and crispy and can help fill the carnivores of the party, so i would recommend getting this if you have at least one big eater in your party. the rest of the dishes are all solid choices  though nothing mindblowing at all. because of the limited amazing dishes here, girl and the goat is not our first mustgo places in our foodie world but since you are probably already here, here's a quick rundown.  wood roasted pig face just in case you skimmed the review and missed it above. get this  bread and butters there is usually  per season, with the mushroom butter usually being there. , cool imagination put into this, helps fill you, no need to get more than one.  happy juice it is nostalgic to me to get this. offmenu, and they have changed the formula since. i think it is now some kind of ginger beer and other juice. kinda small, but a tasty drink!  cauliflower i keep ordering this despite all my previous reviews saying it is not worth it. we got it again because our waitress really enjoyed it, but we agreed it is not worth it.  goat loin the meat itself was very tough for some reason. but the olives and mediterrean flavors around it were awesome. so  for the flavors,  for the meat.  scallops perfectly cooked. solid  overall, i am not sure if girl and the goat feels the need to innovate since they have so much demand through popularity. it is been  years since my last visit, and it felt even more commercialized than before. but if the formula works, then why fix what is not broken. i would probably only come here if someone really liked stephanie's work or the lines elsewhere are too long, and it happened to be short at g&tg. super cute logo still!"
480,Neha A.,1126,5,10/28/18," lives up to the hype, and then some, as evidenced in part by the thousands upon thousands of glowing reviews. there is a reason you have to make a reservation months in advance. the ambience is fun and vibrant, but also feels upscale and luxurious. it is not so loud and cramped where you feel like you cannot have a good conversation with your dining companions. the service is star as well. i have dined here a couple times and and tried the best of three cocktail, kohlrabi salad, pierogies, tuna, chickpea fritter, breads, cauliflower, broccoli, arctic char in curry sauce, scallops, and octopus. oh and two of the desserts . everything was phenomenal and every component of each dish worked well with one another, tasted fresh and delicious, and made it a cohesive dish. this is definitely a restaurant where you can point at the menu with your eyes closed, and be confident that whatever comes your way will be amazing. if you live in chicago and have not been yet, call now and make a reservation for the soonest they have available. you will not regret it."
481,Ben C.,1126,4,10/17/18,"reservations had been sold out long before i booked my work trip to chicago, but thanks to the amex platinum concierge i was able to obtain a late night seating for one after my flight arrived. the restaurant is typical chic for this style of establishment, with pretty much every table filled with people having a great time. it is the type of place that is meant to be enjoyed as a part of a large group and not as a solo diner, but i ended up here anyway since i do not live in chicago and wanted to try their food. i left about five minutes before closing and the restaurant did not show any signs of slowing down at all. service was prompt and to the point. i tried three dishesthe homemade brioche, the goat empanadas, and the confit goat. the brioche was very good, and both the empanadas and goat were amazingly savory. the lobster in the confit goat dish was so so good. since i was a solo diner i got major fomo when a nearby table had the roasted goat shoulder brought out it is a portion meant for large groups. dessert looked delicious, but i tapped out before giving into my desire for indulgence."
482,Farrah A.,1126,5,11/4/18,awesome cocktails  great start! great staff great service delicious creative unique dishes brought out in a timely manner for maximum enjoyment
483,Karen F.,1126,5,10/1/18,"what can i say that has not been said? yes, this place is amazing, yes, make your reservations now, yes, it will totally be worth it. i went in with a game plan, and it worked perfectly little nibbles, do not fill up! we had sourdough bread to start it was so amazing i could have eaten the whole loaf and been perfectly happy, but thanks to the aforementioned plan, i knew better. tables are super close together, which actually benefited us, because we made friends with three ladies from ca that were sat next to us, and started passing off all our extra food on them so we did not get too full too quickly. g&tg's system is to go from lighter dishes to heavier dishes, bringing out one at a time. i enjoyed this system, and it prevented our table from getting overcrowded. next was calamari bruschetta on goat milk ricotta fresh, rich flavor, not too chewy. followed this with the green beans, which were too salty for me, although the waiter said there is no added salt it was just salty from the anchovies in the fish sauce. goat empanadas next, perfectly cooked, with a very mild flavor. grand finale was the pig face, which was super rich it was like having pork belly and eggs over hash browns. delicious! probably my favorite item. i failed on dessert and ordered their house specialty called chocolate pavlova saysame! it was not sweet enough though and just tasted weird to me. fortunately jon had enough sense to order the caramel corn & malt balls vanilla malt ice cream, popcorn caramel, and chocolate she will. crazy delicious. drinks were awesome we tried a wide variety and service was spot on, bringing fresh plates and utensils every course, which i love. this restaurant deserves the hype, and you deserve to treat yourself."
484,Yoon B.,1126,4,11/3/18,"trendy tapas place. costs a pretty penny and then some. i think people go for the atmosphere and location. food is fun to share but nothing i have craved even once since our visit.  stars for location, ambience and service. food is..forgettable but not bad.."
485,Zeidy O.,1126,4,11/5/18,"food is really good, but the place is a little bit noisy which makes difficult to have a conversation, however food wise and service they have  stars! el lugar esta bonito y la comida muy rica, es un poco ruidoso lo que lo hace difcil para tener una conversacin pero la comida, bebidas y servicio son excelentes"
486,Frank K.,1126,5,11/2/18,"loved the food, service and the ambiance. had a reservation for  pm which was arranged by the hotel concierge. arrived on the minute but the table was not quite ready. grabbed a cocktail at the bar and the table was ready by  pm. maitre d was excellent in keeping us updated of the table status. once seated, our waitress and the team of staff were attentive and pleasant. the oysters were delicious. after my  year old verbalized how delicious the oysters were, they brought out a complimentary order of oysters on the house. it was a nice touch. hamachi crudo was delicious and flavorful. pig face is a must try as well. lamb shank with kimchee sauce was my favorite. all the dishes had a perfect balance of fat and acid. smaller dishes. we ordered  dishes for the party of . portions were perfect. we enjoyed our dining experience here. met and exceeded our expectations."
487,Rosemary V.,1126,5,9/23/18,"came here on a friday without reservations it is highly suggested that you make reservations weeks to months ahead of time, for those with no reservations please read on. we arrived  minutes before the restaurant was scheduled to open and there were already people waiting on the line. once they open the door, you will get in the line and they will let you know if they can sit you down without reservations based on time and amount of people of your party. if it is just two of you, then i recommend sitting at the bar which is what we did. if you are sitting at the bar, you do not have to announce it to the host. just run to the bar as soon as they open the door and get whatever seats are available. the good our bartenderwaiter asian male was amazing. he is passionate as he explains the menu making suggestions such as how many dishes to get based on your party and tips such as going from light to heavy. the use many local farms to make their dishes food i believe their menu is seasonal but we had goat liver mousse the bread that came with this was simply amazing vegetarian pierogies super tasty clams tasty sauce crab rangoon one of my favorite lamb ribs so soft it fell right off the bone and probably one of the tasty lamb dishes i have had..eva! complimentary broccoli good popcorncaramel ice cream dessert another food orgasm they play s hip hop which we loved yes we are old lol the bad i cannot think of anything final verdict so glad my fiance convinced me to go. if we return to chicago we are making reservations!"
488,Tara Lynn O.,1126,4,9/23/18,"we had to wait a little over a month for a reservation on a saturday night here. overall, the food was really good, however it i think it was over hyped for how long we had to wait for the reservation. they recommend about ~ dishes per person. we tried the best of three cocktail. it was refreshing. then we split the bread with the peppers and butter, goat empanadas, chickpea fritters, and bucatini. the bread and the bucatini were really good. it is a cool place to check out and try, but i think there are other options in the area that are better and do not require you to wait so long for a reservation."
489,Ilana O.,1126,4,9/16/18,"the place always bustling. the first time i went, honestly i thought it was overhyped, even though my friend and i did get seated right away in the front lounge type section. the second time, the service was impeccable, we were able to taste so much more, and it really felt like quintessential chicago. the taste ermergerd. i personally love ordering several dishes and tasting as many as possible, because i am a true millennial and do not want to commit to an entree. there were  of us, which meant we ordered a lot. [check out my pics]. the top dishes imo were the lamb ribs [the blueberry marinade was bomb] and the chickpea fritters atop the carrot hummus. i want carrot hummus everyday. we skipped dessert bc people were obsessed with the idea of getting donuts at the sox game after, and also we were pretty full af. my face whatever look you make when your mind is changed. before, i was all meh, even though i have watched at least one episode of i think every season of top chef, it is just ok now i'm like um if you go with a group, it is pretty great, and service is on point with refills and helpfulness. also, totally affordable, i think we all put in  for what was a pretty fantastic meal."
490,Amy Z.,1126,5,11/2/18,yes the reservation process sucks but if you can get a seat then its totally worth it! i have never been disappointed by the foodservices here and they always have something interesting and new on the menu the pig face is one of my favorite dishes! please get it! also i do not love lamb but my boyfriend says the lamb ribs were the best he is ever had in his entire life. so do not skip on that either if you like lamb!
491,Keith S.,1126,3,10/31/18,a bit disappointed. food did not live up to the expectation of a highly and widely recommended restaurant. octopus decent but not very memorable. shishito peppers strange that every pepper was spicy as hell. flavor was pretty good though. goat belly too buttery tempura walleye best dish of the night. tempura was on the heavy side but flavor was good. roast pig face  did not really like this dish. a more runny egg would have made the dish better. pork shank better than the pig face but still not that great. chocolate pavlova good but too sweet.
492,Matt W.,1126,5,10/30/18,"i had to book  months in advance for the girl & the goat, and even then, the earliest dinner reservation i could get was pm for a monday evening on opentable. that is how crazy people book in advance! i did not even know what i signed up for or even thought to comprehend that i would be eating goat meat here. all i knew was, if i were to go to chicago, i must go to the girl & the goat. that is what everyone said. and they were right. i did not regret it one bit. but note if you want to eat goat leg or goat shoulder, you must call and preorder one day in advance. the goat shoulder is lb with a lb minimum purchase. the goat leg was even larger.... we did not preorder because lb for  people was way too much food! however, there are other goat dishes that you can still order!!! rory mcilroy. broker'sÄã gin . lychee . pink peppercorn . black tea . lemon. this cocktail was one of the most refreshing, light and caffeinated cocktails i have ever had. i love the contrast of the tea and lychee and lemon yet the butter and sweet and sour flavors blended together so nicely. goat liver mousse. berry lamb jam . cranberry mostarda . bread & butter pickles. i really love this dish even though i feel like i might already be biased because i love pate and this is similar to pate in concept. the mousse was very light and soft yet rich in goat liver flavor. i enjoyed spreading the mousse on the bread. the contrast with the pickled sauces was a palate cleanser. hamachi crudo. chilisoy vinaigrette . finger hots . gooseberries . puffed black rice. this was everyone's favorite dish all around. i actually have never had good hamachi crudo before. the fish would always be so tough to chew. but these were as tender and soft and smooth as can be wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red winemaple . potato stix. hmm, i think this was my favorite!!! i just enjoyed eating the meat so much!! there was such good flavor in this dish. i think it is also the tamarind. crisp braised pork shank. buttermilk dressing . butternut squash kimchi . naan. wait!! i think this was my favorite too!!!! the pork shank was huge. the meat flakes off from the bones so easy. ugh. so. delicious. bucatini. milk braised pork shoulder . tomato. hmm, i think this was also my favorite!!!! the pasta was very soft and chewy. the light tomato sauce was milky and creamy from the milk braised. the pork was soooo tender! caramel corn & malt balls. vanilla malt ice cream . popcorn caramel . chocolate magic she will. and now let us end it with some birthday dessert with one of their famous desserts! i love the playful popcorn and chocolate and ice cream and caramel altogether! pros very friendly attentive service dim ambience with perfect environment for a date or a group huge restaurant, a lot of seating delicious food goat! plenty of other restaurants and bars around to hop to afterwards cons there are none! tip you can book on open table  months in advance"
493,Ben G.,1126,5,10/29/18,"rd visit here, and girl & the goat is definitely a decently solid food choice in chicago. the food is not going to blow your mind, the wait can be super long, and the value is not quite there  but it is a fun place to visit. especially if you are into stephanie's work! so the main dish that stands out is the wood roasted pig face . now, do not let the name put you off  it is more of the tender meat of the cheek and the dish does not resemble a pig . for butchers and chefs, the cheek is actually a foughtover delicacy because it is very tender and flavorful and also scarce in quantity. get this dish every time  it will not disappoint you. honestly, if you cannot come back to girl & and the goat often, i would consider getting one order per two people that want to eat this. the other standout dish was the pork roast  which is much bigger than the pig face but also not nearly as flavorful. it is still very good and crispy and can help fill the carnivores of the party, so i would recommend getting this if you have at least one big eater in your party. the rest of the dishes are all solid choices  though nothing mindblowing at all. because of the limited amazing dishes here, girl and the goat is not our first mustgo places in our foodie world but since you are probably already here, here's a quick rundown.  wood roasted pig face  just in case you skimmed the review and missed it above. get this  bread and butters there is usually  per season, with the mushroom butter usually being there. , cool imagination put into this, helps fill you, no need to get more than one.  happy juice it is nostalgic to me to get this. offmenu, and they have changed the formula since. i think it is now some kind of ginger beer and other juice. kinda small, but a tasty drink!  cauliflower i keep ordering this despite all my previous reviews saying it is not worth it. we got it again because our waitress really enjoyed it, but we agreed it is not worth it.  goat loin the meat itself was very tough for some reason. but the olives and mediterrean flavors around it were awesome. so  for the flavors,  for the meat.  scallops perfectly cooked. solid  overall, i am not sure if girl and the goat feels the need to innovate since they have so much demand through popularity. it is been  years since my last visit, and it felt even more commercialized than before. but if the formula works, then why fix what is not broken. i would probably only come here if someone really liked stephanie's work or the lines elsewhere are too long, and it happened to be short at g&tg. super cute logo still!"
494,Rachel H.,1126,5,10/28/18,"truly one of the greatest culinary experiences of my life. stephanie izard is a goddess!! watching her expedite throughout the evening just goes to show the dedication she has for her work. service was great our server was owen  food, flawless. we had the raw oysters, duck tongues, chickpea fritters, tempura walleye, green beans, octopus, pig face , chocolate pavlova and toffee cake. raw oysters were the perfect start to the meal. duck tongues were super fun, fresh and bright w the poke, the tongues reminded me of fried chicken skin. the carrot hummus with the chickpea fritter was my boyfriend's favorite part of the evening. tempura walleye's sauce underneath the crispy fish was lickthebowlworthy. green beans were lit. first time ever having octopus  a party to the face . the flavors were loud and i was living. the pig face meat itself reminded me of scrapple but, like, way better than scrapple lol and the sauces were bright and colorful and the egg was perfect. dessert was unreal. we should have ordered all . we had the cocktails it is always sunny in oaxaca, ring of fire, chaitown and fireside. all great, but fireside was definitely the best of the . thank you stephanie and co for helping me give my bf the best birthday dinner i could have ever asked for. will be back again."
495,Michelle T.,1126,5,10/28/18,"update  back for another visit to the girl and goat, and happy to say this experience was on par with our first. had reservation for pm on a saturday night very busy and was seated by pm. the staff was dressed in harry potter theme for halloween which was funny. we ordered the following on this go around smoked apple pirogies wood fired lamb ribs duck tongues wood oven roasted pig face goat neck chocolate pavlova saysame! dessert sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake dessert all nighter cocktail talkin about chaitown cocktail rory mcilroy cocktail everything was top notch just like our last visit. we purposely tried new things this go around, since each item is always so good. the exception being the roasted pig face ... hard to not get that one again. favorites had to be the lamb ribs one of the best things i have had in my life and the goat neck more food than other entrees... this was a special so probably not always available. as usual you get through a couple small plates together and think  man this is good but will it fill me up? then by the end you are totally stuffed. we definitely spent more this time  on just cocktails. the all nighter is good but wow is it strong. probably why they give you half a glass worth lol. we will be back. hard to beat this place."
496,Molly J.,1126,5,10/28/18,"my husband and i tried our luck without a reservation on halloween saturday props on the flawless execution of dumbledore and umbridge! to celebrate our  year anniversary after a  minute wait we snagged a couple corner seats at the large community tables in the lounge area. we ordered a couple beers,  small plates, a dessert and an espresso. bill was  and worth every penny! experience, ambiance, surrounding people and guests, service, support staff, restrooms, even the harry potter theme for some of the staff costumes this place is wonderful before the food even enters into the equation! we ordered smoked apple pierogis, sweet potato bread, goat empanadas, mussels, beef tongue, and pig face . sweet potato cake and sour cream ice cream for dessert. dark matter espresso was served with integrity, piping hot and with some delicious crema intact by the time it reached our table.  across the board."
497,Jeff J.,1126,5,10/25/18,"food ordered that we really enjoyed  branzino se asian flavors.  broccoli enjoyed the smokey flavors  cauliflower pickled, so do not order if you do not like sour flavors  octopus more unique stuff we enjoyed as well  chickpea  duck tongue we enjoyed it, but note that its on the fatty side  pig face kind of similar to asian cuisine but not exactly alike so its worth ordering  dessert aw, honey honey the goat capriccio itself did not have much flavor, could have skipped it. the hamachi crudo was not bad, but not a stand out. i have not been to many restaurants where almost all the dishes were amazing. it was our favorite meal in chicago. i cannot wait for them to open their second store in la next year!"
498,Ann H.,1126,5,10/24/18,"ever since i watched top chef more than  years ago, i have had this spot bookmarked on my yelp page. it is been sitting in the to try section until now. i have finally crossed this one off the bucket list, and with all the expectations that had built up over the years, i have to say that it exceeded mine. the menu is set up to be shared familystyle and we enjoyed picking a bunch of plates to share. the style seemed to be a modern twist on comfort food, which is something we enjoy. we ordered a couple of vegetable dishes including the sauteed green beans  and the roasted cauliflower . for something so simple like greenbeans and cauliflower, our tastebuds were blown away from the getgo. the green beans had a great fish sauce vinaigrette and the cashews gave it an asianinspired flavor. the cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mints all blended well together. who would have thought that mint would go well with cauliflower? and unlike most cauliflower dishes, this one did not stink maybe the mint helped?! for our fish dish, we got the seared scallops  with wild maitake and wood ears, oyster sauce brodo, and squash brandade. very well seared and flavorful. as the name implied, we had to get a couple of goat dishes and went with the goat empanadas  and the confit goat belly . we loved the flavor of the goat in the empanadas as it was not too gamey or heavy. the miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco, brightened up the dish. the confit goat belly was probably my least favorite dish because it was so heavy with the bourbon butter, which coated all of the goat belly, lobster, crab, and fennel. a couple pork dishes stood out with the wood oven roasted pig face  as well as the mustorder crisp braised pork shank . i thought these were two of the best plates. the pig face had a perfect sunny side up egg and served with tamarind, cilantro, red winemaple, and crispy potato stix. the shank was probably my favorite dish of the evening  the skin was so crunchy and i loved that spicy sauce, buttermilk dressing and served with butternut squash kimchi and naan. as with most places, i dreaded that dessert my ruin the wonderful meal. but, surprisingly, the desserts stood out just as much as the main courses. the chocolate pavlova saysame!  had a perfect texture and we loved the black sesame brittle & ice cream that went with the caramel chocolate sauce and sesame whip. my favorite might have to be the sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake , which deserves every single one of those descriptors. the sweet potato with miso caramel whip and pickled persimmon went very well with the sour cream ice cream, which gave it a nice sweet and sour combo. i can now see why stephanie izard won top chef as well as numerous other accolades including iron chef and a james beard award. great food all around and one of the best meals i have had in chicago!"
499,Andrea M.,1126,1,10/24/18," worth the hype. everything from the service to the lighting and obviously the food was perfect. our server was extremely helpful and guided us through the menu, providing suggestions and even a few items on the house because they paired nicely with what we had ordered!!! the goat empanadas were amazing, as was the pig face and the green beans!!! when i go back i will skip dessert and order more appetizers."
500,Letty S.,1126,4,10/22/18,"just wow. this was one epic meal, and at a very reasonable price. my friend and i ordered  plates, plus two desserts. the final bill was far less than expected. the food blew me away. the flavor profiles and design were stunning. arctic char, pig face , and lamb ribs were the stars, but every plate of food makes you savor every single bite. it is that good. this meal was one for the ages. service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. i cannot properly put into words how much i enjoyed this meal. i cannot wait to return, when i go back to chicago."
501,Kathryn E.,1126,5,10/21/18,"the duck tongue is awesome. full of flavor but not heavy at all. the green been is also great, pig face is not taste like face . the pork shank is meat lover's favorite, but a little rich for me. the service is good"
502,Connie U.,1126,5,10/20/18,"my girlfriend and i came here right at opening  pm and sat at the bar since we did not have a reservation. we ordered the pig face and lamb ribs, which were both good, but that was where the good things about this restaurant ended. this was the absolute worst restaurant experience either of us have ever had, the bartenders were beyond rude and condescending. as soon as we told the bartender we would not be ordering any drinks, she glared at us and proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time we were there while being extremely friendly to the people next to us who were spending hundreds. someone needs to teach the servers that they need to treat everyone with respect, not just the rich customers. would never come back or recommend to anyone."
503,Krystal R.,1126,5,10/18/18,"went on a thursday night.... full house... there was no wait,  reservation. i went with my husband and my father. excellent service... our waiter suggested  plates, so we did  they came out in this order.. steam mussels.... good but not enough bread to deep in the broth scallops .... they melted like butter, my only complain would be the price .... it came with only two scallops goat empanas very good... plate came with two small size empanadas ...  would i order them again, yes, but pricey for the amount of food you are getting! lamb ribs too gamey pig face  the dish i was looking forward to and guess what i would not order it again! is a breakfast meal... one egg on top of two pieces of thick bacon... nothing special about it... just go to wildberry cafe and you will get a better dish and more filling for the same price pork shank we loved, but were too full to finish it, since it was the last dish to come out.  i order a cocktail ... best of three... very good, but pricey   small dishes except for the pork shank, one cocktail  plus gratuity... i do not think i will return anytime soon. we loved three dishes shank, mussels and empanadas, liked the other, and could careless about the pig face and the lamb ribs. the restaurant is nice but loud expected ... i would skip the pig face  sure, do not understand the hype behind it ... service was excellent!"
504,Paula T.,1126,5,10/12/18,"if i could give this place  out of  stars, i would. it was just that good. when you walk in, the ambiance is cool and inviting. modern and clean. somewhat dark but not too dark. dress is nice but casual. the dinner plates are small, so between  of us, we ordered twenty things! we were super full and had some to take home, but each thing we ordered was amazing! for appetizers we ordered the roasted beets  awesome! the chickpea fritters  they tasted amazing but there were only two small fritters  not much food for the  price. everyone raves about the green beans. my brotherinlaw loved them, but i thought they tasted a little too salty from the fish oil or soy sauce. plus, they had cashews and i am not a cashew fan. they were good but not great. we also ordered the pan fried peppers  really good! for entrees we ordered the halibut  one of my favorite things of the night. it was a party in my mouth! seared scallops  not a fan of scallops, i do not like the texture, but the food around it was good. pig face  uhmazing! like bacon and eggs but  times better! grilled chicken  fabulous! pork shank  ooohhhh sooo good! goat loin  first time i have ever had goat meat and it was amazing! i loved how it was prepared with a little tahini yogurt and delicious little pitas! yum!!!! seriously some of the best food i have ever tasted!! you must go here! now i need to try her other restaurants!!!"
505,Olivia M.,1126,5,10/9/18,"probably the best food i have had in chicago! reservations are hard to come by but it is worth the wait. there are so many gluten free options! i am gluten intolerant but my friend, who is not, wanted to get everything gluten free so we could share all plates. the waiters were very nice and accommodating. when possible they gave the gluten part of the meal for my friend separate from the meal so she could still enjoy the dish as it was supposed to be served! there is home made gluten free bread here!!! it was a little dense but still very good. the goat empanada was so good and juicy. the wood fired lam ribs melted off the bone. wood oven roasted pig face was to die for. the crisp braised pork shank was a little drying. overall, it was such a great experience!"
506,Kevin L.,1126,5,10/9/18,"lived up to all expectations! make reservations and order and split as many plates as you can.. i do not think any of them could be a let down. we got the pig face , goat belly, & scallops and each dish was unique and delicious. the atmosphere was great.. not too loud & cozy."
507,Lauryn P.,1126,5,10/7/18,"when a friend of mine mentioned that the girl & the goat was one of the best meals they have ever had in their life, i knew i had to make a trip out during my chicago vacation. the universe must have been on my side the day i tried getting reservations because after a few minutes, i was able to snag a  dinner on my first night. fyi the restaurant will call you  days before your reservation to confirm. when we arrived, the restaurant was completely packed and it was a wednesday night! the g&g definitely emits an overall vibeyclassycool comfortable feel. i like that people dressed up but it is lowkey enough to wear jeans. okay, so on to the food! our server who was very nice and accommodating recommended  plates for a party of . we ordered  the sesame grape sourdough with black sesame butter yum!!  goat empanadas  braised beef tongue shishito peppers  roasted pig face . i was completely blown away with the flavors & the execution of the dishes! the g&g is probably one of tastiest dining experiences i have ever had! my only pit of the evening was the carmel corn and malt balls dessert. it was extremely salty! my boyfriend and i could not finish it because the salt was just too overpowering. "
508,Addison P.,1126,4,10/4/18,"oh my gosh, what a wonderful meal! my husband and i finally used a gift card we had received for this restaurant and it was such an enjoyable experience. the server was so great, really helped with giving us recommendations. everything is shared, they recommend  plates per person. we decided on bread, green beans, salmon, oven roasted pig face , confit goat belly, and caramel corn malt balls to top it all off. seriously, everything i ate was delicious. i think my favorites were the salmon, it definitely was way better than it is described on the menu, and the confit goat belly, which was rich and decadent. i left extremely full and extremely satisfied. highly recommend!"
509,Gigi M.,1126,5,11/2/18,"wow. just wow. girl and the goat definitely lives up to the hype in my honest opinion. for years i have been skeptical about trying the main restaurant as i was not sure if i would enjoy it. who wants to eat pig face? well i am really glad i was wrong. making reservations for a large group  people last minute is possible if you do not mind going at  pm. even then the restaurant is popping! i am pretty sure you could even come with a smaller party or just with two people if you do not mind walking in during the tail end of their hours. being our first time there, our server explained how it is essentially tapas style, and recommended we get  dishes to allow us to try a variety of items. off the top of my head, we had the brussel sprouts, sauted green beans, roasted cauliflower, seared scallops, bucatini, crisp braised pork shank , and the wood oven roasted pig face. i consider myself to be pretty picky with what i eat, but man... everything we tried just blew me away. i am no food expert so i cannot really describe it, but the flavors that were coming out of each dish was incredible. my favorite dish was the pig face. you would think gross! that is a face but man... i dream about that dish from time to time. mixed with the sunny side egg, it is really creamy and tender. tldr girl & the goat is a definite must try if you are ever visiting or live in chicago and have never been. the flavors that are coming out of their dishes are wild and incredible. probably one of my favorite dining experiences."

511,Molly B.,1126,5,10/24/18,"ever since i watched top chef more than  years ago, i have had this spot bookmarked on my yelp page. it is been sitting in the to try section until now. i have finally crossed this one off the bucket list, and with all the expectations that had built up over the years, i have to say that it exceeded mine. the menu is set up to be shared familystyle and we enjoyed picking a bunch of plates to share. the style seemed to be a modern twist on comfort food, which is something we enjoy. we ordered a couple of vegetable dishes including the sauteed green beans  and the roasted cauliflower . for something so simple like greenbeans and cauliflower, our tastebuds were blown away from the getgo. the green beans had a great fish sauce vinaigrette and the cashews gave it an asianinspired flavor. the cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mints all blended well together. who would have thought that mint would go well with cauliflower? and unlike most cauliflower dishes, this one did not stink maybe the mint helped?! for our fish dish, we got the seared scallops  with wild maitake and wood ears, oyster sauce brodo, and squash brandade. very well seared and flavorful. as the name implied, we had to get a couple of goat dishes and went with the goat empanadas  and the confit goat belly . we loved the flavor of the goat in the empanadas as it was not too gamey or heavy. the miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco, brightened up the dish. the confit goat belly was probably my least favorite dish because it was so heavy with the bourbon butter, which coated all of the goat belly, lobster, crab, and fennel. a couple pork dishes stood out with the wood oven roasted pig face  as well as the mustorder crisp braised pork shank . i thought these were two of the best plates. the pig face had a perfect sunny side up egg and served with tamarind, cilantro, red winemaple, and crispy potato stix. the shank was probably my favorite dish of the evening  the skin was so crunchy and i loved that spicy sauce, buttermilk dressing and served with butternut squash kimchi and naan. as with most places, i dreaded that dessert my ruin the wonderful meal. but, surprisingly, the desserts stood out just as much as the main courses. the chocolate pavlova saysame!  had a perfect texture and we loved the black sesame brittle & ice cream that went with the caramel chocolate sauce and sesame whip. my favorite might have to be the sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake , which deserves every single one of those descriptors. the sweet potato with miso caramel whip and pickled persimmon went very well with the sour cream ice cream, which gave it a nice sweet and sour combo. i can now see why stephanie izard won top chef as well as numerous other accolades including iron chef and a james beard award. great food all around and one of the best meals i have had in chicago!"
512,Heather H.,1126,5,10/9/18,"probably the best food i have had in chicago! reservations are hard to come by but it is worth the wait. there are so many gluten free options! i am gluten intolerant but my friend, who is not, wanted to get everything gluten free so we could share all plates. the waiters were very nice and accommodating. when possible they gave the gluten part of the meal for my friend separate from the meal so she could still enjoy the dish as it was supposed to be served! there is home made gluten free bread here!!! it was a little dense but still very good. the goat empanada was so good and juicy. the wood fired lam ribs melted off the bone. wood oven roasted pig face was to die for. the crisp braised pork shank was a little drying. overall, it was such a great experience!"
513,Brian B.,1126,5,9/8/18,just had a fabulous meal at girl and the goat and cannot say enough great things about my experience. the staff was friendly and welcoming and the food was delicious. the beet salad was fresh and creative and the braised pork shank was succulent and flavorful. i cannot wait to go back for another dining experience.
514,Nancy P.,1126,5,8/27/18,"ordered roasted cauliflower sauteed green beans soft she will crab cake wood oven roasted pig face crisp braised pork shank confit goat belly pan roasted halibut caramel corn & malt balls our favorites were the crab cake and the pork shank . order more naan for the pork shank . it is not enough and the meat is so fatty, it is not good to eat it by itself. overall it was a good meal but not earth shattering good."
515,Daphne M.,1126,5,8/26/18,"this place was absolutely amazing. i did not have reservations but my partner and i found a seat right away at the bar. there we were greeted by jason who was very knowledgeable in the menu and gave us some great options. for starters we had the goat liver moose delicious, then the corn perogies favorite, confit goat belly amazing, sauted green beans on the house, and the crisp braised pork shank . the liver moose was very good and filling, so i would not recommend if you are getting many items like this. by the end of the moose dish we were pretty full. the perogies were so good. honestly the best i have ever had, cooked to perfection with a latin spin to them. the confit goat belly had a butterscotch flavor to it that made the entire dish, i mean it was just perfect. we were surprised when a server came by and dropped off the green beans dish on the house. the green beans were the best green beans i have ever had. the fish sauce was perfect and not too overbearing, and the green beans were cooked perfectly. lastly we had the pork shank . this was a large plate and we were so full that we had to take most of it to go. honestly it was my least favorite dish, but it was still really good and cooked perfectly. jason was such an amazing server bartender. all the options he gave us did not disappoint and he checked up on us at appropriate times where we did not feel forgotten or too pushed. honestly great service! his drinks were also top notch. it was nice having conversation with fabian as well. just very polite gentlemen, good service, and great food. i plan on becoming a regular here. such an amazing first visit!!!!"
516,Alisha W.,1126,5,7/19/18,"when my friends and i decided to take a trip to chicago, we made sure to make a reservation at girl & the goat. i am so glad we did. we came about  minutes before our reservation, but still got seated right away, which was amazing. we decided to order  dishes for  people and that was more than enough especially because we would been eating the whole day. roasted cauliflower this was a great dish to start off with. it was light and flavorful. i could not stop eating it. skuna bay salmon one of the most amazing salmon dishes i have ever had. i thought it would be weird putting strawberries with salmon, but it was actually good. the strawberry balanced out the fattiness of the salmon. there is a little kick of heat, which made me want more. wood oven roasted pig face my favorite dish of all! the pig face just melted in my mouth. the sauces balanced out the saltiness of the pig face and together, it is just amazing. i wanted to order another one. crisp braised pork shank  ordered this based on the reviews on yelp. i actually was not a fan of the pork shank . alone, the pork shank did not have enough flavor, big paired with the sauces, it was good. the dish is also served with naan, and everything together was pretty good. goat belly this dish was very small. i actually did not even know where the belly was because it was covered by onions and greens. the goat belly is also served with lobster. it was so small that i was not sure what i was tasting, but it was still delicious. all their dishes were not heavy and i would definitely recommend trying all of the dishes i ordered."
517,Mike R.,1126,5,7/14/18,"this restaurant is so amazing. if you are nearby and do not go, you are doing yourself a great disservice. the shishito peppers with miso still appear in my dreams. the crisp braised pork shank ... a gift from above. i ate so much at this meal that i felt i might physically explode and yet it was so delicious i could not stop eating. i would sell my soul if it meant i could eat here everyday"
518,Ee Vonn Y.,1126,5,7/8/18,"believe the hype! the best meal you will ever eat! you must make a trip here. my rank over two visits jan and june  pig face must get for meat eaters confit goat belly sockeye salmon green beans  crisp braised pork shank kohlrabi salad goat empanadas good but not memorable this is the kind of place where no matter what you order, it will be delicious! make your reservation and head on over! you will be glad you did."
519,Rick D.,1126,5,7/6/18,"hands down our best dining experience in chicago!!!    this place has really transformed our dining experiences, my girlfriend and i fell in love with this place. a few friends of mine in the restaurant industry highly recommended this place to us, as did all the online hype regarding this establishment. girl & the goat lived up to the recommendations and surpassed them by a lot!!!! i called and tried to make a reservation a few days prior to coming into chicago from san diego, we were not sure on our schedule and how we could make this dining experience work. once i called, the prime time dinner hours were booked on the day we wanted, i am not surprised at all after our dining experience. so, we just chose to show up right when they open at pm. we were seated almost immediately and the hostess and manager were extremely kind and very welcoming upon our entry. once we were seated, almost immediately a busser came by with water for us, like ninja quick. extremely attentive young man, he was hustlin' and bustlin' around the restaurant, kudos to him, very hard efficient worker. our server, trevor, greeted us in a very welcoming manner and really took us along for the ride with our dining experience. i ordered a glass of roccascossa red wine, it was very delightful and the staff favorite. i had a martini at another bar right before, while we were waiting for this place to open, so i was trying to behave myself because i was on a date with my lady. i really wanted to try a few other cocktails but we had things to do after our meal. trevor took us through the menu and gave us recommendations and assisted in suggestions and possibilities for my girlfriend's dairy allergy. he was extremely helpful. this place has small plates that are meant to share with one another, such an awesome concept. we started with the sourdough blueberry bread with a homemade berry lamb jam and spring onion cream cheese. she loves bread and we loved this bread, in fact she is going to try and make it at home, good luck babe. the berry lamb jam was like nothing i have ever had before, i wish they sold jars of it. i would wash my face with this stuff in the morning, lol. hamachi crudo, chilisoy vinaigrette, finger hots, pickled kumquats and puffed black rice melted in your mouth like butter, so damn good!! next, we ordered the green beans cooked in a fish sauce vinaigrette with cashews. oh my goodness these were aaaaaaammazing!! cooked to perfection and tasted like no other green beans i have had before. best part is, i got to eat most of these because she is not the biggest fan of green beans, thanks honey! pan roasted halibut with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham and beech mushroom. my mouth is literally still watering from this dish two weeks later, i was so happy i ordered this. it was on my radar before arriving to the restaurant after looking at the menu online. i want another one!! because this dish was made with butter and my girlfriend could not share, our server trevor dropped off a small portion of the kohlrabi salad for her to enjoy. it was made with fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, roasted shiitake and blueberries. it was such a nice gesture and she really loved the salad while i indulged on my halibut. she let me try her salad, it was very very good. finally, we ordered the crisp braised pork shank , with buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion & radish kimchi with naan. this was so damn good because of the crispiness on the outside was perfection, very very impressed. the naan bread was so fluffy and delicious we almost ordered another piece. best naan we have ever ate, hands down! as we were approaching the possibility of dessert, we realized we had to get going to get on our architectural boat tour of the city that was boarding in  minutes. we asked for the check because we did not have much time, and right before the check arrived, trevor came by to drop off a side of the blackberry sorbet i think because my girlfriend was intrigued by this item. he really made our dining experience extremely memorable and created this amazing experience for the two of us. i have been in the industry since  and it is really hard to find great people like him, thank you very much sir we greatly appreciate your wholehearted customer service! overall an absolute must try if you are in the city of chicago!!! the food was absolutely delicious, flavorful and creative. everything was cooked to perfection, the ambiance was very warming and soothing. the staff was incredible, you can tell how well the staff works together and it really sets the tone for the restaurant. kudos to the owner and management for this well oiled machine, you guys are a blessing to society. once again, thank you trevor for one of our best dining experiences this year, you are a rock star dude. if you ever come to san diego, let me know i will take care of you and return the favor. cheers!!"
520,Jen N.,1126,5,6/27/18,"this place was amazing! the space is very chic and trendy but yet casual and comfortable. wait staff was knowledgeable about the food and made some wonderful recommendations. we had the sweet onion brioche, blueberry sourdough, warm marinated olives, sauted green beans, roasted beats, duck tongues, wood fire lamb ribs, crisp braised pork shank . everything was delicious but my favorite dishes were the duck tongues and green beans. the duck tongues were nice and crispy but soft in the inside, went well with the freshness of the poke. the green beans were super tasty, fresh, cooked to perfection, nice acid from the vinaigrette, they were like nothing i had ever had before. it is a must eat place while in chicago!"
521,Jimmy D.,1126,5,6/19/18,"this may have been the best meal i have ever had! i am so glad i got the opportunity to eat here! every single thing i ate and drank was delicious! i highly recommend the crisp braised pork shank that creamy dressing was the best, green garlic pie perogies, and the sauted green beans! dessert = pavlova = amazing. the ring of fire drink is also amazing! enjoyed the pan roasted halibut as well. service was excellent! i am so looking forward to it opening in la!"
522,Kelly D.,1126,5,6/18/18,"we had a fantastic meal. from our server, kristen, to our very last bite  it was perfection. it might be easier to list what we did not try! but this is what we tasted sauted green beans do not be fooled these were the bomb, roasted beets, wood grilled broccoli omg, green garlic pierogies omg, sockeye salmon, grilled pork belly, fried oysters, goat empanadas, ramp marinated grilled chicken, crisp braised pork shank , lemon make you happy and oh yes it did, rhubarb shortcake, and caramel corn and malt balls magic she will people!!!. just outstanding!!!!"
523,Cuc N.,1126,5,6/17/18,"my wife and i took a long weekend trip to chicago for some dining and sight seeing. monteverde & alinea were the first two places to visit, and we could not see how things could get better. along comes girl and the goat, and things got even better. most enjoyable meal of the trip, even though the only reservation we could get was  pm kind of an early dinner i guess. space was comfortable, service very friendly and knowledgeable, but the food was the bomb!! started with the oyster combo of wood fired and fried oysters. best fried oysters ever. crispy coating, flavorful oysters and great dipping sauce. server delivered a complimentary order of the chickpea fritters. thoughtful and tasty. the entrees we chose were the halibut with blueberry nuoc cham as well as the crisp braised pork shank . both were  star entrees. the halibut perfectly cooked with an asian flare. the pork was very flavorful and served with an excellent naan bread. we had to get something from the goat portion of the menu, and chose the empanadas. i loved them, but my wife felt they were a little gamey for her taste. we had the caramel corn and malt balls for dessert.  addicting!! highly recommend girl and the goat!! work on your reservation well in advance however."
524,Greg G.,1126,4,6/3/18,"might be my favorite restaurant in chicago. interior  decorative, classy, and fun. service  good. dishes are timed on point to make sure you enjoy each item sufficiently before the next dish is delivered so you are not swamped with  dishes at the same time all out of order. roasted cauliflower pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint  there is cheese. delicious, salted, savory, soft, and tastes like home. escargot ravioli bacon tamarind sauce, escarole & celery, crispy onions  could not taste the escargot. resembled more like flattened dumplings in some broth. loved it. pan roasted halibut marcona almond butter, white asparagus . blueberry nuoc cham, beech mushroom  fish sauce!! it was truly delicious and honored the vietnamese fish sauce taste without watering it down. must order. crisp braised pork shank buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion & radish kimch, naan  pork falls off the bone. delicious, savory, soft. naan is decent but the pork is so good without it. lemon make you happy lemonÄã pound cake, sorrel ice cream, almond crunch, cheesecake sauce  my husband hates lemon and pound cake but he ate it all. must order. the jam old forester bourbon, strawberry shrub, saison  the perfect refreshing summer strawberry drink."
525,Bailey Z.,1126,5,6/2/18,"the  of us ordered many items from this restaurant and shared everything. my faves were the crisp braised pork shank ample portion, wood fired lamb ribs, shuna bay salmon salmon salad w strawberries, pan fried shishito peppers, roasted beets beet salad, and the raw oysters. these we all so delicious. you should try this restaurant, you will be pleasantly surprised how good it is. rick d, san diego, ca."
526,Cuc N.,1126,5,5/31/18,"great food and service. it is best to go with a few people so you can try multiple items. we sat at the kitchen bar table, was fun to watch all the dishes being created. we had sauted green beans, roasted beets, squash blossom rangoon, wood fired whole branzino, bucatini, crisp braised pork shank , and the goat belly. all were delicious and had so many flavors. the wine selection is decent with many price points for everyone. it can get very loud when the restaurant is full, so may not be best for a business meal."
527,Bailey Z.,1126,5,5/29/18,"this place is fun and definitely different in terms of food. everything was prepared very well and seemed to have a lot of asian influences in the food. great family style restaurant to dine with friends.  people would be nice to try a lot of stuff. get roasted cauliflower  nice flavors and topped with the pickled peppers. balanced. beef tonguefelt like it was more of a light salad that was well cooked and balanced wood oven roasted pig face  flavor and texture overload here. definitely a favorite crisp braised pork shank the skin was so crispy and the portion was big. another favorite goat confit  not gamey, and paired nicely with the crab. very rich dish and portion was tiny. skip sauted green beans  it reminded me of an asian dish that did not differ too much other than the price service everything came out fast and waiter was very knowledgeable. if you can get a reservation, definitely worth going here for a splurge."
528,Connie U.,1126,5,5/27/18,"the hype is real! definitely make a reservation a few weeks ahead of time. a few months ahead of time would be recommended if you are looking to dine at prime dinner times like friday or saturday night. i finally planned ahead of time to enjoy dinner at girl & the goat on my most recent trip to chicago and really enjoyed my experience. plates at girl & the goat are meant to be shared. for our group of four, we each got a cocktail, shared the foccacia bread, two veggie dishes, and four meat dishes. perfect amount of food. my favorites were the roasted cauliflower, wood oven roasted pig face, and crisp braised pork shank . the flavors across the dishes were playful, unlike anything i have ever had, with asian influences like the creamy cashew nuts in the green beans, spicy kimchi flavors in the sauce that came with the lamb shank , bright mint cilantro flavors. i loved the layers of savory, sweet, bright, refreshing flavors in the dishes. great experience. service was attentive and food came out quickly. girl & the goat is not only a nice place to grab dinner, it is an experience to fully emerge yourself in, that creates conversation about everyone's favorite topic, food!"
529,Molly J.,1126,5,10/24/18," worth the hype. everything from the service to the lighting and obviously the food was perfect. our server was extremely helpful and guided us through the menu, providing suggestions and even a few items on the house because they paired nicely with what we had ordered!!! the goat empanadas were amazing, as was the pig face and the green beans!!! when i go back i will skip dessert and order more appetizers."
530,Marella M.,1126,5,10/24/18,"this place is a must go if you are in the chicago area! love it! ambiance  hip, but not pretentious. while it is not super fancy, i love the lofty like feel and decor. sat inside and while it is a bit loud it is always crowded, i did not feel like i had to scream at my friends to be heard. service host welcoming yay, someone likes and values their job!, kind and very accommodating to our groups changing needs. we arrived early and they were able to help get us in a bit quicker than expected  with a smile! bar was completely different. to be fair, it was pretty packed. but when i went to the end of the bar only clear area, female bartender flatly said, he will help you over there. uh, okay  i guess i was in the way of the waiters getting drinks...but, um, rude much?  so i moved to stand behind people eatingdrinking and patiently waited to get one of the male bar tenders attention. being vertically challenged and fully bundled up for chicago weather did not help! there were very lovely young ladies at the bar chatting it up nothing wrong with that, i just need a few drinks peeps  get your flirt on! annoyed that they seemed annoyed by the interruption. lol  whatever! service however, not even  minutes after that irritating experience, one of the lovely hostesses came and showed us to our table! yay! our waitress was awesome as she walked our group though the ordering process and what to expect. the servers were all wonderful, providing full descriptions of each dish as they were placed on the table. and, the servers that kept magically refilling our drinks & waters and see if we needed anything. food amazing! they never disappoint! loved the broccoli, flavorful hummus, incredible goat empanadas , perfectly tender octopus with tastiest mole, and the popcorn malt balls for dessert! scrumptious! i will definitely be back every time i am in chicago! do not miss this place if you are here!"
531,Tracy C.,1126,3,10/22/18,"is it really worth the wait ? really depends on what you wanted to experience. i made my reservation two months in advance. the presentations of the food is spoton. not too sure about the flavor profile presented in one or two dishes here. maybe it is just me who has rather a peasant's taste buds, the dish hamachi crudo does not seem to click with me. despite that, braised beef tongue, duck tongues , goat empanadas were really good. the dessert,, aw, honey honey, was standard. to me, the definition of good food is something that makes you crave, a good restaurant is a place that makes good food that keeps you wanting to go back, it is clean, fresh , healthy but does not have to be fancy. unfortunately, girl and the goat is not that place for me. but overall, it is a really good yet interesting experience. if i have friends coming to visit again, i will take them to girl and the goat ."
532,Katy Q.,1126,5,10/21/18,"we booked this place a month ahead and we got at reservation at pm on a saturday! the hostess said we could come early and might be seated early. we arrived around pm and the wait was later than pm so we hung out at the bar waiting for out reservation. we got some drinks and an appetizer. then got seated at . i think we got a very good seat the chef table, it is like watching a cooking show while enjoying our foods. the drink  drink. we got chaitown and oaxaca. oaxaca was very smooth and the turmeric flavor was very interesting. i loved it a lot. chaitown was a bit boozier but overall it was good as well. the foods it was phenomenal!!!! i loved everything we tried. we had goat empanadas , green beans, beef tongue, and pork shank, cauliflower, shishito pepper and broccoli. dessert was on the house, it was sour ice cream with pickle persimmons.  pork shank my favorite. very crispy on the outside but tender inside and the meat were falling off the bone as you eat.  beef tongue perfect combination of all the flavor. especially, the pickles in the salad, it added a little zesty taste to the whole dish.  all vegetables dishes were wellseasoned, perfect fast with a umani flavor  dessert we were too full for it, but you cannot waste foods. so we tried it and it was sooo delicious we finished everything the service very good customer service. we had some interaction with the chefs since we are at the chef table. shout out to the  one big guy with a beard and one with a knife tattoo on his forearm they took good care of us!!! we were very pleased with our experience here! definitely will come back in the future and highly recommended to everyone. it worth every pennies you spend!"

535,Paula T.,1126,5,10/7/18,"when a friend of mine mentioned that the girl & the goat was one of the best meals they have ever had in their life, i knew i had to make a trip out during my chicago vacation. the universe must have been on my side the day i tried getting reservations because after a few minutes, i was able to snag a  dinner on my first night. fyi the restaurant will call you  days before your reservation to confirm. when we arrived, the restaurant was completely packed and it was a wednesday night! the g&g definitely emits an overall vibeyclassycool comfortable feel. i like that people dressed up but it is lowkey enough to wear jeans. okay, so on to the food! our server who was very nice and accommodating recommended  plates for a party of . we ordered  the sesame grape sourdough with black sesame butter yum!!  goat empanadas  braised beef tongue shishito peppers  roasted pig face. i was completely blown away with the flavors & the execution of the dishes! the g&g is probably one of tastiest dining experiences i have ever had! my only pit of the evening was the carmel corn and malt balls dessert. it was extremely salty! my boyfriend and i could not finish it because the salt was just too overpowering.

536,Stacie H.,1126,5,9/30/18,"we were in the city and multiple people had recommended this restaurant so we decided to give it a shot despite not having reservations. we showed up at about  pm on a saturday night and hung around at the bar and eventually got two seats. the bartenders were very attentive and knowledgeable. cocktails were so tasty and unique. we ordered goat empanadas , roasted cauliflower, calamari bruschetta, and pig face. all the plates were excellent, but my favorite was the bruschetta. overall, wonderful experience!"
537,Mrs. A.,1126,5,9/20/18,"my husband and i arrived early before they opened hoping to get a seat at the bar because we did not have reservations. we ended up getting the best seats in the house! we had front row seats overlooking all of the chefs hard at work. the kitchen runs like a well oiled machine and executive iron chef izard inspects every plate before it is served. the chefs were working hard and having fun and it was an incredible experience. the food we ordered was fresh, flavorful and unique. we ordered goat empanadas that had the perfect balance between moist savory meat and golden brown perfectly cooked dough. the pineapple salsa provided the refreshing citrus counterbalance. the wood fire grilled broccoli with bleu cheese was to die for! it paired perfectly with peter piper bread with honey poblano butter and pickle relish. the service was fantastic and friendly. our server jake was very thoughtful to point out everything that had shellfish in it because of my allergy. my husband loved the bronzino. he said the skin was perfectly crisp and shrimp broth it was served in was so good it could stand alone as a soup. the goat satay i ordered was upscale gyro flavors with tzatziki sauce. the goat had the same texture as what you would expect from perfectly done lamb on a spit. overall, iron chef izard & the goat exceeded our high expectations!"
538,Gina P.,1126,5,9/19/18,"we ate at this restaurant on a sunday night and it was packed! good thing we had reservations as we were a party of ! our waitress was inventive and charming. she suggested we order a bunch of different dishes and share them which is something this group likes to do anyway,especially if the food is very different . we had over  different dishes  if you can imagine. the amount each person got varied slightly but was clearly not a lot because the basic dishes were not that large to begin with. the dishes came out of the kitchen one by one, paced such that we could all discuss and enjoy each one before the next. our favorites were the beet salad fantastic, goat empanadas delicious, pork shank succulent, sauted green beans a little salty, breads especially the peter piper, wood fired lamb ribs, pan fried shishito peppers yes, some were very hot!, grilled pork bellies, tempura walleye and wood oven roasted pig face try it you will like it. we also had all four of their desserts. they have an extensive wine menu. the restaurant is amazingly staffed such that food comes out and then dirty dishes from the previous dishes are removed promptly. it was a wonderful experience and i suggest you give it a try. enjoy!!"
539,Alan H.,1126,5,9/19/18,"simply amazing. arrived for our reservation at  saturday night. it was very crowded and took a bit of time to get seated. atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. service was prompt and friendly. the food came out at a good pace as well. the food was very interesting. there were so many combinations of different foods that most people would never have expected to be paired together, but went together beautifully.  would recommend. items we got included the skuna bay salmon, pan fried shishito peppers vegan, squash blossom crab rangoon, duck tongue, roasted cauliflower, goat liver mousse, goat empanadas , braised beef tongue, and the wood oven roasted pig face, plus  desserts. favorites at our table were the pan fried shishito peppers and the goat liver mousse. while the squash blossom crab rangoon was good and a great concept, it tasted as good as other crab rangoons you can get elsewhere, so i would recommend trying another item on the menu."
540,Scott P.,1126,5,9/11/18,"definitely one of our very favorite restaurants in chicago! truly  star! chef izard does amazing things with each and every item on the menu and not a one was anything less than stellar! my guest and i love to share plates, so this was perfect for this style of enjoying a meal! trevor, our server, was friendly, helpful, attentive, but not overbearing. he was professional and helpful as well! after looking over the wine list we decided to begin with a bottle of the girl & the goat red wine. it had a comfortable price point and for a walla walla cab, it was a solid wine! then we dug in  big time! we began with squash blossoms and the goat empanadas for appetizers. my guest loved the blossoms the best of these two while i thought the empanadas were just a touch higher on the deliciousness scale! they truly reminded me of the empanadas i enjoyed in chile, where i fell in love with them so that is high praise from me! then we got serious! we had the scallops, the walleye, the green beans, and the lamb ribs. each was spectacular and amazing in their own way! truly amazing! each was cooked to perfection and with wonderful seasonings, flavors, and aromas! served hot and with each dish fully explained to us by the server as they each came to our table, in perfect order and not rushed at all. the green beans are something else and out of this world! do not miss them! the scallops were absolutely excellent and then the jackpot arrived  the walleye and the lamb ribs. again my guest and i were split. she said the lamb ribs outranked the walleye by a bit, while i insisted the walleye was a touch above the lamb ribs! if we were not so full by this point we would have had a second order of each just to settle our argument, but instead settled for a very nice cappuccino and an espresso. this is a wonderful eating experience in a great food city so do yourself a true favor and do not miss girl & the goat !"
541,D. L. J.,1126,5,9/10/18,"awesome time cannot wait to go back the next time we are in chicago! chef izard's menu is brimming with interesting options and bold flavors. do not be shy about trying goat ! its taste is not overwhelming, rather similar to lamb. the wood burning oven adds depth. all dishes were balanced and well executed. good wine list that fits the menu and concept. vibe is fun and casual, and the service is awesome. really cannot ask for more! atmosphere  convivial and friendly, the space is casual and relaxed,with rustic design elements and an open kitchen.  bustling, jam packed on a holiday weekend and could be noisy. two tops a bit close to one another.  dress is nicer casual, no need to get super dressed up.  wood burning ovens make it a touch on the warm side in dining room. food so hard to choose from all of the incredible options. flavors are bold but impeccably balanced. dishes are perfect for sharing, and its nice to sample a range of izard's creativity. execution was top notch, truly enjoyed everything. we had  pan fried shishito peppers parmesanÄã, sesame, miso   not particularly noteworthy, but well done nonetheless.  roasted cauliflower pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint   peppers add a nice tangacidity, while the char and smokiness from wood burning oven was excellent.  goat empanadas grilled pineapple pico, roasted poblano cream, queso fresco   salsa lends a nice freshness, well balanced. goat was not overwhelming with all the other ingredients a good choice to try goat if you are hesitant.  goat ribs perilla marinated heirlooms, pickled grape tomato, green plums, tahini yogurt, wood fired pita   amazing, super tender and paired with the yogurt and pita a perfect bite.  wood oven roasted pig face sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red winemaple, potato stix   do not let the name intimidate! it is just roasted pork  no strange textures or sights. the flavors are incredible, especially liked the tamarind and maple which add just a touch of sweetness. beverage wine list had plenty of high quality and reasonably priced offerings. we really loved the  âleve pinot noir  which paired nicely with our goat and pork dishes. did not get a chance to try the cocktails, but there were a number of alluring options for sure. service  our waitress did an awesome job, great with recommendations.  very hospitable and attentive."
542,Mop P.,1126,5,9/2/18,service and food are great. nice cocktail list. selection of food for vegetarians and non veg. we liked the goat empanadas only two in a serving we did not order much but the four of us were surprisingly full quickly.
543,John F.,1126,5,9/1/18,"every meal seems to be original, balanced and delicious! you cannot go wrong with whatever you choose. goat empanadas are a must!"
544,Priscilla C.,1126,5,10/25/18,"as mentioned by the majority, this place is booked up for months but my occasional opentable browsing finally paid off and i was able to snag a reservation for  at pm on a wednesday. our server was super nice! he started off by explaining that the menu is categorized by type fish, veggies, meat, etc. instead of the usual appetizer, entree. he recommended  dishes for  to share and heres what we ordered tempura walleye  fried battered fish .!! fresh, crispy and not greasy at all. the sauce was delicious. it tasted just like vietnamese fish dipping sauce but the addition of gooseberries made it extra special mr. sweet potato bread  could not stop eating! loved the fluffy texture and the savory cream cheese seared scallops  every bite was wonderful and i ate every single thing on that friggin plate! confit goat belly  mega flavorful goat belly topped with scrumptious lobster and crab  need i say more? sticky toffee crunchy cake  luscious texture and i am obsessed with the sour cream ice cream aw honey honey  yep we ordered  desserts, do not judge the sponge was alright but the honey mousse and whip were divine! i do not know how to not abruptly end this review so i am just going to end it by saying, stop reading this review and get yourself a reservation! "
545,Kelley T.,1126,5,10/15/18,"one of the best meals i have had. ever. our server, devon, was just as amazing as the food! she had great recommendations and was unbelievably helpful. bartenders were wonderful while we were waiting as well! our party of  had the cashew green beans, goat belly , lamb ribs, broccoli, duck tartar, and scallops. all of them were absolutely amazing, but the scallops, tartar, and green beans were our favorites. the green beans are one of the top  dishes i think i have ever had anywhere. we were visiting chicago, but this restaurant could just be enough to make us relocate!"
546,Joshua Y.,1126,5,10/12/18,"easily the most memorable meal i have ever had, and quite possibly the best. the only other meals i have had that could compare were at gordon ramsay steak in las vegas and a little place in buffalo called martin cooks which is no longer open, and i think the food here was more creative. first off  call ahead for a table at least  week's ahead of time. i called a little over a month in advance as my wife and i were traveling to chicago for our tenth anniversary, which i did let the staff know when i booked the reservation. the place was packed at  on a thursday. we started with a couple of drinks at the bar. my wife had a very wellmade traditional old fashioned, and i had a slightly more modern gin concoction that was garnished with cinnamon. both were very tasty. the restaurant is pretty well laid out  there is a pretty spacious lounge for waiting, a sizable and well stocked bar, and you can see into the kitchen from practically every table. however, if you are very fortunate, the host will lead you to two bar chairs that directly overlook the grill station in the kitchen  the chef's table. from there, we had a full view of the kitchen and all the food going out, which informed on which dishes we ordered. everything from the grill and oven is woodfired and the chefs in the brigade are on point even during the busiest rush. they do suggest  dishes per person, which are served family style. we settled on duck tongue, the shishito peppers, a grilled broccoli dish, scallops, lamb ribs, and goat belly , and a reasonably priced  bordeaux. the headon branzino and octopus also looked amazing, but we did not try those dishes. everything that came out was  stars. the duck tongue was nice and crispy. the shishito peppers combined with a parmesan cheese crust gave a nice degree of heat that did not overpower the flavor of the peppers and cheese. the grilled broccoli was served over a wonderful tahini yogurt sauce, the scallops were served with this rich oyster sauce that i could have eaten a whole bowl of by itself. the lamb ribs were falling from the bone, and the goat belly was remarkably tender and earthy. we finished off the meal with two terrific desserts a chocolate pavlova with chocolate ice cream and caramel inside the crust, and grape gelato combined with peanut butter cake and cookie crumbs that called to mind the flavors of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. if you love great food, you must eat at this restaurant at least once. although it is tough to get a table at, it is not all that expensive  even with a decent bottle of wine,  dishes and  desserts our total bill was less than ."
547,Krystal R.,1126,5,10/9/18,"lived up to all expectations! make reservations and order and split as many plates as you can.. i do not think any of them could be a let down. we got the pig face, goat belly , & scallops and each dish was unique and delicious. the atmosphere was great.. not too loud & cozy."
548,Kevin H.,1126,5,10/8/18,"i have been waiting years to get back to chicago to try out this gem touted by my friend anthony b. and tonight was the night! we sat at the bar first come first served. you can also reserve a table but when i called  weeks prior, they had already been fully booked for a sunday night! the room was filled with the younger set people aged  and up to s. dress was casual due to the millennial crowd but not pretentious. the bartender was great. we did not order drinks but he gave us suggestions and and recommendations like we were ordering top shelf booze! great staff everywhere! all of them were so incredibly helpful! course # kohlarabi salad with fresh fennel, toasted almonds, roasted shiitake mushrooms, dutch beemster and pears! a unique pairing of flavors both sweet, savory and with a gentle crispness. course # roasted lamb ribs in blueberry tamarind glaze with fresh scallions! it is meat candy at its finest!! after your first bite you will want a huge plate of this stuff! course # wood grilled broccoli with melted smokey bleu cheese and spiced crisped rice! smokey deliciousness! who would have thought broccoli could be healthy and yummy!! course # goat belly confit with bourbon butter, crab & lobster with fresh fennel! i have to admit that i was not sure you could pair surf and turf like this, but omg it was fabulous! sir, i will take ten more of these to go! course # seared diver scallops with wild maitake & wood ear mushrooms in an oyster sauce brodo with a squash brandade! again, a culinary masterpiece! i always like to have a sweet finish. but there were two desserts i had to do and i figured i would let them each duke it out for the honor of being number one! it was a tie dessert # sponge cake with a gooseberry shortbread crumble, honey mousse, whipped cream and gastriqu! dessert # homemade malted vanilla ice cream with caramel corn and crispy chocolate she will! omg fantastic! i just died and went to a gastronomical heaven!!"
549,Olivia M.,1126,5,10/4/18,"oh my gosh, what a wonderful meal! my husband and i finally used a gift card we had received for this restaurant and it was such an enjoyable experience. the server was so great, really helped with giving us recommendations. everything is shared, they recommend  plates per person. we decided on bread, green beans, salmon, oven roasted pig face, confit goat belly , and caramel corn malt balls to top it all off. seriously, everything i ate was delicious. i think my favorites were the salmon, it definitely was way better than it is described on the menu, and the confit goat belly , which was rich and decadent. i left extremely full and extremely satisfied. highly recommend!"
550,Jeff B.,1126,5,9/25/18,"awesome dining experience. the pork shank was tremendous and delicious. also liked the walleye which was fried with tempura battercrispy outside and warm tender inside. they recommended  dishes per person so we ordered all the seafood dishes and some other meats. the goat belly was ok, but a little gamey. they also made birthday cookies for sister in law. overall awesome place and food."
551,Julie M.,1126,5,9/9/18,"girl in the goat was highly anticipated dinner that we planned three weeks in advance. i recommend making reservations as early as possible, the earliest we could get in was  pm. it was still buzzing when we got there. sidenote the food scene in chicago was nothing less than amazing and girl and the goat blew our mind. we wanted to try as many dishes as possible so we went all out and splurged. starting with the ratatouille focaccia with baba ganoush and squash tzatziki looking back now we probably did not need the bread but it was warm and delicious in the dipping sauce. we had the sauted green beans which were rich in flavor. the confit goats belly melted in our mouths with the bourbon butter and lobster and crab, this was a favorite! the pork shank was my husbands favorite and one of the most substantial of the plates. of course we had to try the wood oven roasted pig face and this was my favorite. another melt in your mouth dish and the sunny side egg on top, yoke dripping over pork just sent my taste buds over the edge. we also had a seasonal dish of calamari that was great. we had a great experience there. it was already after midnight when we were finishing up but the wait staff was still actively bringing out food. our waiter was so good at explaining each dish that came out as well as the ingredients that were used. we could see the chefs through the open kitchen concept which i really enjoyed. if i was to go back to chicago, handsdown i would return to girl & the goat . if i am being honest, i would say it is a selling point for a trip alone."
552,Emil G.,1126,3,9/8/18,"it is good but overpriced. one or two of the dishes we had we great roasted beets, but most were just average or poor  goat belly . servings are small. overall, the food is really fatty. it was worth it for one special occasion as a bucketlist kind of thing, but not someplace i would return."
553,Sarah H.,1126,5,9/2/18,"we checked out the girl and the goat while visiting chicago from texas. we thankfully made reservations a few weeks in advance, as they were very busy even on a tuesday night. they recommended ordering at least two plates per person, which ended up being a perfect amount of food. we tried the goat belly , duck tongues, branzino, and pigs head, all of which were divine. the best bite we had was definitely the goat belly with a little bit of the lobstercrab topping. everything was cooked prefectly. if we had one recommendation for improvement, it would be timing. we received several plates very quickly, and then waited what seemed like a very long time between our third and fourth plates. this did not diminish our experience at all, but it seemed incongruous with the rest of the evening. overall, we would highly recommend."
554,Addison P.,1126,4,8/27/18,"ordered roasted cauliflower sauteed green beans soft she will crab cake wood oven roasted pig face crisp braised pork shank confit goat belly pan roasted halibut caramel corn & malt balls our favorites were the crab cake and the pork shank. order more naan for the pork shank. it is not enough and the meat is so fatty, it is not good to eat it by itself. overall it was a good meal but not earth shattering good."
555,Gigi M.,1126,5,8/26/18,"this place was absolutely amazing. i did not have reservations but my partner and i found a seat right away at the bar. there we were greeted by jason who was very knowledgeable in the menu and gave us some great options. for starters we had the goat liver moose delicious, then the corn perogies favorite, confit goat belly amazing, sauted green beans on the house, and the crisp braised pork shank. the liver moose was very good and filling, so i would not recommend if you are getting many items like this. by the end of the moose dish we were pretty full. the perogies were so good. honestly the best i have ever had, cooked to perfection with a latin spin to them. the confit goat belly had a butterscotch flavor to it that made the entire dish, i mean it was just perfect. we were surprised when a server came by and dropped off the green beans dish on the house. the green beans were the best green beans i have ever had. the fish sauce was perfect and not too overbearing, and the green beans were cooked perfectly. lastly we had the pork shank. this was a large plate and we were so full that we had to take most of it to go. honestly it was my least favorite dish, but it was still really good and cooked perfectly. jason was such an amazing server bartender. all the options he gave us did not disappoint and he checked up on us at appropriate times where we did not feel forgotten or too pushed. honestly great service! his drinks were also top notch. it was nice having conversation with fabian as well. just very polite gentlemen, good service, and great food. i plan on becoming a regular here. such an amazing first visit!!!!"
556,An D.,1126,5,8/21/18,culinary genius!! the pairings of flavors are so inventive  unmatched!!! my favorite dish were the scallops and sausage and my fianc drooling over the goat belly ! cannot wait to make it back to chicago and go back. make a rezzy like a month in advance  pro tip!! i ate in the lounge called every day for weeks and nothing but i was really just happy to be there so did not mind the lounge at all !
557,Stephanie B.,1126,4,8/20/18,"while researching for our long weekend in chicago this restaurant came up almost every time and i am so glad we were able to go. we were celebrating our th wedding anniversary and this was our dinner out. we ordered several dishes, hamachi crudo, squash blossom rangoon, duck tongues, goat carpaccio, and goat belly . the only negative i had on any of the dishes was the squash blossom rangoon really needed salt and of course at this level of restaurant there is not any on the table. the almonds it came with had no salt as well, so this did not really help. however, this was my only criticism. my favorite was the goat belly . it is served with bourbon butter and crab and lobster. i was almost disappointed that i had to share it with my husband as i could have easily eaten it all myself. we finished with the chocolate pavlova and the caramel corn and malt balls. i think it says a lot about a restaurant when they spend just as much attention on dessert as the main meal. i could not decide which dessert was better and my husband and i were scraping the bowls at the end. just as i found this restaurant researching i will be sure to recommend it to any of my friends visiting the area."
558,Lin Lin P.,1126,5,8/12/18,"damn. dude. wow. this place. is really good. note it is smaller portions but each dish is incredibly rich and packed with flavor. best dishes were definitely the pigs face and lamb ribs in blueberrytamarind glaze. serious kudos to the chef who came up with the pigs face. ingenious mix of textures and flavors. lamb ribs  pieces per order man, so juicy and falloffthebone. the glaze was superb. so savory, the perfect balance of sweetness and char. we also got the halibut, goat belly , and duck tongue. all were delicious. next top by a small margin for me was the halibut. great flavor and also was a good break from the richness of all the other dishes. then goat belly . boy, this dish is super rich. amazing punches of flavors. each bite is an experience. as for drinks. i got the charles gray and absolutely loved it. not too sweet with a flavor depth that hits your whole mouth. my friends got the spritz. highly recommend for whoever loves grapefruit citrus drinks. highlander was also good. in all, this place lives up to the hype one of the best restaurants in chicago."
559,Savanna M.,1126,5,8/10/18,"two nights in chicago means having to squeeze in all your foodie goals. girl & the goat was very high on my list, but i made it a second dinner for a sunday evening. big mistake, i was really too full to enjoy anything, but the bites i had were way better than dinner #! our reservation was for pm on a sunday night. we arrived about  minutes early and our table was not ready, so managed to squeeze in at the bar and dined there instead. i do not know much about the work culture or work schedules in chicago, but i was really shocked to see just how packed this place was late on a sunday night, definitely different from fort lauderdale. we both started with cocktails, my hubby ordered for me while i was in the restroom, so i forget the name, but it was mezcal based and right up my alley. after some time we were able to order food bartender seemed not as friendly as i would have liked. i knew ahead of time from studying the menu that i had to try the pierogies and goat carpaccio and left enough room in my stomach for about  bite of each lol. truly wish i had more room those, these were both fantastic i would definitely get them again. my hubby seemed to leave more room and insisted he try the beef cheeks and lobster with goat belly , both which he said were very good! a different atmosphere than i was expecting especially after eating at little goat , this place is dark and intimate with a vintage feel, almost like a speak easy. loved it for sure. absolutely amazing meal and i would highly recommend getting a reservation early!!"
560,Matt W.,1126,5,10/28/18,"truly one of the greatest culinary experiences of my life. stephanie izard is a goddess!! watching her expedite throughout the evening just goes to show the dedication she has for her work. service was great our server was owen  food, flawless. we had the raw oysters, duck tongues, chickpea fritters , tempura walleye, green beans, octopus, pig face, chocolate pavlova and toffee cake. raw oysters were the perfect start to the meal. duck tongues were super fun, fresh and bright w the poke, the tongues reminded me of fried chicken skin. the carrot hummus with the chickpea fritter was my boyfriend's favorite part of the evening. tempura walleye's sauce underneath the crispy fish was lickthebowlworthy. green beans were lit. first time ever having octopus  a party to the face. the flavors were loud and i was living. the pig face meat itself reminded me of scrapple but, like, way better than scrapple lol and the sauces were bright and colorful and the egg was perfect. dessert was unreal. we should have ordered all . we had the cocktails it is always sunny in oaxaca, ring of fire, chaitown and fireside. all great, but fireside was definitely the best of the . thank you stephanie and co for helping me give my bf the best birthday dinner i could have ever asked for. will be back again."
561,Kathryn E.,1126,5,10/12/18,"if i could give this place  out of  stars, i would. it was just that good. when you walk in, the ambiance is cool and inviting. modern and clean. somewhat dark but not too dark. dress is nice but casual. the dinner plates are small, so between  of us, we ordered twenty things! we were super full and had some to take home, but each thing we ordered was amazing! for appetizers we ordered the roasted beets  awesome! the chickpea fritters  they tasted amazing but there were only two small fritters  not much food for the  price. everyone raves about the green beans. my brotherinlaw loved them, but i thought they tasted a little too salty from the fish oil or soy sauce. plus, they had cashews and i am not a cashew fan. they were good but not great. we also ordered the pan fried peppers  really good! for entrees we ordered the halibut  one of my favorite things of the night. it was a party in my mouth! seared scallops  not a fan of scallops, i do not like the texture, but the food around it was good. pig face  uhmazing! like bacon and eggs but  times better! grilled chicken  fabulous! pork shank  ooohhhh sooo good! goat loin  first time i have ever had goat meat and it was amazing! i loved how it was prepared with a little tahini yogurt and delicious little pitas! yum!!!! seriously some of the best food i have ever tasted!! you must go here! now i need to try her other restaurants!!!"
562,Sophia L.,1126,4,10/2/18,"i would say this place is a bit too hyped and i debated between  or  stars. gave it  stars since i only tried it once and maybe i ordered too muchgot full of the first items considering i dined alone here. i ordered the chickpea fritters , pig face, and these dumpling things. i thought the fritters were good but nothing to write home about. i found the pig face too salty  too heavy for me, but this was also one of the dishes that came out last. the dumplings were also good but i thought the chickpea fritters were more interesting. i would consider trying this place again with a larger party so i can try more items. the cocktails were fine, but considering i had just come from the aviary, it is hard for any cocktail to measure up."
563,Paula K.,1126,5,8/29/18,"make your reservation now! we luckily got a two person reservation a week out but the next reservations were three plus weeks away. the place has an open kitchen and they seated us right in front of the activity. they have two twoseat tables facing the kitchen and would highly recommend asking if you can reserve those because we loved watching the food being cooked and the crazy action. we started with the chickpea fritter chaat  the chickpea fritters were really nicely fried while still being light. then we got the grilled pork belly which was amazing and a must order! the pork belly was crisp while the bok choy and bean sprouts had some type of lime vinaigrette that added an amazing citrus punch to the dish. next we got the calamari bruschetta which was another star!! the calamari melts in your mouth and pairs perfectly with the bread spread with goat cheese. then we had the goat empanadas  empanadas sometimes get dry in the filling but these were perfect and had subtle but great flavor. for our last entree, we got the pig face  the dish is super interesting. the pork is fatty and amazingly soft and the sauce is almost syrupy and slightly peppery. lastly for dessert we had the chocolate pavlova  at this point, we were stuffed and probably should have gotten the lighter berry dessert but no regrets! i am not a big fan of meringue, but the caramel brittle and sesame ice cream pulled everything together. my favorite dishes were the pork belly and calamari bruschetta but everything was seriously amazing. also the service was five stars too  our waiter was super attentive and our water was never less than half full. this place deserves all the hype and more!"
564,Kimberly D.,1126,5,8/28/18,"it was everything i expected it to be! i hated the waitgot there at  and i was told we would have a seat until after pm or pm. however, my friend and i were lucky to grab seats at the bar. my advice to you is to try to do the same if you wind up in the same situation. the bartender was wonderful! he thoroughly explained the menu and helped us to select the perfect pairings. chickpea fritter chaat =delicious halibut=delicious gluten free bread=the absolute best!!! my friend had the pig face and kohlrabi salad and loved it. she was surprised she like the pig face so much...said it tasted like breakfast. ha!  we have no complaints on food. and will definitely visit again when we take a trip to chicago."
565,F D.,1126,5,8/9/18,"absolutely wonderful. after dying to try this place for  years, i finally got a reservation, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait! this is a culinary experience like no other. we explored the menu and tried sweet corn pierogies chickpea fritter chaat goat empanadas wood fired lamb ribs grilled pork belly bread forgot the kind wsalmon cream cheese chocolate pavlova the waitress gave us a complimentary side of the green beans, very good. my only critique is that the lamb ribs were  fat, no meat. we told the waitress, and she very kindly comped them and gave us more empanadas instead  liked that! everything was a wonderland of flavors. if this place is not on your list, it should be!!!!!"
566,Alex M.,1126,5,8/7/18,"this place is incredible. i finally was able to get a reservation at  last friday, and after one visit, it has instantly climbed to the top of my list in not only chicago, but also nationwide. . stars on  reviews speaks for itself in the yelp universe. you have to have a reservation if you want a table here, and likely will have to make that reservation weeks in advance if you plan on coming on a weekend. wait times exceed  hours, as this restaurant is situated on randolph street in the insanely popular west loop neighborhood in chicago, which is quickly becoming one of the culinary capitals of the country. they are neighbors with the notorious au cheval amongst others. from what i understand, the bar is first come, first serve, and you can order from the full menu here if you are willing to hawk seats. stephanie izard has been getting a lot of press recently, and in my opinion, she deserves even more. i cannot emphasize how pleased i was with this meal. i had done a fair amount of research on yelp beforehand, so i had a pretty good idea of the fan favorites. dress is very casual as well, which is an added bonus. after about a minute wait, we were seated and ordered a bottle of white wine, which was reasonably priced. they also comped us some focaccia for not having our table ready when we were seated. i am allergic to shrimp, so we steered clear of all shellfish dishes, but here are my lessthan definitive rankings of everything we ordered favorite to least roasted cauliflower pan roasted halibut sauted green beans blueberry bourbon baba grilled pork belly chickpea fritter chaat ratatouille focaccia skuna bay salmon braised beef tongue wood fired lamb ribs i would highly recommend you get at least everything up until the focaccia. seriously do not skip the cauliflower... even if you do not like vegetables. i could eat this all day. the salmon and beef tongue were pretty average in my opinion, though my friends raved about the salmon. the only dish i did not care much for was the ribs, but these came secondtolast, and i was pretty full at this point. they are a bit fatty, so it really depends how you like your meat. my friend said this was his favorite dish. this was more than enough food for the  of us, and we all had arrived extremely hungry. i know that the goat empanadas, scallops, squash blossom rangoon and crab cakes are also really popular. gives good reason to return. as if this place was not already spectacular, the service was stellar we left well over  for tip, as they were really diligent all night. our waiter also sequenced our food out, as we ordered all at once, which demonstrated the expertise  knowledgeability of the waitstaff here. there was  of us dining, and all said, even with the wine and dessert, this meal came out to under   person, which is incredible for a meal of this caliber. a, would give  stars if i could, and you are almost certain to love, regardless of your demographic. concurrently a great place for any kind of date, but you should not feel guilty coming in with kids either. fingers crossed that izard  co. will get the praise they so deserve from the folks over at michelin next year."
567,Jennifer P.,1126,5,7/10/18,"this was the highlight of our chicago trip, and my favorite meal out of all the places we dined at. we spent a lot, but a lot of it was due more to the drinks those added up quickly at  apiece. all in all, we spent  on drinks and  on food, lol. the drinks were oddly the only part i did not enjoy. i tried bananas in cabanas and the spritz, but ended up preferring my water... my husband ended up getting  ring of fires  so i think it is safe to say he enjoyed his drinks more! we lucked out and ended up having amazing seats right by the kitchen. we were able to watch every dish being made, and it was such a treat!  even though we had ordered our food already based on our server's recommendations, everything looked delicious and we were second guessing if we should have ordered...well... everything! we ordered the homemade sweet onion brioche with smoked salmon cream cheese and pickle relish from their sister restaurant across the street, goat empanadas, grilled pork belly, and woodfired lamb ribs. they must have liked our reactions because they also gave us a chickpea fritter chaat on the house! that carrot hummus was great, and melissa gave us the great tip of using it on our homemade brioches too.  all were excellent, but oh.my .god. the lamb ribs... this was our our finale and it was the most soft, succulent, and flavorful lamb i have had in my entire life. if we were not so stuffed, we would have ordered it again. to give you an idea of how good... i would return to chicago just for this dish again. if you get one dish, let this is the one. if you are not sure if you like lamb... this would be the creme de la creme to figure that out. if you do not like this? you do not like lamb. from our seats, we could easily see that this place was a welloiled machine and had their techniques down pat  whether it be melissa on dessert, jasmine on salads, or eli on the empanadas nada!... it was truly watching artists at work. they were so meticulous about plating, and the service staff were also impressive and helping to set up as well.  they were a great team, helping each other during the hectic dinner rush. at one point, a waiter had about  desserts on his tray i was truly afraid for him but he balanced that thing as if it were nothing! we truly enjoyed the camaraderie of the staff. seeing melissa, eli, and jasmine keep their cool in the pressures of crowded, insanely busy kitchen, but still finding the joy in what they do and taking hilarious jabs at each other made it such a fun experience. we also had the inside scoop on what melissa thought were the best desserts who would know better than the dessert chef!?. she recommended the matl balls and the seasonal rhubarb pie, and even let us know we could order miniversions since we were so full but wanted to try both. we never would have thought to have tried the rhubarb pie, but we are so glad we did. it was even better than the malt balls and i heartily recommend it if you have the chance. if only i could do my  day chicago trip over! i would have come here and try different menu items  the lamb ribs at least three times! this place is worth every penny. if you visit chicago, make it a point to go here!"
568,Elwood P. D.,1126,4,7/7/18,"it was late and we were looking for a bite when we stumbled into g&tg. the patio was closed so we sat at the bar and were treated to one of the most professional experiences we have had in chicago. the bartender was very knowledgeable of the whiskies and he explained in detail the order of business as to their small plate offerings. this is a small plate restaurant and for us it was perfect for our late nite dining. we ordered three plates and that was enough for us to share. the green garlic pierogies were tasty raviolis delicately laced with smoked tomato relish....after enjoying this treat we were anxiously awaiting the next dish which was... the chickpea fritter . i am not a big fan of feta but in this case it perfectly matched the chickpeas adding a creaminess that was unexpected. then came the... goat shank. a surprising amount of meat, tender and inviting. we cleaned the bones on this one. the reason only  stars is because of the price. we understand the cost of doing business is high in this part of the world but this place was expensive for our rural northwestern budget. having said that, if money is not an issue you will have no problem enjoying what g&tg has to offer."
569,Mike R.,1126,5,6/17/18,"my wife and i took a long weekend trip to chicago for some dining and sight seeing. monteverde & alinea were the first two places to visit, and we could not see how things could get better. along comes girl and the goat, and things got even better. most enjoyable meal of the trip, even though the only reservation we could get was  pm kind of an early dinner i guess. space was comfortable, service very friendly and knowledgeable, but the food was the bomb!! started with the oyster combo of wood fired and fried oysters. best fried oysters ever. crispy coating, flavorful oysters and great dipping sauce. server delivered a complimentary order of the chickpea fritters . thoughtful and tasty. the entrees we chose were the halibut with blueberry nuoc cham as well as the crisp braised pork shank. both were  star entrees. the halibut perfectly cooked with an asian flare. the pork was very flavorful and served with an excellent naan bread. we had to get something from the goat portion of the menu, and chose the empanadas. i loved them, but my wife felt they were a little gamey for her taste. we had the caramel corn and malt balls for dessert.  addicting!! highly recommend girl and the goat!! work on your reservation well in advance however."
570,Kate T.,1126,5,6/16/18,"anytime i am in chicago, girl & the goat is one of the first stops that i make and now that i live here i will be frequenting it much more often! definitely make a reservation well in advance  it is packed every night of the week so while you can get full service at the bar, it is unlikely you will find a spot if you just walk in during prime dinner hours. we had a few of the staples but tried a few new dishes as well. always get the fried oysters, pig face and the green beans. we also tried the green onion pierogies, lamb ribs and the chickpea fritter . all were delicious and beautifully presented! waitstaff is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. you can tell there is a mentality of every table being important to every server as opposed to just their section. they truly work as a team to make sure your experience is seamless and you are never left wanting for anything. our server in particular was super patient, kind and willing to answer questions and make recommendations. she even sent the chickpea fritter to the table as a gift to welcome me to the city when i told her that i just moved to chicago. only thing to note is that girl & the goat is very loud. it is not overwhelming but conversation is pretty difficult if you are not sitting right next to the person you are talking to. if you are trying to have a conversation over dinner and do not want to yell, i would ask to sit on the outside patio assuming the weather is nice of course.  would recommend. if you are in chicago for any length of time girl & the goat is a must try."
571,Michelangelo V.,1126,3,6/9/18,"honest review hit n miss good food but not the best food i ever had prolly would not come back due to the hassle of getting a seat think if they were open even earlier it would make it less crowded they have to accommodate the crowd in some way make recommendations or come on a weekday at  you can sit at the bar or eat at the waiting area otherwise you will wait  hours second time coming here first review still relevant because most of the dishes have not changed since i been here so read both. service whenever there are more then  hostess beware for snotty bad service like why do you need  hostesses. the servers gave good recommendations they said the ingredients they refilled ur water n they were so kind loved it but it gets kind of sluggish when it gets supper crowded and when they want you to leave. the best things were the duck tongues halibut beef tongue whole branzino pigface chickpea fritter  empanada chocolate pavlova lemon cake i think if they cut the menu down from like  pages to  n jus focused on like  dishes this restaurant would make better food n be more consistent like plz shorten the menu n update the menu the same things from like years ago are still on the menu wish the dishes she made on iron chef would be on the menu also fix desserts their basic in flavor chickpea fritter chaat  not the best chaat i ever had was expecting more spices but really tasty. the fritters were amazing supper crispy yet light just put more  was not enough their that good. the carrot humus was really good loved the sweetness wish there was a lil heat to off set it. loved the pickles strawberries adds acidity my only complaint it needs salt so add capers or something salty goat empanadas  i usually do not like empanadas because their not complex but this was really flavorful. the empanada was really crunchy and not greasy the aioli was really flavorful wish there was more. loved the veggies on top for freshness my complaint is i wanted more blue cheese i love blue cheese n would have loved blue cheese on top instead of queso fresco im mexican n hate that cheese it has no flavor to it calamari bruschetta  worst dish of the nite. its a very bland dish and the goat cheese and calamari do not go together at all. the bread was amazing and the goat cheese was really good. the bacon was terrible because it was not crispy it was flabby and soggy like they boiled it. the green tomatoes did not work at all do not know why it was there. its also hard to eat the dish very messy beef tongue  best dish of the nite. the salad on top with the sweet sauce was to die for put more. then the beef tongue was tender and crispy. the salsa verde was really fresh like a pesto. loved the pickled onions for acidity the issue was the masa their way to big and to thick make them smaller wood fired whole branzino  amazing fish was really crispy and seasoned just take out the gills plz that is like common knowledge n wish it was a more unique fish. the papaya salad is what makes the dish it adds so much flavor and texture. the broth is good just do not put to much tomato in it wish it was thicker to . if there was bread, rice or noodles would really bring everything together pig face   its like everything you want for breakfast all in one dish amazing the pig face is supper crispy the fries add texture the maple syrup with the pork is the best combination the aioli is to die for. the egg was overcooked though and they do not put enough of the sauces it needs a lot of tje maple syrup and a lot of the aioli to make the dish work i would ask for extra maple syrup and aioli on the side goat neck  was good not great idk if it was the yogurt or the beans but that was the only thing with flavor the goat is tender but not flavorful just was expecting more chocolate pavlova  tasty its not to sweet the black sessame makes it taste like popcorn the meringue was crispy. if i had any complaints it would be to put a lil salt or chili for complexity. the desserts biggish so it does need more icecream lemon pound cake  amazing i do not like lemon or acidic food but this was really good. it was not to acidic which i loved the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness wish the cake was moister but loved the crispy sugar on top. the icecream was amazing but was to hard and not enough"
572,Jiahui L.,1126,5,6/8/18,"this might be my favorite restaurant in chicago. i have come here almost every time i have visited, and i have never been disappointed. there are so many reviews already, so i will keep it short. favorites soft she will crab on scallion pancake and blackberries, chickpea fritters how is it perfectly crisp and creamy smooth?!, the jam cocktail despite the name not super sweet, very funky, any of the seasonal desserts lemon pound cake with sorrel ice cream this trip. every item is well crafted and delicious, and the above just scratches the surface of its offerings. service is always very kind and generous. i have walked in without reservations with max of  people and usually get seats at the bar any time between pm. plus of sitting at the bar is that the bartenders are amazing and very fun, you can order mini size plates of all the veg items so you can do a little tasting, especially if you are eating by yourself. cannot wait for our next trip back!"
573,Jennifer L.,1126,4,5/23/18,"the menu is unique. i do not really eat goat but theirs were great. lots iof interesting options. i took out one star because everything came out all at once squeezed onto our tiny table, which was extremely crowded. plus the food got cold by the time we could eat them. pork shank became really dry instead of crispy and moist when we had our first bite. my favorites were duck tongues, chickpea fritters and goat carpaccio. green garlic pierogies, sweet onion brioche smoked salmon cream cheese, goat empanadas were decent. caramel corn & malt balls were too salty for me. our server informed the table next to us they could order smaller portion instead of the regular dinner plates. i wish she told us that while we ordered. we told her we wanted to try a lot of the dishes on the menu but could not possibly eat that much and ended having lots of leftovers."
574,Linda B.,1126,5,5/12/18,"great vibe. amazing service. the food is so creative and bursting with flavor. the chickpea fritters were moist with a light exterior crispness. we ordered  plates and  desserts, which was too much for the  of us but we wanted to try a variety of dishes things we have never cooked. escargot ravioli, tongue, branzino. all were cooked to perfection with various sauces and vegetables. our server also brought out complementary empanadas that were delicious. chocolate meringue with ice cream, lemon pound cake with sorel ice cream and a complementary rhubarb crisp. if you are a foodie you need to eat here. you will not be disappointed. our bill which included  glasses of wine totaled  not including tip. very reasonable for what you get."
575,Jessica N.,1126,4,5/8/18,"what a delicious meal on my first night during a weekend trip in chicago!?! stephanie izard, top chef winner and chicago native, has outdone herself with an innovative menu of family style small platestapas with bold flavors and mediterranean influence. whether you are an adventurous eater, ready to indulge in duck toungues, roasted pig face, and goat empanadas or you love more traditional fare such as succulent ramp marinated chicken, tender baby short ribs, and sauted green beans, girl and the goat has something delicious for everyone. a dining experience at girl and the goat, located in the trendy west loop, is highly coveted, so make sure to make a reservation well in advance. we made our reservation a few months in advance on opentable. initially there were only reservations available at  pm on thursday, however we checked back and reservations opened up. we ended up making a reservation at  pm on thursday. they were very busy but we were seated quickly. there are plenty of tables throughout the restaurant and also communal style seating on a long booth in the center of the restaurant, which is where we were seated. the server explained the menu, that a group of two diners typically orders four to six dishes to be shared and that the dishes would be served starting with the lightest and ending with heaviest. some dishes can also be served as half orders which was advantageous for myself since my dining companion has an aversion to seafood while i love it and wanted to try a little bit of everything. most dishes range from  a piece. the goat empanadas, piqued our interest and we were so glad we ordered these as they were one of our favorite items that we tried here. the goat empanadas were served as two, with misoblue alioli, chanterelle mushrooms and apple giardiniera. the sauce was so flavorful and the goat meat was tender and delicious. if you have never consumed goat meat before, it is almost reminiscent of pulled pork, very tender, flavorful, and delicious. next up were the chickpea fritters , served with quinoa tabbouleh, chickpeas , pomegranate seeds, feta, and a tahini vinaigrette. the combination of flavors was amazing. the fritter had a polenta or tofu like texture. the sauce was delicious. next we had the green garli pierogies, served with a scallion sour cream, and tomato rhubarb relish, very tasty. service has the illusion of being attentive as there were certain employees throughout the restaurant who is only responsibility was keeping everyone's water glass filled and plateware and utensils fresh and clean. however, our main waiter never came back and checked on us throughout the entire meal after the first initial order taking, even though he checked on the family next to us several times. i had to wave him down to add a couple seafood dishes to the order and a cocktail. i ordered the fried oysters. they were delicious! if you have never had fried oysters, i would equate them to the flavor and texture of a fried mushroom. i also had a half order of scallops, which was one scallop, since my friend does not like seafood. the scallop was garnished with brown butter alioli, blood orange, smoked beet, and pistachios. the flavors and garnishing was great but i actually thought the scallop was slightly undercooked. next up were the crispy beef short ribs, my other favorite menu item, served with avocado and grapefruit. the meat was melt in your mouth tender...so delicious. finally we were served the ramp marinated grilled chicken, a very generous portion, large enough to be a meal of its own, served with shaved carrots, red peppers, and spicy peanut crunch. bonein chicken was fall off the bone tender and the combination of flavors was unique and delicious. i also really enjoyed the cocktail that i ordered, it is always sunny in oaxaca, mezcal, mango, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne...subtly spicy and very tasty. i would definitely order this again. a couple next to us ordered the pork shank, a very large generous portion, served with pita bread and various dipping sauces which looked and smelled amazing. i will definitely be ordering the pork shank upon my next visit. the family next to us, was offered a complimentary dessert by our same waiter, even though they said they were too full. however, we were not offered a complimentary dessert. it seemed like when i had inquired about half orders, in regards to seafood, that our waiter toned down the service which does not seem right since we spent  on our total bill between the two of us. if we had been checked on at least once throughout our entire visit, my review would have been  stars. despite the service, the food was innovative, unique, and delicious and i would still return. i would love to try some of the adventurous menu items like duck tongue, escargot ravioli, and pig face during my next visit. girl and the goat is a dining must during any chicago visit."
576,narissa n.,1126,5,10/18/18,oystersraw. confit duck belly. roasted cauliflower . lamb ribs. whole branzino. malt chocolate ice cream with caramel popcorn. you are welcome.
577,Chris H.,1126,5,8/24/18,"where do i start? the food was amazing, there were  of us, so our server suggested  dishes. we had duck tongue halibut squash blossom crab rangoon the bread lamb ribs roasted cauliflower roasted shishito peppers the duck tongue was brought out for free as it was late in the night and we had asked about it, but did not end up ordering. let me tell you! this was the star, holy cow, it was really good and easily the best dish we tried. the squash blossom crab rangoon was amazing and easily the best crab rangoon i have ever had, and i love crab rangoon. amazing they even asked if we wanted to add a third as there was  of us, but the dish only came with  roasted cauliflower was excellent lamb ribs were good, but i would have ordered something a bit more complex for the main protein. halibut was not my favorite dish, but my two friends thoroughly enjoyed. the bread was good, it was baked with corn but the name is escaping me. the shishito peppers were not good. they were definitely the spiciest of the variety i have ever had and the flavors were not there. i would pass on this dish. we also had  deserts but they were nothing to write home about. cocktails were excellent."
578,Dina M.,1126,5,7/30/18,"it seems as though everyone and their mother recommended this place for dinner. so on our first night out in chicago this was a must. i am a huge stephanie izzard fan. first of all the bartender not only knew how to make our favorite drink but made it perfectly so yourself a favor and try a paperplane we started off with the pan fried shishito peppers beautiful flavor goat empanadas yum, roasted cauliflower lovely, the halibut really delicious flavor combination, lamb ribs  insanely tender. and we still had room for dessert..shocker i know. lol we had the popcorn and malt balls, fantastic just like the rest of the meal."
579,Alanoud A.,1126,2,7/14/18,"food looked nice as an exotic plate but not delicious! the only thing i thought that was delicious is the lamb ribs otherwise not worth the money. the menue is neither simple ,easy to read nor understand. what my husband & i had were  olive bread nice & the spread of butter was ok  roasted beans it was actually burned with parmesan on top  roasted cauliflower  it was good compared to the one mentioned. i actually liked it but would not imagine myself craving for it & reordering it again  lamb ribs delicious!"
580,Casey Z.,1126,5,6/30/18,"wow. i will say i am typically never a fan of expensive small plates but girl and the goat was an exception. we were a group of  definitely get reservations ahead of time and ordered  dishes waitress recommended  dishes per person but we like to eat. i am not a big goatlambmeat in general fan so i will give my take on my favorites but pretty much everything we ate was raves about. from the breads section, get the sweet onion brioche. that relish is bomb and the salmon cream cheese was a subtle touch. i hate olives so the olive bread was not for me but if you like a strong olive flavor, check it out. from the vegetarian section, i recommend the green beans, cauliflower , and pierogis. i absolutely hate it when restaurants make vegetables bland but this was not the case here. everything was packed with flavor and had multiple components that somehow all worked beautifully together. roasted cauliflower was the best from this section. beet salad could be skipped. i love seafood so i liked everything we tried from the fish section  calamari be warned it is not fried, crab rangoon, and halibut. the halibut has a nice sear to it and worked well with the mushrooms. the creamy squash in the rangoon was a creative and delicious twist. the bruschetta underneath the calamari was bomb. from the meat section, the winner from everyone else at the table was the lamb ribs. the pork shank was tender and the naan was great if it came fresh from the oven. the pig face was like a breakfast dish and was ok, and the grilled chicken had a nice rub to it. from the goats section, the goat empanadas were deemed alright. apparently the meat was ok but the empanada she will was tasty. the goat belly was pretty meh and also took a while to come out of the kitchen so we were all pretty stuffed by the end. what sets girl and the goat apart from the other expensive tapas style restaurants i typically hate is the service. maybe it is because we were such a large and expensive party, but we got the olive bread on the house. when the goat belly took too long to get to our table, the waitress gave it to us free of charge. then we had some issues with how hot the restaurant was heat wave in chicago today and had asked the waitress if there was a way to cool it down there was not but she brought lots of ice to us, she politely explained the situation and then gave us two free desserts on the house to make up for the heat. this is service i rarely see these days and i was very impressed. i will definitely be back the next time i am in chicago to try out the rest of the delicious menu"
581,Julia S.,1126,5,6/24/18,"service  ambiance  food most of the time  but occasionally to my taste . this is arguably among the most wellknown restaurants in chicago, and reservations are fairly hard to come by, so definitely try to make the reservation  months ahead of time, when the reservations open up on opentable. i had a party of , and even though we made the reservation pretty far ahead in advance, the only time slot available was for pm. still a reasonable time and we happily took it. highly recommend for large parties  calling ahead and ordering the goat leg. the goat leg is usually  pounds, and costs pound. the restaurant says it will feed up to  people. with some additional veggie dishes and between seven people, we ate about  of it. not sure how far in advance this call needs to be made we called about  hours ahead of time but the way that the bone cleanly fell out tells me that it must have been cooked or soaked for hours. even my picky asian grandmother was loving the delicious, meltinyourmouth goat meat! our waitress recommended that we order some vegetables in addition to our goat leg, so we got two orders of the shishito peppers and two orders of the roasted cauliflower . the shishito peppers must have been topped in a lot of cheese and then baked, and was not my favorite dish because of the richnesssaltiness. i typically prefer the clean taste of vegetables, maybe with a little added. i have been to girl & the goat before, and had a similar experience with the broccoli. it was placed on a bed of creamcheese and i found it a little rich and overthetop. on the other hand, the cauliflower was delicious!! light and perfectly cooked, this is my favorite roasted cauliflower i have ever had."
582,Rebecca C.,1126,4,6/12/18,". stars for being inventive here. hip ambience at this top chef restaurant. the lighting was a bit too dark for me. i would recommend getting half portions whenever possible eg. ravioli, cauliflower , shishito pepper to try the maximum amount of dishes here. must have duck tongues with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, piri piri  this dish was phenomenal. never thought that fried duck tongue would go with tuna but it does! great balanced of flavors and textures. do not get scared of duck tongues which were deep fried and little bites mixed into the entire dish. solid roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint  the cauliflower is a bit over cooked but really liked the pickled spicy pepper here, which saved the dish. they doused it in parmagiano cheese which was not indicated on the menu. i would have preferred it without it. they should have indicated it on the menu so people can opt out. escargot ravioli  bacon tamarind sauce, escarole and celery, crispy & carmelized onions. interesting dish. liked the caramelized onion in this dish. the sauce was a bit too salty. skip pan fried shishito peppers  parmesan, sesame, miso. this dish was trying to be inventive but felt short on the mix. the shishito peppers were just way too hot  out of  were spicy. the parmesan creamy crust was an interesting test but just did not go with the crunchy spiky shishito."
583,Neil S.,1126,5,6/12/18,"wow! just an amazing restaurant. food and service was super. arrived without reservations hoping to squeeze into an opportunity. well this place is popular so be prepared to wait. we sat in lounge area. ordered drinks, ring of fire  was delicious. has a light tang of heat and tasty. then after  minutes the hostess came and offered a table under one condition, we must be done in   because table is committed. of course we can finish! sat by kitchen. actually can watch how efficient team works. very cool. all food is served family style. frankly it is tasting portions so you can try many dishes. our group had food allergies and the server helped that. she took a menu and crossed out all problem dishes. so nice. we ordered halibut, escargot ravioli, kohlrabi salad, pig face and roasted cauliflower . all agreed pig face was the best. the reviews are correct. you will not regret a meal here."
584,Risa S.,1126,5,6/11/18,"fabulous dishes, so different, creative mix of fruit in sauces. really delicious!! had kohlrabi salad, roasted cauliflower amazing , halibut, lamb ribs."
585,Ee Vonn Y.,1126,5,6/3/18,"might be my favorite restaurant in chicago. interior  decorative, classy, and fun. service  good. dishes are timed on point to make sure you enjoy each item sufficiently before the next dish is delivered so you are not swamped with  dishes at the same time all out of order. roasted cauliflower pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint  there is cheese. delicious, salted, savory, soft, and tastes like home. escargot ravioli bacon tamarind sauce, escarole & celery, crispy onions  could not taste the escargot. resembled more like flattened dumplings in some broth. loved it. pan roasted halibut marcona almond butter, white asparagus . blueberry nuoc cham, beech mushroom  fish sauce!! it was truly delicious and honored the vietnamese fish sauce taste without watering it down. must order. crisp braised pork shank buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion & radish kimch, naan  pork falls off the bone. delicious, savory, soft. naan is decent but the pork is so good without it. lemon make you happy lemonÄã pound cake, sorrel ice cream, almond crunch, cheesecake sauce  my husband hates lemon and pound cake but he ate it all. must order. the jam old forester bourbon, strawberry shrub, saison  the perfect refreshing summer strawberry drink."
586,Jordan Z.,1126,5,5/20/18,"girl & the goat is not just hype this culinary experience might be in my top  meals. i am always looking to try something new. i like to challenge my tastebuds and be able to say oh yeah, i ate that. the ambiance of this restaurant was relaxed a little dark for my photo liking, but i loved the subtle goat decor. i ordered the girl & the goat cab franc, which had great, full bodied taste. our server explained that our party of two should order  plates, as everything is meant to share. he told us he planned to bring the dishes out in order of lightest to richest, which i truly appreciated. one of the bartenders we met in the somerset used to work here and mentioned we could ask for half orders of the veggies a big hushed power move, as we got to try more things! we ordered the sauted green beans  and the roasted cauliflower !, the goat carpaccio ., duck tongues ! and the escargot ravioli . i would definitely love to go back and try more of their entrees options."
587,Diana C.,1126,4,5/10/18,"this place is legit! it was pretty busy when we went, but we were able to get a seat by the entrance right away since it was just the two of us. zack was our server. he was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. we ordered the brioche bread that was warm fluffy and came with some delicious whipped salmon cream and some spicy pickled peppers. delicious! i could have eaten two of these on my own. we also ordered the crispy short ribs. it was served with avocado, radishes, red onion, and some tangy dressing. my favorite dish of the night! the goat empanada sounded interested and since we were at the girl and the goat, we figured we had to order at least one goat dish. it came with miso dressing and some pickled mushrooms. it was pretty good, but on the smaller portion size. our veggie dish was the roasted cauliflower . it is served with mint, pine nuts, and pickled peppers same as the ones that came with the brioche bread. this was a pretty solid dish, we ate the whole thing! the last thing we ordered was the bucatini. it was udon style thick flour noodles with milk braised pork. unfortunately this was my least favorite dish. the pork was a little dry and the flavors were a little too much it was like they were competing with each other, not melding together. solid  start meal, service, and ambiance. i would definitely recommend it to people and i would definitely want to come back when i am in town next! yum!"
588,Emily P.,1126,5,4/30/18,"we have been here quite a few times, and i am never disappointed! it is quite difficult to get in, so make reservations far in advance. the plates are made to share, so you can order ~ for  people. however, the vegetable portions are large and also the best part, in my opinion. i highly highly recommend the sauted green beans .. crunchy and coated with a nice vinaigrette and cashews which add a sweet touch. the roasted cauliflower is very good as well. as far as meats go, the pork shank is to die for. the combination of flavors and textures makes it my favorite dish in chicago. additionally, for a nice restaurant, the prices are reasonable."
589,Emily D.,1126,5,4/8/18,"went here with my parents for a special occasion and it was fantastic! we shared a variety of dishes i remember the duck tongue and roasted cauliflower and peppers were a few favorites of min and got some drinks i got one called the ring of fire delicious!. my mom does not eat much meat and was unsure about whether the vegetarian dishes would be as good they sound very simple but i remember us all being so surprised and impressed by how good they all tasted! we booked our reservation months in advance, and it was a pricy night out, but worth every penny. the seating and decor of the restaurant is also unique and conducive to a relaxing yet stimulating night out, and it is open super late, so no worries for late diners who like to take their time!"
590,Natasha R.,1126,3,3/22/18,"i waited a really long time to come here. my friendly finally got a reservation and i really excited to get the chance. now, the food is good but i do not see why it gets so much hype. staff amazing and attentive pace of meal my friends and i ordered a lot of dishes, probably too many for three people, but they simply came out too quickly!!! i felt like every minute we finished one dish the next was at our table and it was totally overwhelming! bread sweet onion brioche if you ever had brioche, this was just brioche, nothing special. vegetable the vegetable dishes are all solid choices. we ate the following shishito peppers really good but i did not see the need for the parmesan, roasted cauliflower yum!, and potatoblue cheese pierogies i would not order these again for the price, nothing special fish the escargot ravioli could have been filled with anything, they did not highlight the flavor of the escargot and everything was drowned out with the taste of bacon. seared diver scallops so good! i love scallops and these were nicely prepared, however, what is with the citrus? the blood orange just did not work with this dish. seared tuna good but small portion and unexciting, i have had seared tuna just as good at a cheaper restaurant. calamari brushetta i was really excited about this dish but the calamari was a little under cooked and had an odd fishy flavor i did not enjoy at all. meat beef short ribs good but why more grapefruit!!!! i do not get it!! nothing special pig face tasted good but nothing spectacular. goat with lobster and crab the goat was really good but the flavors did not work with the lobster and crab. dessert sticku tasty crunchy toffee omg order this!! amazing! best part the staff was really nice and the environment was enjoyable. the meat is all high quality. major complaint what is with the blood orange and grape fruit making an appearance on so many dishes? it just did not work and the pieces were too big and drowned out other flavors. i do not get why this place is so popular. there are many other restaurants that are more interesting with a shorter wait time. i really wanted to love this but will not be coming back anytime soon."
591,Elizabeth L.,1126,5,3/20/18,"handsdown one of my favorite restaurant in chicago. whenever i have friends visiting from out of state, i always recommend this restaurant as well, and they always loved it! i frequent this restaurant often, the only thing i hate is that the wait is always so long. if you are not coming here right when it opens or with a reservation, expect hours of wait. even with a reservation a month in advance, i almost always get the remaining  or pm slots, that is how popular the restaurant is. however, despite how busy it is, i never experience any delay in service. there is a couch area by the bar if you want to wait before your table is ready, which makes the waiting pleasant. the service is prompt and wellpaced either. onto the menu and the food. now, even though i have dined at this restaurant many times, i can always find something new on the menu, as they change often. the food here are small plates and designed to be shared. i definitely recommend the roasted cauliflower , lamb steak, and anything with goat obviously. i have never been disappointed by the food, and the cocktails are amazing too. i have to share the one experience where the service was truly outstanding, that prompted me to write this review. it was one of the rare nights that my friend and i decided to get some drinks at the restaurant spontaneously. my friend knew someone working at the restaurant, and asked the server if the guy he knows is working tonight, and our server told us no. no big deal, we still sat down and ordered our drinks. soon, they served us an appetizer on the house. we were surprised, but happily accepts. after we finished our food and drinks, we were surprised to find out that the bill was . our server did not have to do that for us at all, yet he did it to make our night. we still tipped him the full amount of our meal, but we know that the next time we dine there, he will take good care of us, and we will give generous tips for him "
592,Lan C.,1126,4,3/11/18,"always love the food at gatg. sure the plating mostly looks kind of meh, but the taste is always good. dishes i have tried range from good to outstanding. plus, i love that chef izard posted her recipes online so that i can learn some of her trick, for example the blueberry nuoc cham! as i hardly successfully book though opentable, i always walk in, and my strategy is either come early  or  pm, or very late pm or later, and i never have to wait too long. the reason i am giving gatg  stars is that the desserts were never their strength, plus in my most recent visit,my all time favorite dish roasted cauliflower was very salty, hopefully it was a solely low note!"
593,Pam W.,1126,5,2/28/18,"when you visit a city a lot and ask people for restaurant recommendations and just about everyone says the same one, then you have to go there, right?! girl & the goat is that place. on several trips i tried to make a reservation, but it was always full. i did not try this trip, thinking that it would be impossible to get a last minute reservation. but because i asked some colleagues again for recommendations and girl & the goat was mentioned i decided to give it a try....score! dinner for  @ . we got to the restaurant just in time for our reservation and checked in. the host informed us that it would be a little while because several tables had paid, but they were taking their time. no problem. we decided to sit in the bar area and have a couple of drinks. i ordered the best of threeit was awesome! ketel one vodka, pimms #, cucumber and lime. so refreshing and not too sweet. my dinner companion had a white russian. we sat enjoying our cocktails for a few minutes, taking in the decor and buzz of the placeit was packed! a host came by to update us and said our table would be a couple more minutes because they were cleaning it. after a brief wait, they informed us the table was ready. we closed out our tab and made our way to the dining area. if you want an intimate place, this is not for you. if you do not mind basically sitting with the neighboring table, then you are all set. we luckily were sat by  folks on our left who were nice and chatted with us a bit. on the other side was a couple who were either arguing or just did not feel like talking to each other. you know the couple that sits at dinner not talking to each other...that was them. the waiter stopped by to greet us and apologized for the wait. 'no need to apologize,' we said. 'it was not long.' he explained that everything is served family style and he recommended sharing  things since it was two of us. the menu is pretty diverse and totally interesting. they had a nice selection of vegetables, seafood, chicken, pork, beef and of course, goat. we studied the menu while he was gone and were ready to order when he showed up with complementary bread with smoke salmon mousse and pickled peppers because we had to wait beyond our reservation time. wow! that was impressive that they take service that seriously. we ordered the rest of our meal and he would determine how to bring our and order the courses. we were ready for refills on our cocktails so i got a martini and my dinner partner ordered best of three. we tucked into the bread and dip, and it was super. i have not been eating a lot of bread because i have been watching carbs but it was so worth it. our first course showed up, which was the hamachi crudo. the crudo has a puffed black rice, which gave it a cool crunch. it also had pickled kumquats and a soychili vinaigrette, which added the right amount of kick. it was great. next up was roasted cauliflower and roasted shishito peppers that had parmesan and miso...so yummy! the cauliflower was interesting too with mint and pickled peppers. i was already super full but we had two more things coming, so i had to muscle through. then came the goat empanadas. i have never had goat but felt compelled to try it since this place is known for it. the empanadas seemed like a good entrylevel option. they were so good! the meat filling reminded me of pulled pork. the final thing delivered was the crispy beef short rib. i was so full i could only try one bite. it was also good but my food coma was setting in, so maybe  of my tastebuds we are engaged. #regrettoofull so glad i gave it one last try to get a reservation. this was definitely an experience and the food is something i will not forget."
594,Ben G.,1126,5,10/28/18,"update  back for another visit to the girl and goat, and happy to say this experience was on par with our first. had reservation for pm on a saturday night very busy and was seated by pm. the staff was dressed in harry potter theme for halloween which was funny. we ordered the following on this go around smoked apple pirogies wood fired lamb ribs duck tongues wood oven roasted pig face goat neck chocolate pavlova saysame! dessert sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake dessert all nighter cocktail talkin about chaitown cocktail rory mcilroy cocktail everything was top notch just like our last visit. we purposely tried new things this go around, since each item is always so good. the exception being the roasted pig face... hard to not get that one again. favorites had to be the lamb ribs one of the best things i have had in my life and the goat neck more food than other entrees... this was a special so probably not always available. as usual you get through a couple small plates together and think  man this is good but will it fill me up? then by the end you are totally stuffed. we definitely spent more this time  on just cocktails. the all nighter is good but wow is it strong. probably why they give you half a glass worth lol. we will be back. hard to beat this place."
595,Divalicious K.,1126,3,9/30/18,"get a reservation bc this place is busy, even during the weekday!!!! came from out of town for one night and had to choose carefully what i put in my stomach. glad i chose this place. i ordered the fried duck tongues and the oven roasted pigface. the duck tongues were amazing! i have had nasty duck tongues in the past and was hesitant to order but so glad i did! the texture and flavor was amazing! and the combination together with the tuna poke and fried wontons was heavenly. the pigface was good too. i did not appreciate it as much until i read an article on serious eats website that it was made with the actual face of a pig . if you google pigface serious eats you could see behind the scenes of how it is made. it is pretty graphic and not for the faint of heart!!! next time i visit chicago, i will definitely come back here. one of the few places that has left a memorable impression on my extremely picky taste buds!!"
596,Brad B.,1126,5,9/14/18,"we came here for a nice dinner on our trip to chicago and could not be happier! from a great atmosphere to great food, everything hit the spot. we had to get a reservation for here like  months in advance and even then could only get one for , so definitely plan ahead if you want to check it out. the atmosphere of the restaurant was rustic, with lots of wood and greenery around, as well as a great artwork and goats everywhere. the staff was very friendly and informative and really helped us work our way through the menu. the menu is a bunch of small plates separated by categories like veggies, fish, meat, and bread. we were also given a separate menu for all the goat offerings they had. we chose a few items from each category and were off to the races. the menu is very eclectic and i was intrigued to try things i had never had before like duck tongues .  everything we ordered was flowed out by our server perfectly and it created a great meal from start to finish. the flavors were great and complimented each other well. even jumping around from various styles and preparations, the dishes harmonized well. even after all that we found the room to order some dessert which also hit the spot and was a nice ending to an amazing experience."
597,Jason Y.,1126,5,8/31/18,"the gf and myself ended up at this location as it is one of the hottest restaurants on randolph and seemed to be relatively difficult to book. after arriving on a weekday night, the place was fully packed and difficult to walk inside the restaurant itself. after getting seated, it was nice to see the open kitchen and really seeing the hustle and bustle of the kitchen staff working along with servers. the bar is nearby and people were drinking and talking loudly over the music and overall the restaurant just seemed extremely lively. the lighting was dim and the bathroom may be a bit of an adventure it is located downstairs and no shared bathrooms, only private bathrooms in a long hallway but it was great to see the effort invested into building such a cool restaurant. supposedly the restaurant menu does change according to season and we ended up ordering the duck tongues , bucatini, and wood oven roasted pig face. the pig face was amazing and had crazy taste profiles and perfectly fried potato stix strings that gave each bite a nice crunch. the bucatini was heavy but tasty and tasted even better with sprinkled red pepper flakes on top. the duck tongue was easily the highlight of the meal because we were surprised by the ahi tuna on the bottom of the tongues . the crispiness of the duck tongues worked well with the freshness of fish and the wonton strips gave everything a bit more texture. it is easy to tell that this place goes over the top with taste profiles and experimenting with new combinations. i would highly recommend for anyone to experience the ambiance and food at this restaurant if they were ever to visit chicago!"
598,Alexander S.,1126,5,8/29/18,"amazing meal! this restaurant lives up to all the hype and reviews. from beginning of the meal to the end the food, ambience and service were excellent. from the unctuous and umami of the duck tongues and delicious take on crab rangoon, everything was delicious. next time i am in town i hope to come back."
599,Christopher M.,1126,5,8/26/18,"tremendous. simply tremendous. and, more than almost anywhere i have ever dined, they all make it seem so light and effortless. drinks come and food arrives with a sense of unforced happiness that is hard to really describe. and the food is absolutely incredible  the roasted pig face is even better than advertised, the duck tongues are unbelievable. the escargot ravioli is the one dish that was very good, but easily the slightest of the three i ordered. i am so excited they are opening a location out here in los angeles. this is food that begs to be available at more than just one location."
600,Margo F.,1126,4,8/18/18,"good, creative drinks. solid vegetarian dishes favorites include roasted cauliflower, woodgrilledÄã broccoli, bread options. good meat dishes include braised beef tongue , duck tongues , and wood oven roasted pig face  this last item not being for those easily turned off by strange textures."
601,Nicole B.,1126,4,8/9/18,"when i decided to visit chicago, i booked flights and hotel first and girl & the goat second. our experience was really good service was stellar and the food was pretty unique. we paid around  for two people, including  dishes, tea, and tip. they call their plates familystyle, but that suggests large portions to me, so i would say they are more tapas style  small, shareable plates more for tasting and less for getting a food coma unless you have deep pockets. that being said, you can get full if you choose wisely  we ordered the blueberry sourdough bread which was super filling, the duck tongues nicely crispy and chewy, the pig face every bite was butter, and the goat empanadas all of which were tasty. desserts are a little limited, so we opted for tea instead they serve a brand called rare cellar. the tea was not as great as the food, but you do get a big cup. overall, i recommend the place if you can snag a reservation!"
602,Jason L.,1126,5,7/31/18,"wow! now i understand why i had to get a reservation three months in advance! the girl & the goat is just like bestia in los angeles in terms of hype and having to book a reservation months in advance. it is funny how the girl & the goat is also going to open a location in la near bestia in the arts district in dtla. the ambiance and service here are topnotch. the restaurant has a modern, rustic vibe and it is cool how you can see into the kitchen. there are goat paintingsphotossculptures everywhere which is pretty cool to see. our waitress was super cool and was more than happy to educate us on the menu and her personal favorites. you can tell she is really enthusiastic about working here. since this place is meant for sharing, we ordered  dishes duck tongues , goat empanadas, wood fired lamb ribs and the pan roasted halibut. all of them were great! i honestly cannot think of a negative to say about any of the dishes. the duck tongues were fantastic. combined with tuna poke, the dish has a nice balance between the fish and the duck tongue . the crispy wontons give the plate a nice crunch and texture. i do not think i have ever had an empanada that good. the skin was so crispy! the lamb ribs fell right off the bone and the blueberrytamarind glaze just melted in my mouth. i wish there were more ribs in one order! the halibut was tasty as well. the blueberry nuoc cham was the perfect mix of sweet, sour and salty. somehow, we still had room for dessert and got the chocolate pavlova and caramel corn & malt balls. the pavlova was exceptional. paired with black sesame ice cream, it was delicious! i am not a huge fan of chocolate but this dessert might have converted me. it is neat to see top chef stephanie izard working and handling orders for the kitchen. it is not every day that you can dine at a top chef's restaurant and see them in action. i cannot wait for the la location to open!"
603,Christa C.,1126,4,7/8/18,"i had an incredible dinner at girl & the goat! i booked my reservation about two months in advance, and the only opening available the entire weekend was at p on a saturday. basically, book your reservation well in advance. if you like popcorn chicken, you must get the duck tongues ! the perfect crispiness on the outside and the soft, tender inside is definitely reminiscent of the perfect popcorn chicken. i loved the duck tongues , but my favorite dish was the duck tartare. very tender meat and had many diverse textures on the plate, and i loved the duck crackling on it! going into my meal, i was the most excited for the goat belly confit, but it ended up being my least favorite meal of the evening the goat belly confit was a bit too indulgent and sat heavy with me. moreover, it was the most onedimensional dish as many of the flavorstextures were lost in its buttery sauce. however, if buttery textures are what you are seeking, then i think you would love this dish! i had a delicious cup of tea after my dinner, and incrediblewellpaced service throughout my meal. it is definitely worth the investment to make a reservation and enjoy the incredible flavors and textures offered at girl & the goat."
604,Emily D.,1126,5,7/2/18,"i ate at g&tg while in chicago on vacation, and it did not disappoint. every dish was interesting and inventive especially the combos of goat and seafood, but a few stole the show for my husband and i. the goat liver mousse was rich and delicious, and the duck tongues were incredible. we also enjoyed the pig face which was like an upscale breakfast dish, and the goat belly confit. our server was attentive and helpful with dish and drink recommendations, and made it a great experience. the atmosphere is fun and noisy, and it was clear that everyone in the dining room was enjoying themselves. we will definitely return on our next trip to chicago, and will be hoping that the duck tongues are on the menu again."
605,Erica P.,1126,5,7/1/18,"fantastic food and service. this is now one of my favorite restaurants in chicago. we had  dishes between two of us. everything was presented well, and tasted great. the soft she will crab cakes were not a traditional crab cake, but they tasted amazing. the fried duck tongues were a surprisingly delectable treat. the whole experience was made by how knowledgeable our waiter was. once we chose our dishes he was in charge of putting them in order and pacing them to come out at the right time. the extra effort was noticeable, and it truly made the experience exceptional."
606,Mike C.,1126,5,7/1/18,"my favorite restaurant in chicago. you pick several dishes to share and they order it from light to rich. there are some interesting dishes such as duck tongues , goat empanadas, and others. additionally, some good vegetarian dishes including beets. solid cocktail list."
607,Leticia L.,1126,5,6/28/18,"we are about half way through the year and this had to easily be the best meal i have had in . everything was delicious, thoughtful, and unique. this was our last night in chicago and i was lucky enough to score a last minute table for pm. we enjoyed  dishes oysters dessert for two very hungry people. let me tell you.... every piecesauce garnish was devoured. we enjoyed  duck tongues  roasted beet salad  oven roasted pig face  rock shrimp  confit goat belly  wood fire oysters  chocolate pavlova  i cannot wait to come back and try the rest of the menu during another visit to chicago. cheers to the chefs, waiters, and all at the girl & the goat! thank you for the truly wonderful experience."
608,Nancy P.,1126,5,6/27/18,"this place was amazing! the space is very chic and trendy but yet casual and comfortable. wait staff was knowledgeable about the food and made some wonderful recommendations. we had the sweet onion brioche, blueberry sourdough, warm marinated olives, sauted green beans, roasted beats, duck tongues , wood fire lamb ribs, crisp braised pork shank. everything was delicious but my favorite dishes were the duck tongues and green beans. the duck tongues were nice and crispy but soft in the inside, went well with the freshness of the poke. the green beans were super tasty, fresh, cooked to perfection, nice acid from the vinaigrette, they were like nothing i had ever had before. it is a must eat place while in chicago!"
609,Bethany B.,1126,5,6/19/18,"seriously one of the top meals i have had! not only was the food fantastic and uber creative the atmosphere and hip hop music made it an unforgettable meal. we started off with goat liver mousse that came with piping hot crumpets to die for..i may have tried to lick the bowl clean then went on to the roasted beet salad, followed by duck tongues with poke a must tryit changed my life and last but not least confit goat belly with lobster, crab & bourbon butter. my only complaint was my stomach was not big enough to try everything on the menu."
610,Priscilla T.,1126,4,9/5/18,small plates style so i recommend coming with more people so you can try more things! highly recommend making a reservation like at least  weeks ahead. it gets very busy here even tho it is a pretty big place. service was excellent. our server was really helpful and attentive. started off with roasted cauliflower and soft she will crab cake. these were my favorite dishes. the soft she will crab cake is not a crab cake at all. it is soft she will crab on top of this imitation crab cake. the blackberries were a nice touch. the braised beef tongue was interesting... it was kinda too salty and a lot of weird textures that were more rough and chewy. the wood oven roasted pig face was pretty good. the fatty parts were delicious. just melts right in your mouth.
611,Kim C.,1126,5,7/1/18,"i am usually quite skeptical of restaurants that have a lot of hype. when i learned that my husband made reservations at girl & the goat three months in advance for our anniversary, i was not completely sold. but the day finally rolled around, so it was time to see what the hype was all about. the restaurant is on the smaller side, with fairly dark styling and an open kitchen in the back. between all of the conversation and the music, it is quite loud, but i did not feel that it distracted from the experience. in fact, it lends itself well to the casual tapasstyle dining. we waited  minutes for our reserved table, which was not too bad for a bustling saturday night at peak dinner hour. our server was prompt and fairy attentive. she recommended  plates, so that is what we did. we had the olive focaccia bread as a starter. i am not a big bread person, but i thought it was pretty good albeit a little on the dry side. it had a strong olive flavor. for the other plates, we did the hamachi crudo, panfried shishito peppers, braised beef tongue , and goat empanadas. everything was very good. i liked the empanadas the best, with the shishito peppers a close second. for the price, the hamachi seemed a little on the skimpy side, but it was delicious... i do not think i would order it again, though. i felt myself getting full halfway through the goat empanadas our last plate, so the server was spoton with her ordering quantity suggestion. all in all, i would say that girl & the goat came pretty close to living up to the hype. i really enjoyed the experience, and there is no denying that stephanie izard is a talented chef. each dish was carefully thought out and executed well. i would not walk in without a reservation and wait  hours for a table... but for a special occasion, this was worth the effort and price. one more note i am probably the only person that noticed this, but i could not help but take note of the music being played  late 's through mid's alternative. my inner teenage self was going nuts that beck's devil's haircut was playing in a nice restaurant! if you are a genxer, you will enjoy the soundtrack."
612,Brenda M.,1126,5,6/23/18,"this place is definitely worth the wait! anytime friends come into the city or anyone ask for a restaurant recommendation this is the place i mention. every dish is crafted perfectly. i recently had the roasted beets, grilled pork belly, braised beef tongue , and olive yuzu focaccia.  recommend"
613,joe R.,1126,5,6/4/18,"i did my research and damn i am glad i did. this place is the business. raw oysters  super tasty  a little on the small side. would not order it again but i was not necessarily disappointed with it. just wish there was more goodness to eat. braised beef tongue  very flavorful. it had this asian fusion but a little more americanized. the braised beef was tender and did not overpower anything but actually paired well with the rest of the meal and was very light. sauted green beans  so much full flavor. very light and i did not feel gross. the green beans were crunchy but cooked through. it was actually very delicious. i feel like it is hard to get the flavor and cook it to perfection and they hit the bullseye. pig face  i will move to chicago to have this meal. crispy, bursting with freaking flavor, it was like pork belly that was not super chewy. it just worked with the egg in so many ways. this place definitely lived up to its expectations and when i do come back to chicago, i will be visiting this place again. oh and my girlfriend destroyed the lemon cake. just fyi guys  if you want your girl to do things later on lol give her desserts. jk but honestly it made her happy and that is what is important. good food, good company=happiness!"
614,Tazeen L.,1126,4,5/24/18,"returned after a long hiatus thanks to a friend passing through town who was hellbent on visiting izard's origin story... snagged a table for two and proceeded to order too many dishes according to our waiter who normally would be correct but just did not know who he was talking to.... so here's the damage goat empanadas  awesome meat was tender and not gamey, crust was crispy, topped with creamy goodness...get them braised beef tongue  ok chips were a little oily, but good acidity from the salsa verde to cut the richness of the meat, just not my cup of tea though cauliflower  yum  and i do not even like cauliflower... well seasoned with peppers that added a little kick calamari bruschetta disappointed this is the one that kept getting rave reviews but i found it oily, salty and a little fishy... actually liked most of the components except for the actual calamari halibut  ok  a little bland and fish was slightly over cooked, mushrooms were yummy though green beans  winner  the veggies were killing it creamy, crisp, well seasoned confit goat belly  pure indulgence so rich and decadent between the butter sauce, lobster and confit goat  delish but a few bites is all it takes service was great and the waiter was so impressed or scared by how much we were able to consume that he brought by a complimentary dessert even after we turned down ordering one i am betting that he just wanted to see if we could actually eat more  challenge accepted. lemon pound cake with sorrel ice cream was a nice end to the meal a few misses for me but overall a great meal that also checked a box for my traveling foodie friend"
615,Iris C.,1126,5,5/16/18,"i had the pleasure of dinning at girl and the goat for my boyfriend's birthday. we were lucky enough to sit at the chef's table and let me tell you, what a fantastic dining experience this was. not only were we able to eat the delicious food, we also were able to see it being made. and as if working in a busy kitchen was not enough, the chefs still made a point to interact with us and answer any questions we had. if you ever have the opportunity to seat at the chef's table, you should do it! here is what we had sorry for the long list, we a lot j   pan fried shishito pepper although i am not a fan of shishito pepper, i have to say that these had great flavors and the dish was pretty big, definitely a plate to share, in my opinion.   wood grilled broccoli my favorite dish! the broccoli was made to perfection and even had spiced rice crispies. at first when i read that on the menu was not really feeling it but when i tasted it, it was sooo good!   green garlic pierogies my second favorite dish! the smoked tomatorhubarb relish made the dish for me, as i am used to regular pierogies and this was a nice turn on this dish   escargot ravioli although i am french, i do not mess with escargots....at all, however, i wish i did because this dish smelled so good. my boyfriend totally loved them. if i did not know that there were escargots in them, i probably would have eaten them...i did sneak away a little crispy onion!!  braised beef tongue yea, totally did not even look at that one... but, per my boyfriend, it was cooked to perfection and the salsa verde was a great pairing   sweet onion brioche this was my least favorite dish, in all honesty. it was good but nothing breathtaking. i thought the smoke salmon cream cheese lacked the smoke salmon flavor and the brioche bread was a bit dry, to my taste   lemon make you happy dessert this was delicious! i absolutely love lemon pound cake and this was a hit! the almond crunch that came with it create the perfect flavor mixture and the cheesecake sauce was yummy too. the sorrel ice cream was okay to me. i would probably need to try it again as this was a flavor i was not expecting   chocolate pavlova saysame i was not into this dessert at all because i do not like chocolate nor sesame mixed with sweets. my boyfriend thought it was delicious and was a big fan of the sesame whip and black sesame brittle, in particular in conclusion, we were really happy with our meal and our server so sorry for not remembering her name was a delight. she made sure to check on us semiregularly and provided great information on the food, as well. icing on the cake, cassie, the sommelier, provided excellent wine recommendations for which my boyfriend was over the moon. she was so nice and she also checked on us, here and there, throughout our meal. definitely will be back and thank you for your kindness, delicious food and atmosphere!"
616,Maling H.,1126,4,4/30/18,"this was one of the top restaurants on my list to try in chicago. we had made reservations  months in advance. the earliest time we could get on a monday night was pm. so book early if you guys plan to try this restaurant. we started out with goat liver mousse. i was hesitate at first to try it thinking it might be gamey but my bf convinced me it was good. turned out he was right. everything went well together. next we had braised beef tongue . nothing special. i would not order this again. crispy beef short ribs and goat empanadas were good. my favorite dish was probably the wood oven roasted pig face. that was delicious. for dessert, we had the caramel corn & malt balls. it was pretty good. service was on point. overall the restaurant was good but not as good as i thought it would be with all the reviews they have on yelp. maybe i came in with too high of an expectation. would i come back? i probably would if it was a special occasion."
617,Rosy L.,1126,5,4/22/18,"hands down my favorite restaurant in chicago and maybe even in the country. the menu changes from time to time but i have been there  times already and have not been disappointed yet last two times the menus were the same. you really cannot go wrong with anything you order here. we made reservations every time and all were made well in advance so we were able to get a time that we liked, rather than waiting a ridiculous amount of time in line or eating at an odd time. you really have to make a reservation  days in advance! most recently, we ordered the roasted cauliflower, seared diver scallops, braised beef tongue , wood oven roasted pig face, calamari bruschetta, duck tongue , chickpea fritter, olive yuzu focaccia, and and goat empanada. the beef tongue , pig face and scallops were my favorite this time around! all three of these were super tender and cooked perfectly. was not really a big fan of the chickpea fritter unfortunately it was plated beautifully but the texture on the inside of the fritter was a little odd for my liking and the fritter itself was a little bland. i like the ambience to this place, it is pretty hip and really good vibes, but is not good for kids as it may be a little loud and the menu is not very kid friendly."
618,Ujjwal K.,1126,5,4/13/18,"great restaurant! great food. a little noisy though, need to make a reservation if you are going in a group on weekday and definitely on weekend! their chickpea fritters, braised beef tongue , brioche bread was amazing! our group tried a variety of drinks, which were all very good!"
619,Victoria Q.,1126,5,4/2/18,"this restaurant was on my top go to bucket list, while traveling to chicago. the food, ambiance, and service is spectacular. our server jerson, was very knowledgeable and attentive. he informed us on how to order, the dishes are like tapas, small and good to share. between the two, we ordered four plates to share. the hamachi crudo, seared diver scallops, braised beef tongue and confit goat belly. everything was delicious, my top two favorites, the scallops and goat belly. when i come back to visit, this restaurant will be my first stop. love it! fyi, try to make reservations as soon as possible & if there is room for dessert, order the caramel corn & malt balls!"
620,Danesh I.,1126,5,3/6/18,"a memorable and delicious meal through and through. welcoming and warm, the space, the staff, and atmosphere make for a classy but not pretentious experience. take your pick and enjoy pretty much any and everything on the menu because all the dishes seem to be made to please. goat is far too uncommon and underappreciated in contemporary american cuisine, but i was glad to enjoy such delicious options such as the carpaccio with smoked trout roe and olivemaple vinaigrette, goat ribs, and the confit goat belly. i also managed to try the crispy beef short ribs, braised beef tongue , and wood oven roasted pig face...all of which were superb. the pig face was best dish of the six my friend and i sampled tender and flavorful meat melded perfectly with the sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, and red winemaple makes for a delectable dish that delivers on all fronts. a wonderful time through and through, and an absolute star in a city full of great options."
621,Francesca T.,1126,5,11/9/17,"i went here on a monday night and this place was packed. my parents and i wanted wine and tapas style food. this is the place to go! be warned this is not a traditional tapas place, they serve unique types of tapas. i loved the different types of food they offered. we got the escargot ravioli, braised beef tongue my fave, wood oven roasted pig face, pork shank, raw kusshi, fried old , and confit goat belly nd best. oh and  bottles of wine. i can definitely see myself coming again for some drinks and tapas."
622,Christina Y.,1126,5,9/27/17,"honestly my favorite restaurant in chicago! since we could not get a reservation, we decided to head to the restaurant early. we arrived around  pm and were able to find seating at the bar. we ordered goat carpaccio, calamari bruschetta, and the braised beef tongue . all of them were unique and amazing dishes. i liked the braised beef tongue the best  it was tender and well flavored. the goat carpaccio paired with trout roe was a surprising combination but worked magic. the bruschetta was on the heavier side, but the calamari was sauted and tender. the ambiance of the place is loud and lively with trendy decoration. it was absolutely packed by  pm so i would recommend going early if you do not have a reservation. the service is great as well they just kept on refilling my water. i think this restaurant is a mustgo if you ever visit chicago!"
623,Jamie Y.,1126,4,9/27/17,decided to stop by here for a super early dinner on saturday right after they opened. it was a good idea to come early since we were able to grab seats at the bar non bar seatings are reservation only!. the place was also packed when we were leaving. the service here was amazing throughout the meal. the interior of the place was super classy and bright.  goat carpaccio super well made dish. i love how there were salmon roe on top of the carpaccio that gave it a nice savory touch with the fish oil. great appetizer to start.  braised beef tongue  extremely tender meat and i only wish there was more! the flavor also the salsa verde went really well with the greens and meat.  calamari bruschetta the grilled calamari was so fresh and delicious. the bruschetta was a bit too heavy for my taste and one of the bread was kind of stale. overall a great meal. apparently you can do half orders for some dishes? but i would definitely double check.
624,Michelle T.,1126,5,10/25/18,"food ordered that we really enjoyed  branzino se asian flavors.  broccoli enjoyed the smokey flavors  cauliflower pickled, so do not order if you do not like sour flavors  octopus more unique stuff we enjoyed as well  chickpea  duck tongue we enjoyed it, but note that its on the fatty side  pig face kind of similar to asian cuisine but not exactly alike so its worth ordering  dessert aw, honey honey the goat capriccio itself did not have much flavor, could have skipped it. the hamachi crudo was not bad, but not a stand out. i have not been to many restaurants where almost all the dishes were amazing. it was our favorite meal in chicago. i cannot wait for them to open their second store in la next year!"
625,H Y.,1126,3,10/1/18,"first time in chicago of course i am going to try girl and the goat. unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. let us start with the food and drinks. i had the hamachi crudo , grilled short ribs and green beans. hamachi was excellent. delicious and refreshing. the grilled short ribs came out a bit lukewarm and quickly cooled due to the cut of the beef. perhaps they should consider serving this on a cast iron plate to retain the heat. or have the servers step up their game. i was disappointed that there was not more complexity and heat from the sichan flavors. green beans were hot and tasty. nice use of fish sauce. aperol spritz was excellent. service was a mixed bag. great while you had there attention. glad i got to try it but there is better food and service in your fine town."
626,Lisa W.,1126,5,9/6/18,"i cannot believe how great the culinary scene is in chicago! there is nothing like or similar to girl & the goat in san diego. not even close... we read and everybody recommended this is the place to try...but either come when they open or come late night, like an hour before closing or be prepared for a long wait. we tried to make resos  month in advance...and nothing was available. there was no way we were going to make it at pm and have a dinner...we are not seniors!...so we came late night instead on a sunday and boy, it was still busy!! there were some seatings available thank god. we ordered some cocktails,  dishes to share and half a dessert. we started off with hamachi crudo , skuna bay salmon, pig face, and the bucatini. my favorite dish was the pig face...and that is a must! it oddly tasted like a childhood vietnamese dish but americanized, so good! everything was delicious. the salmon dish was like a salmon poke bowl, plenty of salmon, bucatini filling and savory. the only thing i would change is the hamachi crudo  i did not like the puffed black rice on it...it looked like maggots... so it turned me off. we were suckered into dessert and glad that we got it caramel corn and malt balls, you can get a half order! it was sweet, salty, savory, and was a great ending to all the rich flavorful food. i really wish i lived in the area because i would so come back and try everything else!"
627,Leslie S.,1126,4,8/10/18,"pros beautiful decor, stunning bar, excellent service. i had the hamachi crudo and the beet side salad, with gin libations. i was making a quick snack stop before heading out with friends. everything was delicious, service was quick. i was in and out in  minutes. cons this place was so hyped up that i was expecting more of a wow factor, which is why it is not receiving  stars, everything was delicious but i am not day dreaming of my next visit. very pricey for the serving sizes."
628,Michelle U.,1126,5,8/1/18,"girl & the goat was recommended by every person i know that has visited chicago and listed as one of the top restaurants on every travel guide i have looked at online! my thoughts totally lived up to the hype! make a reservation in advance on open table. was told by the hostess that wait times can be up to  hours without a reservation! ambiance and service here was amazing. modern, but cozy vibes inside. perfect date night spot! i love that you can see into the kitchen. interesting paintings of goats all over the walls. food dishes are tapas style meant for sharing. our server recommended  dishes per person. things i tried hamachi crudo , pan roasted halibut, bucatini, and goat belly. i highly recommend you try all of these items! amazing flavors in each dish. if you still have room for dessert, the chocolate pavlova saysame is great. not too sweet, but hits the spot. i am typically not into splurging at american restaurants with small portions, but girl & the goat was worth it! may be one of the best restaurants i have been to yet. flavors were absolutely amazing, and service was top notch!"
629,Spencer W.,1126,5,7/18/18,"with the amount of reviews this restaurant has i was really hoping it would live up to the hype which it did. most of the dishes here were excellent, if i had to put the them in order of my favorite to least it would go something like this. . lamb ribs . soft she will crab . kohlrabi salad . wood oven roasted pig face its like a breakfast plate . chocolate pavlova . ratatouille focaccia . pork belly . sweet onion brioche . roasted beets . hamachi crudo . roasted cauliflower the service here is pretty good, some of my party would disagree, but the server seemed fine to me. if you would like to try a refreshing cocktail try the puttin' on the spritz, it is fruity and tangy.  one item that looked awesome that we did not order was the pork shank, we saw many of those come off the kitchen line.  we came here with a big group so we all got to try a bunch of things  people which i would also recommend doing. if you are coming from out of town then i would suggest making reservations far in advance. for our party of  we had to make reso is  months in advance and we could only get pm on a friday."
630,Brian B.,1126,5,7/6/18,"hands down our best dining experience in chicago!!!    this place has really transformed our dining experiences, my girlfriend and i fell in love with this place. a few friends of mine in the restaurant industry highly recommended this place to us, as did all the online hype regarding this establishment. girl & the goat lived up to the recommendations and surpassed them by a lot!!!! i called and tried to make a reservation a few days prior to coming into chicago from san diego, we were not sure on our schedule and how we could make this dining experience work. once i called, the prime time dinner hours were booked on the day we wanted, i am not surprised at all after our dining experience. so, we just chose to show up right when they open at pm. we were seated almost immediately and the hostess and manager were extremely kind and very welcoming upon our entry. once we were seated, almost immediately a busser came by with water for us, like ninja quick. extremely attentive young man, he was hustlin' and bustlin' around the restaurant, kudos to him, very hard efficient worker. our server, trevor, greeted us in a very welcoming manner and really took us along for the ride with our dining experience. i ordered a glass of roccascossa red wine, it was very delightful and the staff favorite. i had a martini at another bar right before, while we were waiting for this place to open, so i was trying to behave myself because i was on a date with my lady. i really wanted to try a few other cocktails but we had things to do after our meal. trevor took us through the menu and gave us recommendations and assisted in suggestions and possibilities for my girlfriend's dairy allergy. he was extremely helpful. this place has small plates that are meant to share with one another, such an awesome concept. we started with the sourdough blueberry bread with a homemade berry lamb jam and spring onion cream cheese. she loves bread and we loved this bread, in fact she is going to try and make it at home, good luck babe. the berry lamb jam was like nothing i have ever had before, i wish they sold jars of it. i would wash my face with this stuff in the morning, lol. hamachi crudo , chilisoy vinaigrette, finger hots, pickled kumquats and puffed black rice melted in your mouth like butter, so damn good!! next, we ordered the green beans cooked in a fish sauce vinaigrette with cashews. oh my goodness these were aaaaaaammazing!! cooked to perfection and tasted like no other green beans i have had before. best part is, i got to eat most of these because she is not the biggest fan of green beans, thanks honey! pan roasted halibut with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham and beech mushroom. my mouth is literally still watering from this dish two weeks later, i was so happy i ordered this. it was on my radar before arriving to the restaurant after looking at the menu online. i want another one!! because this dish was made with butter and my girlfriend could not share, our server trevor dropped off a small portion of the kohlrabi salad for her to enjoy. it was made with fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, roasted shiitake and blueberries. it was such a nice gesture and she really loved the salad while i indulged on my halibut. she let me try her salad, it was very very good. finally, we ordered the crisp braised pork shank, with buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion & radish kimchi with naan. this was so damn good because of the crispiness on the outside was perfection, very very impressed. the naan bread was so fluffy and delicious we almost ordered another piece. best naan we have ever ate, hands down! as we were approaching the possibility of dessert, we realized we had to get going to get on our architectural boat tour of the city that was boarding in  minutes. we asked for the check because we did not have much time, and right before the check arrived, trevor came by to drop off a side of the blackberry sorbet i think because my girlfriend was intrigued by this item. he really made our dining experience extremely memorable and created this amazing experience for the two of us. i have been in the industry since  and it is really hard to find great people like him, thank you very much sir we greatly appreciate your wholehearted customer service! overall an absolute must try if you are in the city of chicago!!! the food was absolutely delicious, flavorful and creative. everything was cooked to perfection, the ambiance was very warming and soothing. the staff was incredible, you can tell how well the staff works together and it really sets the tone for the restaurant. kudos to the owner and management for this well oiled machine, you guys are a blessing to society. once again, thank you trevor for one of our best dining experiences this year, you are a rock star dude. if you ever come to san diego, let me know i will take care of you and return the favor. cheers!!"
631,Cori W.,1126,5,6/21/18,"incredible experience! came at pm on a thursday and grabbed a seat at the bar. vinny from walnut creek was a fantastic bartender and made the experience amazing. everything we ordered  pig face, lamb, hamachi crudo , green beans, and duck tongue were absolutely amazing. would absolutely recommend the lamb, it cannot be missed! had such a fun night and would highly recommend girl and the goat to everyone!"
632,Ashley C.,1126,5,6/17/18,"i have heard so many great things about this place so i knew that i needed to fit it into our  day trip somehow. reservations were already booked up once i tried looking a couple weeks ahead of time, but i read a lot of tips saying there was little to no wait for walkins. we arrived  minutes before opening on a friday night just in case, and it paid off! the bar seating is first come first serve for those who do not have reservations. we sat front and center at the bar so service was really fast, we were done in an hour! the menu consists of shared plates and you order everything in the beginning and then they will bring them out to you one by one, which i thought was a great system so you could focus on each dish by itself. we started with the hamachi crudo , light and refreshing and perfect for the hot sunny afternoon. next was the goat empanadas, because why would you come here and not order goat?! i could tell the difference in taste from your typical beef or chicken, but it was not bad in any way, just unique. the blueberry salsa was probably my favorite part. then we had the escargot ravioli. i would have never ordered this on my own but i am glad that my boyfriend did! it is served in this bacon tamarind broth but it really reminded me of minestrone from its smell and color. i think the crispy onions were the perfect touch. last but certainly the best item of the night, wood oven roasted pig face! it comes topped with a beautifully cooked egg and it was so tender you did not even need a knife. the pork just melts in your mouth! i definitely recommend this dish to anyone who comes here! the prices are steep but i can see why it is worth the money and the wait. the flavor combinations are so unique but they all worked so well together. this restaurant deserves more than  stars!"
633,Alex N.,1126,3,5/25/18,"i wish i could understand the hype maybe i just ordered the wrong things considering i am a pescatarian.  minutes after opening the restaurant was slammed on a sunday night. i was lucky enough to snag a seat at the high top communal table that has a full menu with full service. i had the hamachi crudo , the salmon tartar, and the crab cake while the flavors of the three dishes was not bad, it did not leave a lasting impression. my man friend said it was one of the best meals of my life. i really do not see how. another foodie friend of mine agreed the place was a little lackluster. the salmon tartar with strawberries & avocado was the better of the three dishes, and the only thing i would be able to wholeheartedly recommend. being from vegas, i do not care about price whatsoever. bring it all out, and do not even look at the price. in this situation i really did feel taken advantage of when i was being charged  for the hamachi and only  small strips about a bite and a half of fish on the plate. i almost thought about coming back to give it a second chance before the trip was over just to try the other items on the menu, but with so many other amazing choices in chicago, i had to pass."
634,Roneida G.,1126,5,5/10/18,"delightful dining experience from start to finish. our server cesar was amazing helping us navigate the menu, offering suggestions and providing detailed descriptions of each dish. our favorites were kohlrabi salad, green garlic pierogi, hamachi crudo & the pig face. the lemon make you happy dessert was to die for. literally."
635,Melissa W.,1126,5,3/20/18,"i have long awaited to try one of stephanie izard's restaurants after watching her kill it on all the best cooking shows and wow this was amazing! even on a tuesday night, the was place was packed with a very long wait so we had to stake out the bar. these were highly coveted seats and it still took over an hour to snag spots. for  of us we had olive yuzu focaccia pan fried shishito peppers roasted cauliflower hamachi crudo panroasted bass crispy beef short ribs wood oven roasted pig face everything was soooo good!!!! melt in your mouth good! the bread, baked fresh daily across the street at little goat bakery, is a great way to start the meal. personal favorites amongst the dishes were crudo and bass. the only dish i would not order again is the cauliflower  it was not bad, but not as exciting as the rest. of course we had to have dessert. we ordered the caramel corn & malt balls, and they treated us with a chocolate pavlova saysame on the house! we could not have been happier with the desserts. both were outstanding and we happily left with full bellies! totally worth the wait and cost"
636,TD T.,1126,4,2/24/18,"finally got around to trying this place and it lives up pretty well to the hype. service was knowledgeable and ambiance is more on the casual side with a high noise level. started with the pyramid scheme cocktail which was delicious  recommend if you like smoky glenmorangie. hamachi crudo  pretty small portion, but it was really fresh and citrusy. goat liver mousse  loved this spread and thought everything tasted great together. generous portion where you did not have to think about rationing the mousse  very important. escargot ravioli  the pasta and the crispy onions were delicious, but the broth was on the salty side. would be interested coming back and trying more plates!"
637,Alisha W.,1126,5,6/18/18,"we had a fantastic meal. from our server, kristen, to our very last bite  it was perfection. it might be easier to list what we did not try! but this is what we tasted sauted green beans do not be fooled these were the bomb, roasted beets, wood grilled broccoli omg, green garlic pierogies omg, sockeye salmon, grilled pork belly, fried oysters, goat empanadas, ramp marinated grilled chicken, crisp braised pork shank, lemon make you happy and oh yes it did, rhubarb shortcake, and caramel corn and malt balls magic she will people!!!. just outstanding!!!!"
638,Claire B.,1126,5,3/16/18,"been wanting to come here for a while and finally did tonight. reservations were for pm, which may seem too early, but on a friday after the work week, it could not have come sooner. despite the early time, the place was still busy. they recommend two dishes per person. portions are meant for sharing. for starters, we had the sourdough. the red onion mostarda was my favorite spread that came with it. we ordered the potatoblue cheese pierogies, wood grilled broccoli , seared diver scallops, and the crispy beef short ribs. all were delicious. he had the th street's the fox & the goat beer and i had the dark matter dripcoffee. for dessert, we had the chocolate pavlova saysame! it was like a piece of heaven. cannot say enough good things about the food and service. i cannot wait to come back and try the other dishes."
639,Lorilin M.,1126,5,2/11/18,"my friends and i came here for dinner last week, and most everything was delicious. our server told us to order two dishes for each person. everything is served family style, and they stagger when the dishes are brought out. we never had more than two dishes on our table at a time. we ordered a bunch  steamed bar harbor mussels one of my favorites, and possibly the fattest mussels i have ever eaten  seared diver scallops my other favorite...so good  duck tongues my other, other favorite...surprisingly great  potatogoat sausage pizza really tasty  wood  grilled broccoli too rich with the bleu cheese  potatoblue cheese pierogies again, too rich for me, but these were one of my friend's favorites  escargot ravioli solid the restaurant has a homey but cool atmosphere to it. service was great. they accidentally brought us the wrong food twice, but then just let us have one of the plates for free, which i thought was nice. my only minor complaint is that the bathrooms are down two flights of stairs in the dungeon. full belly  wine  heels  stairs = nah. otherwise, though, i loved this place and will definitely be back."
640,Lindsay G.,1126,5,1/14/18,"every bit as delicious and exciting as i had hoped! i am a huge fan of top chef and make it a point to visit alumni restaurants in chicago. my friend surprised me with a trip to girl and the goat and i was so happy! we tried the wood grilled broccoli , steamed mussels, goat empanadas, ham frites, pig face and the bucatini, and loved every bite. the cocktails are amazing, too! we will absolutely be back."
641,Sarah W.,1126,5,10/23/17,"wow! what a dream of a dining experience! i was recently in chicago for an annual meet up with a childhood girlfriend and we were really excited to try this restaurant. luckily, about a month out from our arrival, i was able to secure a  pm reservation for our first night in town. it was all that was available but it ended up working out well as a wonderful start to the trip. as we are both vegetarians, we decided to share a few veggie dishes. everything sounded so wonderful that we did have a hard time picking just a few. warm marinated olives  a wonderful mix of many varieties of thick, meaty olives with sliced garlic and mustard seeds. just the right starter. chickpea fritters  what a little bit of heaven! i am not exaggerating when i say that i will think of this dish often for the rest of my life. it was perfectly balanced with the whipped feta, crunchy chickpeas, nectarine slices and heirloom tomatoes on the side. a treat for vegetarians and carnivores alike! wood grilled broccoli  this was very different but i could not stop eating it! the smell was incredible! the crispies were my least favorite part of the dish  they appeared to be rice krispy cereal and did not add much to the dish. pan fried shishito peppers  this was my least favorite of the dishes we ordered, but it was also probably because the first two peppers i picked were the hot ones. i did not notice the miso taste at all, though the parmesan and sesame seeds were caked on the outsides of the peppers. sweet potato pierogis  these were a little treat! fluffy filling in a light dough with avocado creme and tasty accompaniments. solid dish. peanut butter and jellywich  well, this was very interesting! we would planned to stop somewhere else for dessert but after the dessert menu was dropped at the table, we were so intrigued that we gave it a whirl. wow, was it zippy! the sponge cake and concord grape sauce that had almost a spicy, tingly aftertaste! with crunchy peanut brittle, brown butter bread ice cream and torched peanut butter marshmallow. yum! service by owen was topnotch! as we would both traveled in that day, we were exhausted and opted not to order alcohol. he never made us feel bad or cheap for choosing just to drink water. he also had a lot of enthusiasm, steered us in the right direction with some of the dishes and made small talk in between. thanks, owen! only bad thing i can say is that the music was very, very loud, though it was very late at night  maybe they tone it down during the day."
642,Fred A.,1126,5,10/22/17,"the first time i came here, i thought it was one of the best meals of my life. this is hard to top a second time around, but i was still pretty blown away. and i am not even that big of a goat fan  blasphemy, i know. roasted beets was a cool take on a beet salad. sishito peppers were as good as sishito peppers always are. wood grilled broccoli was good. hamachi crudo was pretty yum. the pig face was really very interesting but not as great as i was hoping. the goat empanadas were really good, something about the empanada casing and the sauces on top really complimented the goat well. the goat belly itself sort of got lost among everything else on its plate. i was really impressed by the pork shank  definitely mvp, the buttermilk dressing and radish kimshi really added some good texture and interesting flavors. this place knows what it is doing, and it is running on all cylinders. props to all hands on deck. a musthave for anybody in chicago."
643,Danielle C.,1126,5,8/7/17,"i have heard people say this place is too hyped up. wrong. it is amazing. we ordered wood grilled broccoli  delicious! crisp braised pork shank  came highly recommended by our waiter and it was incredible! by far my favorite item. everything from the warm naan, to the flavorful sauces, to the kimchi, to the perfect cooked meat had me raving. goat empanadas  good, but would not order again. blueberry cornbread  another great option! i know some people wait months to get a rezzie here, but we just rolled in on a sunday night and sat at the bar."
644,Bernie P.,1126,4,7/28/17,"we really enjoyed this meal, and, for the quality, the prices were good. the atmosphere has lots of energy and some noise.  also, i consider this on the casual end of the spectrum for this level of quality. i suggest about two dishes per person. the standouts for me were the escargot ravioli  and surprisingly the wood  grilled broccoli . also, the goat shank was very solid and does not have that typical goat aftertaste  very tender and well prepared. i did not have room for dessert. also, as mentioned, in the title, the old fashioned was an awesome treat and was well balanced with both bourbon and rye, which is typically one or the other. i would definitely return if i could get a reservation at a time that worked. the food is a cut above at this price point, and the atmosphere is fun. i would not consider it intimate or appropriate if you are looking for a highend, traditional dining experience."
645,Andy V.,1126,5,7/20/17,"what more is there to say about a restaurant that has over six thousand reviews on yelp with a near perfect rating? well, i am going to add to the notion that girl & the goat is simply perfection. okay, before i begin. you must, must, must make a reservation. you must make it months before you plan on going here. it is that big of a deal. i have been twice and we made our reserverations about two to three months in advance. it is crazy, but needed. the inside is beautiful. somewhat dimly light. the back wall is the kitchen. wooden accents. it feels swank without all the gloss and frills. you know you are someplace special when you are inside. now the most important thing the food. the food comes tapas style so it is always a good idea to order and share at the table. or be like me and order three things for yourself. some of my favorite food items are roasted cauliflower it is got peppers picked peppers, pine nuts and mint. i did not think i would like the mint, which you can definitely test, but it gives the cauliflower a nice textured flavor. wood grilled broccoli  bleu cheese and these amazing little cripsy things delicious. you will never look at broccoli the same way again. all of their featured breads are delicious. all of their breads are delicious. you will not be upset with any of the bread choices, but i will say i am the biggest fan of the bread with jam i am a simple man, what can i say? oysters a i had my first ever pork cheek here which was amazing. soft and chewy and tasty and i devoured it. listen, everything here is good from their speciality cocktails to their meals. the servers are amazing. they will walk you through the entire menu, giving you pointers along the way. anything i have gotten from a waiter suggestion, like the pork cheek, was a great choice, so listen to them. so make your reservation now and in a few months when you are able to go you will thank me!"
646,Mariko K.,1126,5,7/4/17,"food pan fried shishito peppers parmesan. sesame. miso  solid wood grilled broccoli  rogue smokey bleu. spiced crispies  best brocolli of my life! escargot ravioli bacon tamarind sauce. escarole and celery. crispy onions  i did not like the celery, it overpowered the dish goat empanadas avocado smash . grilled pineappleblueberry salsa. queso fresco  aokay chocolatey  chocolate cake shiitake gelato  amazing, the toffee creme fraise perfectly topped it and i loved the savoriness of the shiitake the two worked well together rhubarb & goat cheese bavarian hazelnut crunchy. herbs  delicious savory, herby, sour, and tart. all things i normally do not like, but worked well together here. cocktails  both were good! mahalo don q silver . plantation pineapple rum . guava . pink peppercorn . lime . mezcal salt & ash benhez mezcal . ancho reyes verde . kings ginger . grapefruit shrub . lime"
647,Mandy F.,1126,4,6/16/17,"i was excited to try out new things in chicago, but was warned to make reservations for this place online in advance. so i just clicked for reservations for a pm table for , about  months in advance. it was nice that they also made a phone call about two days before the reservations so we would be reminded that we had a table. walking in the place is dimmed and packed and super busy sitting down the tables were a bit tight and i almost hit the table behind me. oopsies what we ordered roasted cauliflower  this was good. a different take on your usual cauliflower wood grilled broccoli  nice texture and it was cooked perfectly sauteed green beans  this was okay. was not special to me seared diver scallops  only had two pieces, which was a bummer. scallops were cooked just right. pan roasted halibut  not a fan of this. was a bit disappointing to the table. duck tartare  this was my favorite one out of all the dishes! the waiter said it won awards too, and you can easily taste the dish and understand why that happened! lamb ribs  i personally do not like lamb, but this was cooked nice and fell right off the bone. the sauces were good and the meat was nice and juicy. goat empanada  i did not try this but my table liked it. alcohol  good drinks, but seemed a bit water downed paid about  for  people and left just full"
648,Michele S.,1126,3,6/14/17,"i came here back in late april for an anniversary dinner for  people. the only reservations that were available were pm or pm so we took the early bird special time. when we arrived it was half full at pm! we got to our table right away and was anxious to try some great dishes. we were probably the only ones out of our friends who have not tried girl & the goat so we had a lot of friends who made recommendations prior to our visit. unfortunately, when we sat down we were waiting for our waiter for about  minutes. thankfully the individuals who filled our water saw us getting anxious and started to walk around looking for our waiter which he arrived shortly after. he was very lack luster when he arrived at our table but was nice enough to give us his recommendations and popular dishes. we ordered wood grilled broccoli , seared diver scallops, what is the deal yo bread, pigs face to be honest my favorite thing was the wood grilled broccoli and the scallops. my bf thought the pigs face was the best and it was one of the most recommended item on the menu from friends. the pigs face looked great but something was missing like spice that would be more of my palate. i wish it was easier to get a reservation here but i plan on coming back another time and try different items on the menu. i do not think it was the most amazing experience but i think it would be worth a try if you are curious."
649,Kelly C.,1126,4,6/5/17,"best for last? it is debatable... definitely best social dining experience i have ever had with strangers. read on for details. when i knew i was going to visit chicago, it was a requirement to visit g&tg. stephanie izard has been my favorite top chef since her first appearance and just to dine in one of her restaurants has been a dream of mine. i showed up, sans reservations, and was able to find a place at the bar extension. my waiter gave me a menu and put a dot next to which items could be ordered in halfsizes. he suggested that i order four things, so i ordered  sauteed green beans half order  wood grilled broccoli half order  springy focaccia  goat empanada half order the man next to me had also ordered the green beans and i realized once his were delivered that a half order would be way too much for me. i jokingly said that we should have shared one order, and he agreed. a few minutes later, another man sat down across from us, also on his own and sitting at the bar. after my next course was delivered, a woman sat to my right and the four of us started chatting. i shared my broccoli and focaccia with our group and we all tasted sips of each others drinks. slowly but surely, we added to our ragtag group of misfit toys until there were  of us passing our apps and drinks, insisting that everyone get a bite of this or that. not counting the drinks, by the end of the night i had also tasted  shishito peppers  escargot ravioli  seared diver scallops  duck tartare  blueberry bourbon baba ....and so many others that i forgot to write down. it got to the point where even our fearless bartender started throwing extra servings our way to accommodate the growing crowd of strangers. this was, by far, the most expensive meal i have ever eaten solo. granted, i did spend  on spices to bring home and another  on drinks, so i guess it actually was not that expensive. i know firsthand now why stephanie is both a top chef and iron chef victor. these bites were delectable and my only regret is that it will be a while before i can try them again."
650,Jolynn K.,1126,5,3/9/17,my daughter took me here for dinner. we started with the clam chowder bread then for dinner we split the wood grilled broccoli and crisp braised pork shank. we were stuffed. everything was delicious but we both got tummy aches later in the evening.
651,Geoffrey B.,1126,4,2/22/17,"we had an impressive  course meal and one of the private rooms downstairs. we started off with the assorted house baked breads and the warm marinated olives. first and second course was the kohlrabi salad with fennel and roasted shiitake mushrooms.next we had the goat empanadas and panfried shishito peppers, followed by the wood fire shrimp and chickpea fritter. we then had  family style serving of the following plates roasted cauliflower, blackened catfish, the sauted green beans, wood grilled broccoli and last but not least the crispy braised pork shank. everything was excellent and finished off with a selection of desserts."
652,Christopher V.,1126,5,1/30/17,"it is rare to find a restaurant that does everything well. service, appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks all come together at the peak of excellence with girl & the goat. i am big on self reflection, so i can humbly own up to being a tough critic when it comes to food. trying so many restaurants, has created a standard that can be difficult to meet. late night convenience aside. ..i try not to hit the same spot twice, unless i find a dish that revolutionizes they way i view food. g&tg is clearly a standard bearer for elevated dining, not just in chicago but anywhere in the us. reservations are a challenge without proper planning, or a little luck unless you are open to pm on a weeknight. the popularly has not driven g&tg to pompous pretentiousness found at some of the highly celebrated restaurants in chicago. the menu has been fairly consistent during my last several visits excluding subtle changes due to seasonality. my personal favorites are the wood grilled broccoli , pan roasted catch of the day, grilled ramp marinated shrimp and of course the caramel corn & malt balls. the salt & ash is a well balanced cocktail if you enjoy the smokiness of mezcal. i could go on about other amazing dishes, the strikingly creative paintings or attentive service, but just trust they all make for a hard to beat experience."
653,Christine A.,1126,5,1/29/17,"one of two restaurants i have urged people to try when in chicago. you can book a spot on open table or just go early. we arrived at  and were seated immediately. the menu is impressive. your server will tell you that four people can split  dishes. do not believe it! we split  fabulous dishes and were stuffed like porky pigs. we began with the crisp braised pork shank, simply divine, and the grilled baby octopus which was incredible. but my favorite was a fabulous and beloved dish the bourbon butter goat belly! my oh my. to die for. all the goaty, buttery bourbony flavors knocked my socks off. our other dishes, wood grilled broccoli and grilled shrimp were yummy as well. everything was spectacular and we will not hesitate to return to see the girl do her thing with her goat! apparently, no one sleeps as the restaurant is open all. day. long."
654,GT W.,1126,5,1/21/17,"reservations required well in advance. this is a shared plate experience and every dish we tried was outstanding. we made reservations over a month in advance and the only seating available was pm. pretty crazy that they even have full dinner service that late. we arrived on time and hit the bar for a few minutes while the table was prepped. the interior is impressive, dark lighting with dark wood and exposed rafters. it is one giant, highceilinged room but is broken up nicely into different partitions. once seated, the menu looked focused and inspired with everything worthy of ordering. the setup is sort of like tapas, or shared small plates. our server suggested we shoot for about  items,  per person. the bread and butter were phenomenal  exceptional really [a]. wood  grilled broccoli was similarly outstanding [a]  this was my wife's favorite. we did an octopus as well as a beef heart dish that were delicious. the confit goat belly with lobster and crab was an interesting mix that surprisingly worked very well. decadent in every way. our service was very good throughout the evening. i think it was certainly worth the hype. i would return in a heartbeat."
655,Andrea M.,1126,1,10/20/18,"my girlfriend and i came here right at opening  pm and sat at the bar since we did not have a reservation. we ordered the pig face and lamb ribs, which were both good, but that was where the good things about this restaurant ended. this was the absolute worst restaurant experience either of us have ever had, the bartenders were beyond rude and condescending. as soon as we told the bartender we would not be ordering any drinks, she glared at us and proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time we were there while being extremely friendly to the people next to us who were spending hundreds. someone needs to teach the servers that they need to treat everyone with respect, not just the rich customers. would never come back or recommend to anyone."
656,Suby B.,1126,1,9/26/18,"a very unsatisfied visit of the past. we will not return. robot waitress. got the order wrong. made sure she charged us for hash browns she forgot to bring. god only knows what she was doing, food took f o are e v e are to come out. in pieces, if i may add. my sister used a knife to stir in her coffee options cream  sugar. another waitress was kind enough to overhear our conversation and apologized and brought us utensils of proper nature. the scone was delicious. apple juice was a gourmet bottled juice. yummy. but, nope. not a breakfast joint for us. distasteful. i do commend the managerowner for writing back to us and inviting us back to join her for a meal on her, but that was a pretty horrific visit, and since, we decided not for us again. however, it is a beautiful joint, well lit, gorg breakfast bar area, very inviting, and is just stunning! dining out is my life and i love good food and service. it is how i take care of my family, friends and clients it is how i expect to be taken care of as well. not some cockyjock behavior at a beautiful restaurant. just makes everything ugly. sad."
657,Sue W.,1126,1,9/10/18,horrible foods! i have been to so many restaurants around the world. this is the top  most overrated restaurant. we came to visit from california. we saw the . star from thousands of people. we were so excited and made  months reservations in advance. everything was so salty. we could not even finish because salt. it was horrible and very disappointed. will definitely not come back and recommend to anyone.
658,Chris I.,1126,1,8/2/18,"we left before we could be seated, because the music was way too loud. too bad, because they have an interesting menu and decor.  i would have liked to have tried a goat dish. i like to chat with my dinner companions, and that would have not been at all possible in this restaurant."
659,Cathy B.,1126,1,7/27/18,"for the host that picked up the phone x at different times and say it is an hour wait. uber there, just so they can say kitchen have issues with gas cannot cook food. could have told us over the phone."
660,Rob C.,1126,1,7/25/18,"over rated! made. reservations  month from advanced. had to wait over  minute be seated , the food arrived after one hour  manager claimed they would de a mistake with our order ... . the bill arrived and it was all in , even that we had to wait that long . used to be a regular there but so disappointed!"
661,Alon B.,1126,1,7/17/18,"now we know why it is hard to get a table there. nobody picks up the phone ever! we made a reservation a month ago for this sunday but i forgot the time so i called nobody picks up. i left a message. called again, left a message. next day they calling me to help me further with my request. i told them this was for yesterday !!! very unprofessional."
662,Jimmy W.,1126,1,7/16/18,"good food, terrible service and terrible atmosphere. patio outside? do not kid yourselves  it is a cafeteriastyle communal table. it gets better though  wait till the evening critters arrive, you will have to decide whether to eat, swat insects away, or take turns doing either one. they have literally one waitress managing the tables outside so i guess we cannot blame the employees solely. need more drinks? savor your current ones until the staff find the time or desire to take your next order. advice? get the food to go. enjoy the food without the forgettable dining experience."
663,Anoosh N.,1126,1,7/16/18,my husband and i got sick after eating here! i know people love this place but i just do not feel the same way.. the food is very unique and has very nice textures but it is more experimental to me and less about the taste.
664,Kimberly K.,1126,1,7/12/18,high  over rated restaurant do not recommend. well if you do not know where to go you can maybe try here. everyone have own taste butt!!! but if your foodies looking after chefs own restaurant person. i do not recommend!!!! good luck hope this review will help someone!
665,Fei D.,1126,1,7/8/18,"bad experience with parking!!! do not park outside the restaurant, there is city's parking lot nearby. food is good but not worth it! will not go again!"
666,Fernando G.,1126,1,7/7/18,"food is overrated. it is not worth the price that is the reason i give a  star. i got the pork shank and goat empanadas. they both ordinary. with a little of fruit  veggie on the side, no huge differences are there. the texture of empanadas is below average. the sauce for the pork shank is disappointing."
667,Michael N.,1126,1,7/3/18,worst table after waiting  mins past our reservation. sat right behind host table up against the bar half with people in the bar standing over us.  hosts were bumping up against my chair all during dinner. a gaggle if loud girls were hanging over the bar partition looking down at our table. they were shouting and we could not even hear each other talk. horrible experience. we have been loyal to all of the goat restaurants for years you would think their reservation system would recognize loyal customers and treat them with some special attention or even any recognition really bad experience.  will not be back.
668,Tia H.,1126,1,6/25/18,"i honestly do not understand the hype and  star reviews for this restaurant. the overpriced food is mediocre, and the service is absolutely horrible. i am beyond disappointed in this place and am confused at how they have maintained such high ratings. perhaps because the restaurant is located in the west loop which is an area of people trying too hard to be with upandcoming trends so the items on the menu matches to the whole west loop vibe, however, all i saw was disappointment. the only plus i would give this place is the music and atmosphere. i went to this restaurant on a saturday evening and had a reservation for three people. my friends and i come from la, miami, and nyc so we understand the importance of reviews and thought that such high reviews for this place was worth us giving it a shot. we were wrong. when we sat down, we asked the waitress if they served sangria. she responded, no, this is not a spanish restaurant. her ignorant response from the getgo changed the mood for my friends and i. there are many testaurants who serve sangria and are not spanish. it was a simple and fair question we asked. not only that, but this place serves goat empanadas as well as many other small plates that have a huge spanish influence on their menu... in addition to the poor service, this place needs to stop promoting the whole concept of sharing the meals because they aren absurdly small. there is nowhere on the menu that markets the small plates as tapas so that is misguiding for someone who is looking to actually enjoy a thorough meal without having to spend  plus becusee they have to get  small plates to make it one full meal. my friends and i who do not normally eat that much ended up ordering  plates each for ourselves and when we left, we went to another restaurant called au cheval which is right across the street to eat our actual dinner. i ordered the bluepoint oysters for appetizer and they were bland for oysters that were seasoned and cooked. i ordered the goat liver with bread and that was also bland. their sauces were not bad but the goat liver had no flavor. i ordered the salmon dinner and that was so small i had to order another plate so i got the half grilled chicken emphasizing half a chicken which ended up being chopped into  very small pieces. the grilled chicken was good but for a main course meal, the small portions should have been served as an appetizer as the size of the chopped half chicken are bite sizes. each time our meals would be served to us, they would put it in the middle of the table and we would tell the staff, no this is just for me, the staff would still place it in the middle of the table and walk away immedtiately as if they were annoyed with us. i get itthe restaurants philosophy is sharing but how in the world can you share a plate that takes one to two bites to finish?! after all of that, my friends and i were still hungry so we asked for our check and left. i see this restaurant being raved and highly spoken of for maybe another year or so but i have a feeling the reviews will go lower as the prices and services does not validate for the quality of the food. they need to make this known as a full tapas restaurant and stop the whole sharing of the meals. our bill for three people ended up being . unless you have eaten before heading to this place, do not care for the rude service, and are just in the mood to spend a lot of money to listen to music and people watch...otherwise, please, please, avoid this place and go somewhere else. i promise you it is not worth for what you pay for."
669,Laura P.,1126,1,6/24/18,not worth the hype! only good thing was the little goat latte and that is because they used goat milk as opposed to regular milk. food was below average.
670,John B.,1126,1,6/5/18,"i do not mean to be a party crasher, but this place is essentially overrated and largely overpriced. the one star is for the service, which was on point. the food on the other hand... perhaps my expectations were a little high coming in. the shishito peppers were served with a kind of creamy sauce and parmesan cheese. ok i should have seen this one coming. but seriously ?!? parmesan cheese on shishito peppers? maybe next time with bacon and bread crumbs? the lamb ribs were nothing but a delicious piece of fat on a bone, with a subtle sweetysavory glaze. no meat whatsoever.  for spiced up lamb fat. take that, bbq joints. the bucattini were good, a little too tikka masalai to my taste. not worth the  for a tiny portion anyway. sorry girl, no more goat for me "
671,Gil A.,1126,1,6/3/18,the portions were too small and the service very slow. for the price the place is not worth it.
672,Andrew M.,1126,1,5/29/18,"overpriced, uninteresting food served by unfriendly waiters. why people wait months to go here is a mystery."
673,Deirdre R.,1126,1,5/17/18,"honestly, i have never written a review for any restaurant before but i felt the need for this one. this place is way overpriced for their portion sizes. they stress that it is family style dining but you would have to order at least  menu items for an average four person family to be full. most things on the menu appear to be for one person or at most, two thinner individuals. overall, i would not recommend this restaurant to families unless you are willing to drop at least  on a not so satisfying dinner."
674,Ming X.,1126,1,4/7/18,"if you do not have a reservation which is impossible to get, you have the option of sitting at the bar or at the lounge. it is called first come, first serve. however, there is no system to justify who first came, and who gets serve first. it is a chaos. people end up standing behind you and watching you eat. if you choose eating at the lounge, you will have a group of strangers share a tiny table. servers are nice and helpful. the food is creative and fresh, but not deserve a second trip."
675,Lina S.,1126,1,3/13/18,"they have really great drinks i will give them that. the service is mediocre. i ordered off the vegan menu and let the server know that i am vegan and would like the vegan burger. she ordered off the regular menu for some reason and my food was not vegan at all. i got sick from the food and she was pretty unapologetic! she said 'i thought vegan was just a preference for you and not your diet'. whether it is a preference or not, there is a reason why i let her know that i am a vegan and i want to order the vegan burger off the vegan menu. i have a  gift card for this place...but i never want to go back!"
676,Thomas C.,1126,1,1/30/18,"i would let my family starve before i brought them to this over priced craft beer snobbatorium.  while the food was excellent the arrogance of the proprietor and her your welcome for eating my food attitude is too much for this guy. again, great food but with all the amazing places to eat in chicago, i should never be made to feel like it is a privilege to patronize a restaurant and spend my hard earned money."
677,Julianne C.,1126,1,1/29/18,"honestly do not think this is worth the months and months ahead reservation and small portioned, yet expensive small plates though some were indeed quite tasty. for  people, our bill was around  and we had to stop at mcdonald's afterward due to still being hungry"
678,Reagan S.,1126,1,12/29/17,"yuckkkkk. aside from this chef being famous, why is this such a popular spot? what am i missing? just moved to chicago, and everyone said i had to come here. from the food to the service to the drinks, misses the mark every which way. the food is so overthetop trying to be something it is not. easy, stephanie."
679,Weiler S.,1126,1,12/4/17,you cannot hear in this restaurant. the poor waitress could not even hear us to take our orders. the food was ordinary but our group did not enjoy the space because of the loudness and our hearts went out to the poor waitstaff.
680,Jenny H.,1126,1,11/15/17,"i have never written a review before, i downloaded the yelp app just to get my experience across i am absolutely and utterly disappointed. i had this reservation for over  month, totally excited about this famous experience. while, disclaimer the food was very good... i walked out so dumbfounded by my service or lack thereof. i immediately informed my familyfriends i will certainly never be back and feel totally ripped off. again, after placing this rez two months agotonight, my boyfriend and i were seated at a table that was essentially in the kitchen. beware! we both wished we would have spoken up but felt too bad making a fuss. this table was an extension of essentially the area where waiters put in their ordersnot more than  foot from the chefs and stoves. it was so loud and so unbelievably hot we were both sweating by the end of the meal. and, could not hear each other for the life of us. i sent my drink back because it was not what i ordered and received an eye roll from our waiter, who had not been to our table more than twice before this ... keep in mind, our meal was finished. twice in about one hour. i waited so long for my girl & the goat experience and truthfully, i think our waiter forgot about us at this makeshift table. i could not believe they would seat someone there and we are not picky, especially because we were not walkins! will be most certainly telling more people about our terrible experience. i am infuriated and disappointed. money wasted on a hot, loud, illserved time... completely clouding good food."
681,Tanicka S.,1126,1,10/27/17, hour wait. we had a limited time to eat due to previous reservations running late food is not a part of our taste profile both experiences reflected left a negative taste for my boyfriend and i.
682,Peter T.,1126,1,9/28/17,meh. ok quality food... but they are definitely pushing it as far as possible on portion size. i would take a pass. far better to be found in chicago! i feel this place takes advantage of people... but the flavor was pretty good... still not worth it. edit left there... went to green market meat bbq just go there. awesome!!!! could have eaten like a king there for same money and amazing flavor. avoid this small plate place. i am skeptical of the reviews for this place. i am not seeing it at all.
683,robin w.,1126,1,7/25/17,"been there done that. small small portions, big big prices. so much ambiance you cannot hear the conversation at your own table. great chef  just not good experience."
684,Philip M.,1126,1,6/23/17,over hyped. will seat you in the kitchen to maximize revenue. food was lack luster.
685,Francine C.,1126,1,6/8/17,"terrible peasant food. pork bellies and raw duck, although somewhat of a delicacy  you definitely need a stomach for this place. i usually eat clean so after i ate a few dishes i had to leave"
686,David W.,1126,1,6/2/17,"your shop is racist, you need to get rid of your host! he gives me and my friend a rolling eyes and cold shoulder when we ask for getting a seat for two hours wait which we are totally fine waiting for it. do not get snubbish , you are not making food into golds"
687,T F.,1126,1,5/31/17,"i just do not get it. tried it out three times. food was not great, most dishes overly salted. atmosphere was too loud to hold conversation. great, pig face. i guess it is cool if you have not tried many foods. pork cheeks, other parts of the head used by many cultures. sulz in austria, sultze in germany, testa en cassetta in italy. g&g's is not quite meat in aspic, but saving bits of food nonprime cuts and turning them into something delicious is as old as the hills. problem is, g&g misses on most dishes on the delicious part. over hyped."
688,A M.,1126,1,5/31/17,overrated in a big way. the combos of mains and sides do not work. the dishes do not even look good. i do not understand why anyone goes to this place.
689,Luke H.,1126,1,5/28/17,"way overrated! food is over priced and the portions are very small. my fianc and i went to this place based off of trying their sister restaurant duck duck goat, which is fabulous! but this place was nothing to brag about, the food is not accurate based off the menu description. we ordered the crispy pork belly and it came served on yellowtail sashimi. no where in the description did this small plate say it was served with fish, my fianc does not eat any seafood so this was a huge surprise to her and i. overall the reviews are not an accurate description of the experience we had, waste of  we will not be back."
690,Nicole K.,1126,1,5/28/17,"sad to say this place is way overrated. went here after visiting duck duck goat, which blew us away, and we were beyond disappointed. we ordered fried pork belly in which does not mention anywhere on the description that it is served on sashimi. that is a huge deal. i do not eat seafood, so it would have been nice to know. that being said the pork belly was literally an inch long and the width of a pencil. ridiculous. our server then compared pierogis to empanadas. how can you be a server in one of the hottest restaurants and compare a polish dish to a spanish dish? i am polish so this is laughable. the restaurant is decorated nicely, but i definitely would not go back."
691,Andrew H.,1126,1,4/2/17,one of the most over rated places ever. did not like one thing. this is one of those places that is trendy but very disappointed in food. supposed to be a hip cool joint but the food sucks
692,Maroua K.,1126,1,3/26/17,"honestly one of the worst experiences of my life!! came here with a date who tried to make a reservation on thursday for friday night! he was told he would not need a reservation since we were looking to come in around pm. fine! he arrives before i do at pm on the dot and asks if he can get a table for , he is told it is going to be a couple hours wait!!!???? what?? why on earth were we refused to book a table the day before & why on earth were we told we would be guaranteed a table upon entry?? puts his name down for a table and heads to the bar, i texted him from my cab on route to the location and asked him to ask the bartender if they served sangria because god forbid it is a beautiful day out in chicago and i fancy a nice cold, refreshing drink! gets the dirtiest look from the bartender as if to say if it is not on the cocktail list i am not making it upon my arrival, i sit down and was greeted at the bar by  of the most miserable, unwelcoming, grouchy, judgy and down right rude bar tenders i have ever had the displeasure of meeting! i had my heart set out on sangria so i needed a minute to decide on an alternative which pissed off this girl so much she literally rolled her eyes at me and walked away. she never came back to me to find out if i would decided on something so i had to call on the other male bar tender to attend to me! got our drinks, about  minutes later i am feeling extremely parched and realise i do not have any water! not only through experience, bar tenders pour you a glass of water the second you sit down and are glancing over the menu, but out of  people sitting at the bar, my date and i were the only  who were not offered water!! this guy was re filling the water glasses of the couple to our left and our right, casually without taking the time to care that we did not have any water glasses to top up!! when i asked him for some water, he did not apologize for not giving us any, honestly felt like i would just asked him to give up both his kidneys for me seriously it was so uncomfortable!!!  painful and excruciating hours later, we had already agreed that there was no way in hell we were staying there for food, which might i add we planned to have at pm not !!!!!!! we kindly declined our table and asked for the cheque, we paid but before leaving my date stayed at the bar polishing off his drink while he looked after my bag, coat etc. apparently while i was gone he was asked to move!!!!! oh my goodness me can you imagine!! just because we would checked out, my date was still sitting down when the bar man looked over at  women who were drinking behind us all night and said to them and i quote ladies these seats here are for you, sorry about the wait these next drinks are on me are you effing kidding me!! we were only sat at the bar waiting on a table we thought we were going to be given upon entry because they refused us a reservation, treated us like absolute scum, gave us the dirtiest looks all night & now to top it off you are belittling us in front of other customers playing good cop opting to treat them with the courtesy and respect you should have treated us with?? my blood is boiling i cannot even tell you! i am never stepping foot in here & will make sure everyone i know does not either!!! shocked, disappointed and absolutely sickened by this experience!!! ps. vegetarians, this is not the place for you! but if you enjoy eating pig faces, duck tongues, and fancy being bullied and belittled by bartenders then"
693,Jennifer A.,1126,1,1/6/17,"possibly my favorite restaurant in chicago. ruined tonight by the girl behind the bar with a shockingly bad attitude. rude, inconsiderate and abrasive. ignored us to talk with her friend at the bar, used ridiculously bad language in front of our kids and basically made us feel like we were inconveniencing her by ordering drinks."
694,John S.,1126,1,12/24/16,"i know i am in the minority here, but i thought this place was way overhyped. take it with a grain of salt since i do not like olives and they are everywhere here, but i will not be going back anytime soon."
695,Jason A.,1127,5,11/9/18,"let us me start off my saying this place was all the reviews raved about! from good service to amazing food, i would not second guess myself on giving this place  stars. my only tip to people planning on visiting this place for breakfast is to get there early or put yourself on the waiting list before you leave your hotel. my girlfriend and i got there at around . upon arriving, we made our way through the revolving door and was welcomed by a huge amount of people waiting by the entrance to escape the cold, brisk morning air. after putting my girlfriend and i on the waiting list, i received a text confirming that we were added to the list and would be notified when to come back to the restaurant. considering this place was across from millennium park, we walked over to kill time which in my opinion was great because there was no one at the cloud so it was a great time to take pictures. about  minutes later, my girlfriend received a text to make our way back to the restaurant. once we checked in with the hostess, we waited another  minutes. once we were seated, we were greeted by a very nice waitress who asked us what we would like to drink as we also asked what she would recommend. she was very knowledgable in terms of product knowledge. okay let us get on to the food. all you need to do is look at the picture attached. it says it all. the food looked as good as it tasted. highly recommend upgrading your side to the speciality pancakes! they are delicious! everything about this place was great from the service, to the food, to the turn over time the waiters are so quick to clean tables and take away your empty plates. thank you wildberry for an amazing breakfast experience in chicago."
696,Diego M.,1127,5,11/6/18,"bottom line great breakfast lunch spot, go long line had a great time here. the lines are long for good reason. the food is absolutely delicious. i forget the name of my dish, but as pictured it was huge and had hashbrowns, eggs, the works. my friend got their special pancakes and they too were amazing. service was quick and friendly. i would definitely return."
697,Milen H.,1127,4,11/6/18,"such a great breakfast place! me and my friends came here for breakfast and naturally we each ordered our own dish. the portions here are huge!! the three of us could have just ordered and shared one entree and a stack of pancakes. we ordered the wildberry pancakes which was good! for me, it was a little too sweet for me but the texture of the pancake was light and airy! i found myself swiping the sauce to the side. maybe a glass if milk would have balanced out the richness. i ordered the eggs benedict i forgot the exact name but it had spinach and bacon pieces with the hollandaise sauce on the side. it came with hash browns as well. i only ate  of my  benedict and was stuffed. there was a generous amount of spinach and bacon with a very thick english muffin on the bottom. the egg was cooked perfectly and the yoke broke beautifully on top. service was great and the whole staff was very attentive to our needs and had great suggestions on their extensive menu. come early though! by the time we left around am the front area was packed!"
698,Bell A.,1127,5,10/30/18,"update you know how you update your review and either raise or lower your score? well i am going to leave wildberry at a five because that is how awesome it is. actually, take my previous five, add my current five and make it a ten. i went back the following day like i said i would and was greeted by the lovely hostesses with you are back! of course, i cannot get enough. so this time i wanted both breakfast and lunch. i ordered the turkey pepper jack panini with sweet potato fries and a little berry order of the berry bliss pancakes. the berry bliss pancakes will change your life and have you second guessing if you should order any other type of pancake. do not get me wrong, i am sure all of them are great. but this was is extra extra great. and so was my turkey panini! i was stuffed and could not finish it all. just wishing i could pack up wildberry and bring it back to baltimore with it.  currently kicking myself for ordering the most basic item on the menu egg white omelet with pepper jack cheese, plain pancakes and turkey bacon. do not get me wrong, everything tasted great. actually more than great. actually so good, i am planning my visit back before i leave chicago. i got there a little bit before closing and the restaurant was packed but i was still seated within  minutes. my server was great as well. cannot wait to come back!"
699,Katy Q.,1127,5,11/2/18,"we waited  mins for brunch here and it was worth it!!! i was very happy with my experience here. i got an florence egg benedict and my bf got a mexicana skillet and a psl. the wildberry pancakes came as a side dish with the skillet. the pancakes are pretty and have strawberry bitten, which was very delicious. the portions are huge and we had to bring home some extra. everything was flavorful. the service was fast and friendly. i would totally come back here again. highly recommend!!"
700,Nhi H.,1127,5,10/29/18,"well worth the wait and hype! get on the waiting list via yelp before arriving. normal lunch wait for two is . hrs! ok with that out of the way, the bf and i came here for lunch. on our way over we joined the wait list via yelp, wait time?  hr  minutes, holy... took us  minutes to get there, squeezed past the crowds to check in, and the hostess told us they will text when ready. luckily, you have the beautiful millennium park across the street to sight see, play tourist, work up an appetite, and kill time. text came in which gave me  minutes to get to the front. little did they know, i was already there. lol checked in once again and stood there waiting to be seated  more parties ahead but all got seated quickly. service is fast, there are many servers, bus boys, and hostess. workers are very efficient and good at their job, which keeps the patrons flowing. now to the juicy part, the food  corned beef hash skillet  stars! the corned beef is homemade. comes with hash browns or fruit, toast or pancakes but sub with the berry bliss waffle  but well worth it bc a seperate waffle order will cost you . the corned beef hash was so deliciously flavored, tender, minced, and yet still had a little crunch factor from the mixed in hash.  berry bliss waffle  stars, this dish beats most waffles i have ever eaten. i was very full after finishing my benedicts, but knew i needed to try this beautiful waffle. i ended up eating half the waffle and wanted to order more regardless of how full i was. my boyfriend talked some sense into me and i sadly agreed. . florence benedict  stars, loaded with spinach and bacon bites, topped with a perfectly poached egg, and dressed with a very nice, creamy hollandaise sauce with a hint of lemon. double espressostrong and flavorful orange juice freshly squeezed!"
701,Sara B.,1127,4,11/5/18,i am always appreciative to see a creative vegan breakfast option. the servings are huge! justine was a great server. everyone was on it there! it is definitely worth the wait!
702,Darla E.,1127,5,10/21/18,"i went here for an early breakfast while visiting chicago. i think it is going to be a regular spot for me whenever i am in town. i unfortunately cannot remember our waitress's name but she was really good, quirky and attentive without being annoying. on to my favorite, the food! i ordered the corned beef hash, made in house along with two over easy eggs and a berry bliss crepe. it was so good i am actually thinking about driving back to chicago right now as i write this review. i could eat like this everyday! it was a perfect meal, savory and crunchy from the corned beef sweet and fluffy from the crepe. i left happy and cannot wait to return."
703,Queenie C.,1127,5,10/24/18,"hands down the best pancake restaurant i have ever been in! it was super busy.. we went at  and still had to line up for  mins. but turnover is fast. most of my party ordered the seniors breakfast since they did not have such a big appetite in the morning, but my hubby got their corned beef skillet and upgraded to lemon blackberry pancakes. i ordered the corned beef benedict and it was just amazing. mine came with plain buttermilk pancakes on the side and even that alone was so fluffy and delicious with just some simple syrup. the lemon blackberry pancakes were sooo good. it taste just like the dessert but in the form of a pancake the benedict was perfectly cooked and went amazingly well with corned beef. the skillet was so good with fried potatoes and corned beef. you seriously cannot go wrong with so many choices on their menu. service was fast but i can see why since it is so busy. but it was definitely worth the effort!"
704,Jennifer G.,1127,5,10/15/18,"wow wow wow  the hype is real. i went to have breakfast here with my family for my birthday. all i will say is, you must come and have breakfastbrunch here when in chicago. the location is perfect, the service is awesome all across the board. the food is to die for! they have everything under the sun and for very reasonable prices. the wait is long however you can out your name down through the yelp app beforehand and then you will be notified what time you should go and check in. they have a little coffee shop inside where you can grab a drink while you wait to be called. the food and entire experience was just fantastic. we went to see the famous bean while we waited to be called, it is just up the street. the pancakes were all amazing, the coffee was excellent  try the iced mocha or the hot coconut mocha! the skillets are all to do  the denver , the chilaquiles and mexican scramble with chorizo  omgggg out of this world! i wish they had one here in la."
705,Krizia C.,1127,3,10/13/18,"pancake machine house! if you like pancakes this is the place for you. they have a ton of other items on the menu like eggs, skillets, sandwiches, but the pancakes is what keeps this place rolling. i have literally never seen so many pancakes in one place. all different tops and huge portions!! definitely not a place to go to if you are on a diet! wait times are insane, but luckily you can add yourself to the waitlist so it goes faster. it is also a huge place with indoor and outdoor seating so do not fret. we decided to get good ole fashion brioche toast which was a miss. it was not bad, but definitely not memorable. the guy next to me ordered the famous berry pancakes. amazing looking, but definitely will put you in a sugar coma! this place is a must go for insta worthy food photos. other than that, you are better off hitting a diner where the food is cheaper, less wait, and much better quality."
706,Angela S.,1127,5,10/18/18,"this place is simply amazing! their wait is outrageous to say the least but i rsvp would on yelp and was able to wait very little. the portion size is huge but since every single dish looks and sounds like you must eat it it is pretty much impossible to order only one item off the menu. i can personally vouch for the oreo pancakes, the butcher block skillet, and spinach eggs benedict. will definitely recommend and revisit next time i am in chicago."
707,Gus L.,1127,5,11/5/18,"this is one of best breakfast place in town, i love stopping here when we i am in the chicago area. cannot go wrong ordering anything at this great place. highly recommended"
708,Lyna L.,1127,5,10/9/18,"trying out this place was totally worth it. the place is pretty pack however long or short wait would not matter given the location being by millennium park, that has so much for you to tour and see. once we were seated, our waiter immediately greet us and provide drink recommendation. the drink came out pretty fast and there were plenty of offer to order by from waffles, pancakes, eggs benedict, sandwiches, to salad. and not a single of those foods failed at all. the food were delicious that definitely made the long wait worth it and explain why it is very pack. definitely recommend here if ever around millennium park. great services and amazing food."
709,Grant B.,1127,5,10/14/18,"fantastic  great food, great service. definite must try when in the chicago area. food order veggie omelet with cheddar cheese and no mushrooms, the mexicana hash with scrambled eggs, no meat, and a side of cinnamon roll pancakes. environment typical cafe setup with a lot of people waiting to get seated. they have some outdoor seats as well. verdict the mexicana was absolutely fantastic. great flavors, perfectly cooked and had all the aspects of a breakfast that we wanted eggs, hash browns, veggies, cheese, etc. customer service was phenomenal and their suggestions were on point. reservations you can reserve a spot on the yelp app. it was pretty amazing and an accurate estimate for the wait time. we had a minute wait and were able to explore the park and come back  minutes prior to our estimate and were seated rather quickly. tips reserve space with the yelp app and just relax until your time! next time would try their top rated waffle and berries pancakes."
710,Tara Lynn O.,1127,5,10/14/18,"food is really good here! they have a large assortment of breakfast items. you can put yourself on the waitlist from yelp as there will likely be a wait for saturday or sunday morning. once they said the table was ready & we would have had another ~ min wait or so to sit inside. however, they had outdoor seating available immediately so we did that. i got the breakfast burrito which i really enjoyed. the various pancakes, waffles, crepes that other people got around me also looked good."
711,Ana P.,1127,5,10/2/18,"okay folks, wildberry is worth the hype you have heard from locals, and it certainly was for me! they were packed for breakfast on the wednesday morning of my visit, but luckily, my coworker and i only needed to wait around  minutes to be seated. while we waited, we looked over the menu. i was immediately hooked on the idea of their corned beef hash and since the waitress mentioned i could up charge my side of pancakes for one of their more specialty ones, i knew i could not go wrong with the signature berry bliss. it was a lot of food, but the leftovers were still very good! the fluffy pancakes were so sweet so no need to add syrup and the accompanying fruit was fresh. i loved the berry cream in between the stacks. the corned beef was big enough to share among two diners, so i split it into two meals myself. it was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. i do not think i could do canned corned beef again after having such a fresh batch at wildberry's. the eggs were lofty and i liked mine scrambled since i went with the pancakes over the toast. oh, since the fall menu was out, i also ordered an apple cider. it was warm, tart, and delicious. it is too bad it did not come with free refills. i also never tried it with whip cream, but it was an added layer to this whimsical breakfast treat."
712,Tarek E.,1127,4,10/1/18,"hey this place is definitely worth a visit! plenty of seating and the menu has everything for breakfast and brunch lovers! most eggor omelette dishes are served with a choice of toast or pancakes. a great selection of pancakes with endless topping choices. and who can resist a place that serves soft whipped butter, not those frozen little packages of butter so common in most restaurants! kudos to this place for hiring great servers and keeping the place clean and appealing. see you next time i am in chicago!"
713,Haru Y.,1127,2,10/31/18,"this place is way overhyped!!! i do not understand the yelp ratings this place has. luckily we came on a monday morning around  am so we did not have to wait at all to be seated. we went with the signature bliss pancakes and the corn beef hash. the pancakes were a huge portion of  pancakes. seemed mostly plain with a hidden blueberry here and there. they were topped with some sauces and an abundant amount of fruit on the side. the pancakes were ok, but really nothing special. i prefer my pancakes to be much fluffier. these were more on the side of sticky. the corn beef hash was just terrible. the meat tasted like it came out of a can and honestly just made the whole dish inedible. the rye bread toast that came out on the side was the best part of the dish. i honestly cannot understand all the hype and i would definitely never wait for this place!! there must be better breakfast places in chicago..."
714,Anthony N.,1127,5,10/25/18,my face when the hostess said  minute wait.... i stood outside ready to sulk... then like an aberration the man on the patio said he had a table for any party of  or less. he said anyone! yay! no waiting an hour for food . corned beef hash skillet with pumpkin pancakes...shut the front door... the hash had a crispy bottom..my favorite kind of bottom. and the eggs were over easy with a perfect runny yolk to bathe my potaters in. falls on floor from carb coma. wakes up and finishes off the pumpkin spice pancakes.
715,Kaitlyn M.,1127,5,11/4/18,"you are going to wait regardless & it is worth it! so join the waitlist before you go. you have been warned. i would travel back to chicago just to eat the signature berry bliss french toast again. see photo attached, it does not do it justice but neither do words. in the running for best french toast of my life and i consider myself a french toast connoisseur. i wish i got my food so quickly and had service this good  of other places i have ever eaten where the food is not even as good, mind you. i got on the yelp waitlist on my walk over there and it was about  mins total until i was seated. that said i see other reviews complaining about the attentive service... excuse me, but what?! seriously, are you kidding?! how many restaurants have you been to at capacity at am on a monday with a  minute wait and you can . get your food fast i am talking like ish minutes after ordering . not feel like your server has not come back around in  mins because she is slammed & overwhelmed with  other customers in her section and you let it go bc you feel kinda bad for them? i would not even think that is a realistic expectation and it seems the standard here. if you are blessed to dine here, you have probably already been waiting at least  minutes and are starving they give you menus in line too if you are interested which is cool so you can order right when you sit down. with food this good and a place this busy, you would probably let bad service slide but nope!! they excel! i was by myself and checking it out before i headed to the airport because i could not not go to the best brunch spot in chicago & i am always mindful in those situations they would be making more money off a top or larger party and those people are waiting outside no doubt, but i did not feel rushed at all! i signaled for my check before she was planning to bring it to me. it is really nice that they are properly staffed to keep service moving, clear plates to make space on crowded tables in big parties where people might want to order more look at the pics of menu items & think about the volume of dishes that place must wash in  minutes, to make sure no customer gets overlooked!!or has a bad experience, and flip tables efficiently so you know that waitlist is not falsely longer than it really needs to beimportant!!!. take away a single busboy, or a server, or a line cook, and suddenly people are waiting on their drinks and their checks instead of seeing tourist sites bc their server is also clearing tables, and that waitlist gets longer unnecessarily, and you are losing customers and customer satisfaction. seriously, who hates on great service? personally, i think that is a sign of a great establishment that knows what it is doing and does it well. you impressed me wildberry, i will be back!"
716,Meg W.,1127,5,11/3/18,was visiting chicago and picked this place for brunch. wow was it worth the wait. if you put your name in online it is super easy to plan your morning around your spot in line. service is great and the food comes out super quickly. i got the signature berry bliss waffle and i would give my first born child to have something that good every day. wow.
717,Flor P.,1127,5,10/19/18,"amazing breakfast we had here! we did have to wait mins for the table but it was worth it. service is very good and plates are big. me and my boyfriend ordered the signature berry bliss , the eggs benedict and an extra of bacon. also, the vanilla berry coffee was good. do take into consideration the time before you come because of the amount of people here!"
718,Jen M.,1127,5,10/12/18,"corned beef hash with hash browns , eggs and pancakes  be aware these are two person size meals  we also have on the table  corned beef bennie , the signature berry bliss crepes very good! yogurt with granola and corned beef has skillet  the only one able to finish her meal is the one with crepes  very good , hearty , large portions . sorry the pic is not better."
719,Shefali K.,1127,5,10/7/18,"i have been wanting to go to wildberry for a long time now but the  hour wait times have prevented me from going. it just so happened that on a weekday morning i had extra time to kill and decided to give it a try. to my relief, the wait time was only a half hour which is nothing if you know how long the wait time can get for wildberry on a weekend despite having multiple locations. there were  parties ahead of us and we checked in on yelp but wildberry was very quick to accommodate everyone and we got in within the half hour wait time. we were also looking to get in and out quickly as we had a train to catch. our waitress was very accommodating to make sure our order and check was taken care of as quickly as possible. i ordered the signature berry bliss pancakes, turkey sausage and caramel pumpkin spice latte and my boyfriend got the veggie omelette. the signature berry bliss pancakes are as good as everyone says and i am not even a huge fan of pancakes. i usually prefer french toast or waffles. the latte was also delish and the turkey sausage was good too. often times, i find turkey or chicken sausage at restaurants does not taste the same as regular sausage but that was not the case with wildberry. as for whether wildberry is worth the wait times... i do not know. it is good, but i would not wait  hours to get in though certainly worth going if you live in chicago."
720,Ana P.,1127,5,10/2/18,"okay folks, wildberry is worth the hype you have heard from locals, and it certainly was for me! they were packed for breakfast on the wednesday morning of my visit, but luckily, my coworker and i only needed to wait around  minutes to be seated. while we waited, we looked over the menu. i was immediately hooked on the idea of their corned beef hash and since the waitress mentioned i could up charge my side of pancakes for one of their more specialty ones, i knew i could not go wrong with the signature berry bliss . it was a lot of food, but the leftovers were still very good! the fluffy pancakes were so sweet so no need to add syrup and the accompanying fruit was fresh. i loved the berry cream in between the stacks. the corned beef was big enough to share among two diners, so i split it into two meals myself. it was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. i do not think i could do canned corned beef again after having such a fresh batch at wildberry's. the eggs were lofty and i liked mine scrambled since i went with the pancakes over the toast. oh, since the fall menu was out, i also ordered an apple cider. it was warm, tart, and delicious. it is too bad it did not come with free refills. i also never tried it with whip cream, but it was an added layer to this whimsical breakfast treat."
721,Shaun Y.,1127,4,9/12/18,"went to chicago this past weekend with my wife and another couple my brother and his wife. we heard about wildberry and decided to give it a shot. the wait time is super long. i used the line app and it gave me an estimate of about  minutes but actually took closer to an hour and a half. i am told that it can get even longer than that. unfortunately we were seated near the entrance and it was very cold whenever someone opened the door. we had a very pleasant waitress i do not recall her name. i ordered a spiced chai latte and enjoyed it. for my entree i had the southern benedict oven baked biscuits, sausage patties, poached eggs, homemade sausage gravy and hash browns. this was a good dish. the egg was cooked right and overall the dish had decent flavors. i might have enjoyed it more had i not tried my brothers dish. he ordered the los altos benedict chorizo sausage, roasted red peppers, poached eggs, chipotle hollandaise, pico de gallo, and hash browns. man, this was a great entree! tons of flavor especially coming from the chorizo sausage and chipotle hollandaise. the egg was cooked right. we also ordered the signature berry bliss pancakes and cinnamon roll french toast. the pancakes were nothing special at all, surprisingly, given the name of the restaurant. the french toast was good, not great, but easily forgettable. all in all, if i come back it would just be for the los altos benny."
722,Nicole G.,1127,5,9/4/18,"i will keep this short our breakfast was spectacular. i ordered the southern benedict poached egg, sausage, biscuit, sausage gravy and my husband ordered the signature berry bliss crepes. both were huge in portion and prepared perfectly. as a southerner, it is difficult to find expertly prepared sausage gravy... wildberry nailed it. the crepes were filled with and topped with something like  in fresh berries and a delicious marscapone ? creamy filling. insanely good and like no other crepes we have ever ordered. why order pancakes which you can get anywhere when these crepes are available? coffee was decent, service was okay. come and order the crepes and you will not be sorry."
723,Sharon W.,1127,3,9/1/18,"the wait on a sunday for four people was ridiculous. put your name in the no wait app and take a stroll through millenium park while you wait. the menu was quite extensive and there were lots of options. for a pancake place, i was a little surprised by their small pancake menu. i thought there would be more pancake options. a friend and i opted to split a wild mushroom omelet and the signature berry bliss pancakes. the omelet was okay. it was a little plain and bland for my taste. but the pancakes were really good. they were fluffy and had a delicious berry and mascarpone drizzle. i also liked their wildberry orange juice. it was fresh and tart. my friend had an espanola omelet, which i thought was far more delicious than the wild mushroom. all in all, i think the food is good, but not really worth the hour wait. i have had better omelets elsewhere and maybe better pancakes too. i was disappointed because this place did not live up to all the hype i have heard about it. try it out if the wait is not too long one day, but i would not go out of my way or wait  hours for the food."
724,CQ L.,1127,2,8/26/18,signature berry bliss tastes like cheap reduced fat strawberry yogurt. los altos benedict is greasy.  star for the fries.
725,Henry W.,1127,5,8/25/18,"oh my god..i cannot remember the last time i had such an amazing brunch. wildberry literally had me dumbfounded by how good it was. ~ mexicana hash browns, two eggs, cheddar & jack cheese, chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro & onions. this skillet was incredible..perfectly crisp hash browns, melted cheese mixed with hearty chorizo topped with roasted jalapenos for a nice kick. if you are looking for something with a slight kick in spice, i would recommend this one! ~ butcher block hash browns, two eggs, cheddar & jack cheese, ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage & bacon. if you have ever watched parks & rec, this is literally a breakfast that ron swanson would be pleased to eat it is a meat lovers galore. ~ signature berry bliss pancakes soft & fluffy pancakes topped with some beautiful berry concoction. this was sweet & delicious. i was honestly kinda sad when i had my last bite because this was so good.. pls just come here to eat."
726,Ruhi M.,1127,5,8/22/18,this spot is really very famous among all tourist for breakfast and brunch in chicago. if you visiting chicago definitely try this place. long lines to wait but can be best way to start your day. i highy recommended to have there signature berry bliss !
727,Dalena D.,1127,5,8/18/18,"californian traveling to chicago! food  stars you must try this place if you are traveling to chicago! there is a reason why they have k reviews on yelp! my friend and i split in half  orders of food los altos eggs benedict and the slow roast brisket. i ordered the los altos eggs benedict and omg the first bite was a burst of flavors! it was so flavorful that i was sad to trade my friend my other half of the plate! haha the slow roast brisket was also very rich in flavors and the brisket was veeeeery tender! both portions were waaaay to big for  girls...and i eat a lot for a girl lol.the los altos benedict has to be my top pick between these two. because the signature berry bliss pancakes was one of their popular items.... even though we knew we ordered way too much already... we decided to try it anyway hahaha ragrets haha the pancakes were amazing though! super fluffy, fresh fruits, good portion size unfortunately, we were too full to finish it we left this place absolutely stuffed with lots of left overs! if you are traveling from out of this area, i highly recommend you try this place! service  stars join the waitlist! this yelp feature saved my life so many times! the wait was suppose to be  hour and  mins for  people but we waited only  mins because we joined the waitlist from home. there was atleast  people in the waiting area and we bypass all of them! even if you did not put your name on the waitlist, there is plenty of things to do around there to kill time like walk around millennium park. they will text you so hang around because it is definitely worth it! the food takes time to make but that is when you know it is fresh. the wait is worth it!!!!"
728,Lisa S.,1127,5,8/17/18,this is our favorite place for breakfast in chicago. i love the signature berry bliss pancakes. wildberry is always packed but checking in via the yelp app before we left our hotel helped cut our wait time significantly.
729,Chef S.,1127,5,8/16/18,"fantastic breakfast restaurant the service was great, the menu extensive, atmosphere pleasing, and a very friendly staff. an example of the professionalism of the staff at one point during my meal i accidentally dropped my knife a new one, wrapped in a napkin, was provided within seconds. as for the the food, i had the traditional eggs benedict, and my wife had the signature berry bliss waffle. the ham on the eggs benedict was deliciousthe ham was off the bone, not the processed canned variety. the poached eggs were perfectly preparedas i ordered them. my wife was delighted with her waffle. the combination of a crispy waffle, fresh berries , mascarpone cheese, and all the magic drizzle they apply made her very, very happy. so delicious!! keep up the good work."
730,Jesse C.,1127,5,8/7/18,"i love brunch, and this place did not disappoint! the wait is always forever, but it is super convenient that yelp allows you to add your name onto the waitlist without you physically having to be there. this way, you can explore the city while you wait, and just check in when you are instructed to. i ordered the signature berry bliss pancakes, and they are so delicious. definitely recommend!"
731,Eric T.,1127,5,7/30/18,"all i can say is wow! we were excited to try wildberrys after reading the reviews on yelp. it definitely delivered! we got the signature berry bliss  and the los altos eggs benedict . the portion sizes for both were gigantic, so definitely come hungry! the signature pancakes were phenomenal  though i normally do not eat pancakes for breakfast, these ones did justice! the los altos eggs benedict has a mini spicy kick to it, which makes it delicious! both were cooked to perfection. in addition, service was great. protip make a reservation from yelp  minutes ahead of time because they are always busy, especially this location. we arrived following yelps instructions and waited only about  minutes, and were seated immediately."
732,Sara H.,1127,5,7/30/18,"came here on a sunday afternoon from the suburbs. you can join the waitlist which was  hours long through yelp as long as your  miles away from the cafe. i joined it when i got into the city, did some shopping, and by the time i got to the restaurant, exactly  hours later, my table was ready! the yelp app updates you on how many parties are ahead of you and what time you should arrive to the resturant by, also they send you text messages. once we got seated we were given great customer service and the food was delicious. i tried the signature berry bliss french toast and absolutely loved it! my cousin got a garden skillet and we split our food and enjoyed them both! would definitely come back here and recommend when you are in the city!"
733,Jason L.,1127,4,7/30/18,"first stop in chicago after a redeye flight and wildberry did just the trick! i was glad to see wildberry open really early it is a shame that they do not offer breakfast all day since they close at  pm everyday. there is bound to be a wait when you go so i would suggest putting your name on the wait list ahead of time via yelp. i love that feature! we timed our arrival to the restaurant around when our name would be called. talk about efficiency! the portions here are huge. i opted for the butcher block skillet with the signature berry bliss pancakes and i thought it was pretty good. the pancakes were the home run for me. it was like biting out of a cloud! had i known the pancakes would be that good, i would not just ordered pancakes and nothing else. with that said, i appreciated how the skillet kept the dish warm but was not amazed by it. if you are a meat lover, you would enjoy the butcher block but i thought the dish was alright. there are a ton of different meats where you kind of feel overwhelmed by it. wildberry is a great choice for breakfast. if you are planning to come here, i would highly suggest putting your name down on the wait list ahead of time via the yelp app."
734,Brianna V.,1127,5,7/28/18,"yum yum yum! the hype of this place is all real! the food is amazing, best place i ate in chicago during my visit. tip use yelp for the line waitlist, it is very useful, but they seem to get through their waits fairly quick signature berry bliss  this is exactly what they are known for, it comes as pancakes, waffles, and crepes. i am more of a waffle kind of girl, but i am sure having it on any of the other options would be just as amazing! the fruit and berry whipped cream is the perfect combo and and not too street on the waffles, i cannot imagine any other waffles beating these! los altos benedict the chorizo is a bit on the spicier side, but the benedict and hash browns together makes an awesome bite"
735,Bianka G.,1127,5,11/1/18,"ordered eggs with bacon and french toast while my girlfriend ordered the berry pancakes. the latte was great and they even served the drink in a to go cup just like starbucks which is convenient. the waitress was really nice and recommended which entree to try. the place was busy but super clean with a great staff who worked fast to sit us down, take our order and serve us. i will definitely come back as much as i can!"
736,Elizabeth H.,1127,5,10/29/18,we have eaten here many times during our  week stay in chicago. the food and service are awesome! one of my favorites is the french toast !
737,Alfredo Y.,1127,5,10/23/18,"the food definitely was great!!!the sandwich deliciously prepared, french toast exceptionally good, the benedict eggs of my wife were perfect and delicious and the service very good!! thank very much!!!"
738,Joanna A.,1127,5,10/23/18,we did not have to wait too long to be seated. we got lucky! after we sat down it looked like they had a line out the door. after trying all our food i can definitely see why! i had the cinnamon bun french toast my wife had a sandwich that had the most awesome ham on it and the fries man they were so good and crispy!!! my nice had and omelette with hashbrowns and berry pancakes. the hashbrowns could have been crispy but man her pancakes my french toast and her sandwich were phenomenal. i wish i had one of these close to my house i would be here every other day for breakfast. at first i thought the cinnamon french toast would be too sweet but it was the perfect blend cinnamon to suite was not overpowering i actually finished every last drop on my plate. and helped my wife eat her fries and sandwich. service was attentive knowledgeable and super sweet. if you are looking for an overall great lunch or breakfast spot this is definitely the place i would recommend. it deserves over five stars for how amazing the food and service was. to management thank you for an awesome experience i wish i remembered my servers name she was awesome
739,Chelsea P.,1127,3,10/20/18,the huge crowds of people and great reviews has me super excited to try this place... i left a but disappointed  my pumpkin walnut bread french toast was dry. the fresh oj was very good though and the manager was very attentive and friendly when coming around to tables.
740,Monica M.,1127,5,10/12/18,"my friends and i love wildberry. there is usually a long wait, but downloading the app they use to manage reservations is so helpful! anyway, the food is always great even though it is always busy. everything arrives promptly, hot, and delicious. if you are going to the randolph location, ask for jeremy to be your server...he is one of the nicest and funniest servers in, dare i say, all of chicago! you will not regret going here. love the berry bliss french toast !"
741,Jen B.,1127,5,10/9/18,"if i could eat here for breakfast every day, i would. not sure what they put in that wild berry bliss sauce but combined with the french toast it is perfection. if you can get past the long wait times enter the nowait app then there really is nothing to complain about. if i have any advice it is to not waste your time with the savory dishes. sweet is what this place does best. if you get eggs be sure to upgrade the pancakes on the side for one of their sweet specialties."
742,Alexander B.,1127,5,10/7/18,"with generous portions, a wideranging menu, creative dishes, and a stellar wait staff jeremy is the bomb, wildberry  lives up to the hype. we got  dishes and opted for pancakes and french toast for our sides and left full as a party of . my one complaint is that the intelligentsia coffee is not prepared well. i would recommend getting your joe beforehand."
743,John H.,1127,4,10/2/18,"finally made my way over here at a good time when the line is not out the door. their pancakeswaffles and french toast definitely live up to the hype. we came at like  or so on a sunday, when we left there were blobs of people waiting outside. so my advice would be to buckle up and get here early."
744,Elaine O.,1127,4,9/14/18,"took my family here when they were in chicago for my graduation. i have lived in chicago  years and had not been here then. since my friends in chicago either have already been here before, do not want to wait for food, so we always opted for somewhere else. my family came in may on a saturday we came around am because my graduation was at  and we could only do an early brunch schedule to accommodate my family's tight flight schedule back home. it was a short wait probably  mins but it was early. it was super early that day and even though it was may it was a chilly gloomy day so there were no outdoor seating. we all different things, berry bliss pancake, french toast , egg benedicts. the food is your typical brunch place and it was not all that special. honestly brunch food can only be soo good ^^ but it is a nice place to go especially if you are visiting. it is next to millennium park, which is very close to the bean so you can take your visitors around and see the city. it is also nice to be able to take a walk by the park before or after your brunch. parking it is in downtown chicago, there is really only metered parking on the streets wherever you can find. if you get lucky and find free parking spots in downtown please let me know!! because i have been looking for any free parking spots as a longer term resident in chicago and i will be your best friend if you find any...."
745,Boram O.,1127,3,9/13/18,"if you willing to wait for an hr for brunch, this is the place. but it s worth it. they have nice brunch menus. french toasts are the best."
746,Shaun Y.,1127,4,9/12/18,"went to chicago this past weekend with my wife and another couple my brother and his wife. we heard about wildberry and decided to give it a shot. the wait time is super long. i used the line app and it gave me an estimate of about  minutes but actually took closer to an hour and a half. i am told that it can get even longer than that. unfortunately we were seated near the entrance and it was very cold whenever someone opened the door. we had a very pleasant waitress i do not recall her name. i ordered a spiced chai latte and enjoyed it. for my entree i had the southern benedict oven baked biscuits, sausage patties, poached eggs, homemade sausage gravy and hash browns. this was a good dish. the egg was cooked right and overall the dish had decent flavors. i might have enjoyed it more had i not tried my brothers dish. he ordered the los altos benedict chorizo sausage, roasted red peppers, poached eggs, chipotle hollandaise, pico de gallo, and hash browns. man, this was a great entree! tons of flavor especially coming from the chorizo sausage and chipotle hollandaise. the egg was cooked right. we also ordered the signature berry bliss pancakes and cinnamon roll french toast . the pancakes were nothing special at all, surprisingly, given the name of the restaurant. the french toast was good, not great, but easily forgettable. all in all, if i come back it would just be for the los altos benny."
747,Mary W.,1127,4,8/31/18,"first things first, wear comfortable shoes. you will be waiting, but it gives you a chance to talk and catch up before you eat. on the plus side you can take a peek at the plates being brought out by the wait staff. it is been a while since i have been there, but the food is so good. the staff is very helpful and attentive. i ordered the fish and chips. you get a choice of sides if you do not want the fries. wonderful! the next time i return it will be to order the french toast , fully loaded."
748,Shashank K.,1127,5,8/25/18,"the single best place to eat in chicago. the only place i have ever visited that i can say is worth the two hour wait you will find on weekends. download the nowait app to work around that. all omelettes, skillets, sandwiches, french toasts , hot beverages and of course pancakes are supreme"
749,Lisa V.,1127,3,8/25/18,"atmosphere is fine, the place is always busy even at . am which is good for them. corned beef benedict  star . did not feel like i am eating benedict, more like corned beef with poached eggs and bread somewhere deep inside the plate lol. french toast   star . looks good taste fine."
750,Sean B.,1127,5,8/24/18,cynthia was an a kind and attentive server. the chocolate chip banana bread french toast was terrific. joined the waitlist through yelp and was seated as soon as i arrived.
751,Curtis C.,1127,5,8/14/18,"chocolate chip banana bread french toast  it arrives in front of you arrayed in a toppled tower of three generous pieces of banana bread. decadentlooking, you think. what if it is overwhelming? too much sweet? you try it tentatively, cautiously even. it is... fantastic. not too sweet. real banana flavor. soft. smeared with melted chocolate chips and topped with banana slices. you also try it with the syrup too because, why not? to your amazement, also not overly saccharine. sweet, definitely, but not overpoweringly so. you like to get a hit of both sweet and savory, not always together. this time you felt drawn to the corned beef hash and you went for it. you find it quite nice. crispy and browned hashed potato top, with flavorful beef embedded throughout. adding a dash of ketchup gives it a tomato twist, which you do every so often to mix it up. you are freaking stuffed. pleased. boxes to go, please."
752,Daniel C.,1127,4,8/12/18,"great breakfast of french toasts for all four of us, and we all enjoyed our different choices. it was loud in a good urban way, but some of the dish clatter echoed a bit too loud back when we went."
753,Andrea R.,1127,5,5/2/18,"amazing place for breakfast! the menu is very well put together and cohesive. the wait is a bit long, but it is really worth it. plus you get time to look over the whole menu and make the painstakingly hard decision on what to order. i had the classic eggs benedict , which was fantastic. they give you big chucks of ham that were over and inch thick. come hungry!!! they are extremely generous with their servings. the eggs were perfectly poached. my husband had the eggs benedict with the sausage gravy and biscuits, it was really well done. the gravy was the perfect consistency and the biscuits were buttery and light. now upon reading all the reviews it was suggested that we try the berry bliss pancakes, let us not forget that this place is called wildberry pancakes after all. try them!!! our waitress was really fantastic and when we asked about them she said because we both had entrees already she could do a short stack of these pancakes. they were fabulous! just rich and fluffy with the tartness of the berry sauces mixed with the vanilla formed the perfect combination of flavors. if you come here i recommend you try these. you will not be disappointed. the service was great and the food was even better. if you are in chicago this is the place to eat your breakfast."
754,Carmel T.,1127,4,4/4/18,"first let me say that we have attempted to try this place numerous times but failed. here, and the one in schaumburg! they were always super busy thus the wait was soooooooooper long. so, i embarked today for the millionth attempt. i was by my lone some self. the girl advised that it would be half an hour wait. huh! not bad at all! considering the past few times were like an hourtwo hour wait. we did not have patience back then. lol surprisingly, after waiting for only  mins, my table was ready. sahhhhhhhhweeeeeeet! my waitress was very pleasant and she was great. i looked at the menu, and i felt like ordering almost every single itemespecially the specialty pancakes section. noooooo, carmel, do not do it! so, i only ordered the classic eggs benedict and added spinach on it, with hash browns. i am a big fan of eggs benedicts . in almost all of the breakfast place i go to, that is what i order. eggs benedict . my order arrived shortly. it was muy bueno! yum yum yum, delicioso as dora would say. the hollandaise sauce was thick, creamy, a bit tart, and tasty. the eggs were poached well. runny. just how i like it. the hash brown was cooked well. it was not burnt or undercooked. you can actually see potatoes from the shavings. their prices were not bad also. considering it is in downtown chicago, where they charge you an arm and a leg for everything! so glad i stopped by here today. and yes, i will attempt to try them again! hopefully the next time, it will not be as long of a wait also! insert smiley face here the end."
755,Ishu J.,1127,5,3/15/18,"one of the best places to try breakfast items. we tried a lot of things including classic eggs benedict , veggie omelet, veggie burger and chicken panini wrap. in the dessert, their signature berry bliss pancake is the best. they serve fresh orange juice, which is amazing. also, i tried their strawberry vanilla smoothie which was so refreshing. overall, i loved everything there and i feel the initial wait of around hours is worth it."
756,Lily G.,1127,5,2/20/18,"amazing! suggestion especially on the weekends it is a good idea to arrive before am, otherwise be prepared for an  hr wait minimum. the location is fantastic as it is across millenium park so it is convenient if you are planning on scratching off cloud gate off your list. the food is excellent as well as the service. we were a group of  and everyone absolutely loved the food. everyone said the pancakes were amazing. we tried the butcher block skillet, denver skillet, fried chicken and waffles, classic eggs benedict , banana and chocolate chip pancakes, cinnamon pancakes, oreo s'mores pancakes and their regular pancakes all fantastic!"
757,Ms Vixen V.,1127,5,11/26/17,"there will be a wait no matter what time you go. so be ready for that. but the fact is, the food is well worth the wait! the classic eggs benedict is no joke the best benedict i have ever had. and i have had alot of benedicts as it is one of my favorite breakfast meals. ham off the bone, are you kidding me? and homemade hollandaise! absolutely delicious. i also love omelets and if you like a little spice, the espanola is your omelet to get. the veggie omelet with egg whites was also very good. tasted light and fluffy. the pancakes will make your mouth water just by looking at them. this caf is a must try if your in the area and want an amazing breakfast."
758,Ray J.,1127,5,7/13/17,i got their classic eggs benedict and it is arguably one of the best. their bone ham slices and hollandaise sauce are superb. great service!
759,Jenn B.,1127,5,6/12/17,"i do not give many  star reviews, but this place deserves it! my husband and i are visiting from boston, and were not quite sure if we should stay after seeing the long wait lines, but it is worth it! great selection with a ton of fun breakfast options. i got the classic eggs benedict which came with a good portion of hash browns and it was delightful. my hubby got a scramble with a side of pancakes, and it was equally as enjoyable. we will return on our next visit to chicago !"
760,Meli.Lars M.,1127,5,5/11/17,"delayed review  visited in january  we got this recommendation from a dear friend and it was extremely worth the wait! as soon as we got off of the plane on a spontaneous saturday morning, we knew we had to head straight there to put our names on the list. the time flew by waited ~ish minutes, mind you it was also during the time trump was inaugurated into officethe women's march and we got distracted by a bunch of cool things going on in the area so we did not mind the wait at all. we understand good food requires patience so we did not mind but others should be mindful that it is a wait for all of this deliciousness. it was nice that they had a texting system in place so we were able to run around taking selfies at the bean in millennium park while we waited. expect a wait of  mins minimum because they do not take reservations. it was just the two of us so bigger parties should expect a longer wait. we were looking forward to seeing what all of the hub bub was about and we went for a couple of legends on the menu berry bliss pancakes were huge, sweet, and extremely moist. more of waffle people but would  order this again because it hits the sweet tooth in all the right places. the mascarpone and anglaise ran down the center of the pancakes and made it perfection. the classic eggs benedict was a fulfilling dish. eggs poached perfectly and hollandaise sauce nicely done. the portions were generous for both dishes. the staff members were extremely friendly and attentive. do not think you can go wrong with any dish but these two were on our radars for a long time coming. long story short, so much great food per dish but not enough tummy room at the time. a must when in chicago and longing for midwesternhometownbrunch foods!"
761,Rita S.,1127,5,3/24/17,"everything about this place is  stars! the location, the hosters, the waiters, the food...! this is my nd time here. st time i had a chopped salad and it was super delicious, flavorful, big portion. also had a strawberry cheesecake french toast which was good but not extraordinary. nd time i had classic eggs benedict and by far was the best one i ever had! that thick juicy slice of ham omg unbeatable! had also chocolate banana bread french toast for dessert and those are to die for! cannot wait to come back specially now that is getting warm in chicago and we can get a table outside! there is only  downside about this place and it is because it is too good the waiting time ~h  but it is worth it!!"
762,Kate G.,1127,1,1/9/17,"i had been looking forward to this place for sometime. unfortunately it did not live up to its hype. i ordered classic eggs benedict with a side of pancakes, juice and coffee. first let me preface that i always order eggs benedict where ever i am. because i had to make it so many times when cooking i know what it is supposed to look and taste. this one did neither. if i wanted a half of a shank of ham i would have ordered one. eggs benedict is supposed to have shaved ham or canadian bacon. the hollandaise was also lacking in that it was cold and had no taste at all. the pancakes although tasted good were soggy and cold. again very disappointing. they really need a quality person running their line and controlling what comes out of the kitchen. doubt i will ever return but luckily chicago has a lot of other choices"
763,J K.,1127,5,9/11/16,"i have always tried to eat here whenever i was in chicago, and finally i have made it. the line is always super long, but it is worth it. we arrived at around am on a tuesday and there was a  minute wait. the wait actually went by pretty quickly as it seems like the workers there are really efficient. for example, as soon as we got to our table, there was water already set for us. and even when there were a lot of people waiting in line for a table, they never once rushed us to leave at all. i ordered the classic eggs benedict with fruit. their menu also had sandwiches too but we were there for the breakfast! i was able to finish my food, but the portion sizes are pretty big. depending on what you get, they are big enough to share. i suggest coming here right before it opens so there would be less of a wait "
764,Allie J.,1127,5,8/28/16,"oh my goodness, if i have to wait an hour i expect exceptional food and service. let me tell you that we ended up only waiting  minutes. and, i can not express to you how worth the wait this place was. we tried the classic eggs benedict , denver scramble, and the pancakes. the service was quick, all the items were delicious. i may even go back and wait another hour tomorrow for more hollandaise sauce. it is amazing. just amazing."
765,Ashley F.,1127,4,6/21/16,"was finally able to try this place third times the charm!. because we were a party of  we were seated almost immediately. because we were in a savory mood my friend and i had the classic eggs benedict ham off the bone on an english muffin with a poached egg and hashbrowns and i had the southern benedict oven baked biscuits, sausage patties, sausage gravy and hashbrowns. i also had the fresh squeezed oj and my friend has pineapple lemonade which she reported was a bit too sweet. our meals were super tasty and came in huge portions and our server was kind and attentive which is impressive in such a busy place. while it does not have much in the way of ambiance the food is good and worth the wait."
766,Sam M.,1127,5,6/6/16,"we loved breakfast here. we ordered classic eggs benedict , pancakes, denver omelette. coffee was delicious. service was outstanding. we did not have to wait long at all so maybe we were lucky based on some of the other reviews. if you like breakfast food you will love this place."
767,Marta V.,1127,4,3/4/16,"i have been to this spot for breakfast and brunch many times and always loved it. their classic eggs benedict are fantastic, but if you are feeling like eating healthy i suggest the fresca omelette with tomatoes and avocado. for those more into sweet breakfast, i think no one will argue the best are the signature berry pancakes. they do not take reservations and it is usually pretty crowded in the weekends, so either get there early or be ready to wait. but be patient, this place is worth it!"
768,Iane S.,1127,2,2/29/16,the homemade corned beef hash was unappetizing and gave me a really bad case of food poisoning.  hours later and i am still trying to recover from it. my boyfriend got the classic eggs benedict and it was nothing special. i would stick with the sweet breakfast options as the berry pancakes were tasty.
769,Jia F.,1127,5,1/23/16,"a great place for brunch! we shared classic eggs benedict and butcher block skillet. both tasted good! the pancakes came with skillet were soft and delicious, not too sweet. eggs were perfectly cooked, and the hash browns were crunchy and tasty. the waiters were nice and friendly. and the location was pretty good, right across the street of millennium park. the only notsogood thing about this place was the long wait, we had to wait about  mins, but it was well worth it!"
770,Lynn N.,1127,5,9/5/15,"there is always a long wait!! go early to put down your name at least  hour in advance. i ordered the classic eggs benedict and my boyfriend order the berry waffles! they are both deliciously satisfying. throw in an extra side of apple smokedwood bacon and you are in heaven! if this is your first time, go for the pancakes!! it is a must and it is what they are known for. if you are going with a friend or two, on have everyone order something different so you can try everything!"
771,Avery R.,1127,4,8/16/15,"wait times can be very long in the morning. we put our name on the list and took a walk in millennium park which is right across randolph st. our wait was quoted as  minutes so we came back after about  minutes and were seated just after an hour. the food was good, in our group we tried the pancakes, the crepes and the classic eggs benedict . eggs benedict had a very thick tasty cut of ham. once seated service was fast and food came out promptly. this is a very good place for breakfast but the long wait time we experienced i think is related to the premium location and the peak time that we got there."
772,Philip V.,1127,4,6/25/15,"voted as having the best pancakes in all of chicago, i knew wildberry pancakes and cafe had to be first on my list of brunch options. the food signature berry bliss pancakes . this is one of those dishes that look and sound better than it actually tasted. consisting of  average sized, fluffy pancakes, it is topped with blackberry coulis, berry mascarpone, vanilla anglaise, powdered sugar, and fresh berries. the visual appeal is enough to give you that wow factor, but unfortunately the taste wavered from being too sweet or too sour. by no means was it horrible, it just lacked a comforting, culinary medium that i seek in pancakes. classic eggs benedict . i am a sucker for this dish anywhere, anytime. here at wildberry, they did a terrific job with it. it comes with poached egg , ham off the bone, toasted egg muffin, and homemade hollandaise sauce. i love the width and flavor of the ham and the hollandaise sauce has a sweet taste with a pleasant, thick consistency. butcher block sizzlin' skillet . a fitting name for all the dreamy components that is contained in this dish! it is a meat lover's dream. it comes with  scrambled eggs , ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage, bacon, cheddar jack cheese, and hash browns! as delectably wonderful as this dish sounds, i felt it lacked a punch of salt as the hash browns and eggs were a little bland. maybe, wildberry was depending on the cured meats to compensate, but if that is the case, it did not fulfill the job well. corned beef hash . love the texture as it was not mushy like most places, but could use more seasoningsalt.  conclusion based on the high reviews, i guess it is fair to say my time at wildberry fell short of expectations, but i still enjoyed it...even with the one hour waittime! wild berry's extensive and creative brunch menu is deserving of praise and a visit when you are in town. a convenient spot since it is next to millennium park where you can check out cloud gate while you wait for your table. extra notes accepts credit card wait times can be a painranging from min. hours. come early! decor is modernly elegant and atmosphere is bright and inviting service is friendly, but could be more attentive restrooms are clean"
773,Julie M.,1127,4,9/9/18,"put your name on the waiting list online through yelp! you will save yourself a long wait at the restaurant. when we arrived, they were ready for us. we had two little ones with us and they had a spot outside the restaurant for strollers to save on space. the only thing that was frustrating is we needed to open the wing on our table about  inches for the high chair and it became a huge ordeal. the table nor chairs were going to be in anyone's way but the busboy had to get the waiter who had to get the manager who in turn just said, no problem. other than that, the food was great. i ordered the corned beef and hash skillet . it was the perfect hangover or lazy sunday morning meal. it lasted me until dinner. after breakfast we enjoyed the walk to the water, while our food settled."
774,Marah R.,1127,4,9/4/18,"had brunch here! start of with freshly squeezed orange juice. must try the skillets . it is a big one so one can share. i had corned beef and hash with over easy egg on top. choice of toast or pancake with it. we had to wait  mins for we are a big group. i was also able to check wait times on the yelp app which was very useful. overall, cannot go wrong here. next to macy's so did shopping after."
775,Kristen K.,1127,5,5/4/18,"we arrived just after it opened  am on a thursday and were seated immediately. the fresh squeezed orange juice was thirst quenching first thing in the morning after walking  blocks. we ordered the corned beef and hash skillet with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes, the signature berry bliss crepes, and chicken and waffles. our goal was to get a little taste of everything. it was everything you would want in breakfast savory, hearty, mouthwatering. i will go back if i am in the area again. it had a wait time by the time we walked out at  am."
776,Blake K.,1127,4,8/10/16,"my mom and i decided to choose this place once we landed down in chicago for a weeks vacation. since it was around pm we did not know if we wanted breakfast or lunch, so wildberry sounded just about right. it was quite the wait, but we knew there probably would not be a better place around for a bite to eat so we decided to wait the min. we looked over the menu and quickly placed our order because we were starving! i ordered a strawberry mango smoothie, and although it was pretty good it tasted more like a virgin daqueri than an actual smoothie. as for our entrees, the important part, i ordered corned beef and hash with two poached eggs and my mom ordered a vegetable omelete. the corn beef was decent and the eggs were cooked perfectly. the vegetable omelete was loaded with veggies, and i liked how they added in many various vegetables you would not normally find in an omelete. all in all, it was a good experience. we did not have the best waitress, but i would definitely come back for a well cooked breakfast."
777,Gavrilo I.,1127,5,7/1/16,"thank you yelp for showing me this great breakfast spot. the wait time was not bad at all, only  min and the services was just as fast! i tried their corned beef and hash and it tasty. you can tell its fresh has towns always a plus and fresh corned beef . the eggs cooked perfectly and the server kept the coffee refills on point. great environment and friendly staff as well."
778,Clayton L.,1127,3,10/19/15,"i think that this was a case of the juice not being worth the squeeze, especially since on saturday we tried and it had a two hour wait. had we waited then to eat, and gotten the same meal...i may have even gone  stars. now here is the deal, the pancakes are fluffy, they make a good pancake. but the signature berry and the cinnamon roll pancakes were comparable to ihop. maybe i hop stole their idea, but there was nothing great about it. the home made corned beef and hash tasted like it came from a can, and as it was raved about as well i just could not put it all together...until i got the bill. it makes since. the portions were huge, and the price was low, and when people are on vacation that can get great reviews. but i think that is where the reviews come from. large portions, low prices, but the actual quality of food was sub par."
779,Chris W.,1127,5,10/9/13,"the food was amazing. i had the corned beef and hash skillet with cinnamon bun french toast. the corned beef was not from the can, i could tell it was hand prepared. the cinnamon bun french toast was awesome. it was so much food we almost could not finish it all, but it was so good we continued eating."
780,Kate K.,1127,4,3/5/13,"while doing research for activities to do on our short trip to chicago i saw wildberry cafe recommended on a few websites and the yelp rating was pretty good so we decided to give it a try. so glad we did because brunch was delicious! the duck confit hash special was quite tasty. corned beef and hash was really good too. it comes with either fruit or hash browns, and either pancakes or toast. the best thing out of our meal hands down was the signature berry bliss pancakes buttery pancakes stuffed with fresh maine blueberries & layered with wildberry mascarpone. topped with fresh blackberries, strawberries, vanilla cream anglaise and a fresh blackberry coulis. it was not overly sweet despite a dusting of sugar on top. i am generally not a pancakes lover but this place makes the list of top  pancake places ever for me next to harry's roadhouse in nm and clinton street bakery in ny. tips  these are definitely huge american sized portions at wildberry so come hungry or be prepared to doggie bag.  they won best pancake in chicago do not remember the details but it was advertised on the back of one of their menus so if you are having a hard time deciding, definitely go for the pancakes.  go for the  upgrade to special pancakes with your meal. one of the best upgrade decisions you will ever make  promise! i tried yolk the day right after and definitely prefer wildberry. so if you are here for a short weekend trip like i was and are trying to decide between the two yolk was nothing special but i left wildberry and made a mental note to myself that i had to return the next time i am in town if just to try the tiramisu and oreo s'mores pancakes. wish i could bring this place back with me to ny."
781,Josh S.,1127,5,10/20/18,"they do not take reservations but we added our name to the bottom of the list, number  in order, and we went for a walk around millennium park. we came back  min later and was immediately given a table on the patio. there were still  people listed ahead of us but because we were willing to sit on the patio it sped things up. food was nothing short of the best breakfast i have ever had. i ordered the butcher block skillet with a apple pecan pancake. delicious. i do not care what the wait is it is worth it."
782,Marcie D.,1127,5,10/14/18,"amazing! best meal i have had in chicago. there were two of us and we got the butcher block skillet with berry bliss pancakes and a side order of toast. plenty for us to split and we are not little eaters! all of it was great and had great service. we got there before am and only had about a  minute wait but as we were leaving around am the wait was already an hour. so, i suggest waking up early for this one. you will not regret it."
783,Charles G.,1127,3,10/12/18,"the place is packed. my best parents arrived a few minutes before us and they do not seat until the whole party arrives. we got there and my wife was outside on a work call. they sat us counted and said we needed to wait up front till the whole party arrives. we tried explaining that she was coming but no. my wife came in . minutes later and they took us to the same table. my dad is a diabetic so he gets hangry until he gets breakfast so it was getting stressful. after being sat it took a little while to get service. my food was pretty good actually i had the butcher block skillet and cinnamon roll pancakes. it just took a while. my wife's omelette was not like an omelette, it was more of a scramble with old veg. the server was attentive and helpful. overall from the seating it kind of upset me. i will probably not return."
784,Hong N.,1127,3,8/26/18,this place has really good pancakes! it was very light and fluffy. the other brunch items were alright. we ordered the florence benedict and the butcher block skillet but nothing stood out. waited for about an hour so we walked around millennium park.
785,Henry W.,1127,5,8/25/18,"oh my god..i cannot remember the last time i had such an amazing brunch. wildberry literally had me dumbfounded by how good it was. ~ mexicana hash browns, two eggs, cheddar & jack cheese, chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro & onions. this skillet was incredible..perfectly crisp hash browns, melted cheese mixed with hearty chorizo topped with roasted jalapenos for a nice kick. if you are looking for something with a slight kick in spice, i would recommend this one! ~ butcher block  hash browns, two eggs, cheddar & jack cheese, ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage & bacon. if you have ever watched parks & rec, this is literally a breakfast that ron swanson would be pleased to eat it is a meat lovers galore. ~ signature berry bliss pancakes soft & fluffy pancakes topped with some beautiful berry concoction. this was sweet & delicious. i was honestly kinda sad when i had my last bite because this was so good.. pls just come here to eat."
786,Emily C.,1127,5,8/9/18,"this place makes amazing waffles! the berry bliss belgian waffles are a musttry if you cannot decide. i have had the same flavor in pancakes and waffles, and for me the waffles triumphed. their sizzling skillets are great. my boyfriend and i really enjoyed the butcher block . it is definitely big enough to share between two people, especially if you want only a taste of sausage, bacon, and other meats. there is no wait if you come at  or  on a weekday. i know it gets really busy around noon."
787,Benjamin R.,1127,4,8/7/18,seated in the outdoor section upon request. water was immediately brought to my table. waiter was very friendly and clarified some menu items for me. i ordered the butcher block skillet and blueberry pancakes. the food was brought out quickly. it was good. not great but good. the overall service was excellent. not a bad spot for a quick breakfast.
788,Kristen H.,1127,4,6/12/18,"we made a reservation on yelp before heading there because we heard the wait was a while without reservation. when we got there, their line was out the door, but since we had reservation, we only waited about  mins before getting seated. we took a look at the menu and quickly picked what we want to eat. we ordered the southern benedict and the butcher block . they were both pretty good. i really liked the gravy they used, really good with my muffin. their hash brown was also really crispy, which was a plus. we were both really full but still decided to try the berry bliss pancakes. omg they were so good, supper fluffy and soft. and surprisingly they were not too sweet. we could not finish a good amount of our food so we got it to go. they package it for you really nicely too! will definitely recommend and come back if i am ever in the area again."
789,Vanessa T.,1127,5,6/8/18,"came here for brunch on sunday and it was very busy. there were people waiting outside and inside. there is an upper level with seating but even then, it was still very busy. we were finally seated and were handed the menus. i ordered the los altos benedict which had chorizo sausages, red peppers, poached eggs, and hash browns. it was very savory with a hint of mexican burrito taste. i loved it! it was also quite spicy, so if you cannot handle spicy, i would not recommend getting it. my bf got the butcher block skillet which had hash browns, cheese, eggs, sausage, and bacon. he also got a side of the specialty berry bliss specialty pancakes. the food was so good, i was very pleased with the generous portions and the quality of the taste. of course, we had leftovers since we ordered too much food. we also got the wildberry orange juice which was super tasty! it had a touch of berry and orange taste to it. the blend was very smooth and refreshing. i just wished they had the ac on that day. it was very hot outside and humid and the inside was very stuffy! everyone was eating with sweat dripping down. i would have liked to enjoyed my meal more."
790,Brandon B.,1127,5,6/8/18,"breakfast taken to another level! wildberry is located in a perfect spot right next to millennium park so you can walk around when you wait. you will be waiting because this place is always busy and for good reason, they make really good food. obviously, go there for the pancakes. the pancakes i recommend are the oreo s'mores pancakes. these pancakes were light, fluffy, then you get hit with the marshmallow flavor, then the crunch from the oreo, and then the chocolate hits you on the back end. this was out of bounds good. the second thing i recommend chocolate banana bread french toast. this french toast is packed with flavor. you get a huge hit of the banana flavor mixed with the chocolate which pairs nicely. when you look at this dish you are kinda bummed there is not more, but these french toast slices are super dense and they will fill you up. now, if you are starving and you want a hearty meal go for the butcher block skillet. the butcher block has hashbrowns, cheddar and jack cheese,  eggs, ham, sausage, turkey and chicken sausage, and topped off with bacon. a meat lovers wet dream. haha. this is definitely a must eat in chicago and i can see why this is the number  breakfast place in chi town. brandonfitfoodie"
791,Melissa S.,1127,5,6/3/18,"this place is definitely worth the wait! lines can get long, so get in line on yelp before coming. one of my favorite brunch places in chicago. they have both normal and really elevated breakfast and lunch dishes. on this visit, i got the fresca omelette, which was sun dried tomato, basil, avocado and cheese. it was super good! i love that you can get fruit or hash browns. husband got the butcher block skillet and loved every bite.  the berry bliss pancakes are a must order if you like berries, or if you want something really indulgent, the chocolate banana bread french toast rocked my world!"
792,Lana N.,1127,5,6/2/18,"at first glance of wildberry pancakes and cafe pictures on yelp, this honestly looked like any other breakfastbrunch spot. when skimming through the yelp reviews, i was shocked to see so many familiar faces that rated this place with high ratings. i trusted your reviews and decided to give this place a try and i am so glad i did! this is definitely the one spot that i would have to visit again the next time i am in chicago! the wait was not bad at all  considering the fact that they have the wait list available on yelp. we placed down our names and walked there from our hotel and waited just a few minutes before we got seated. the service here is amazing. waitress and staff was very attentive, helpful, friendly, and quick! the food was unbelievably good! we ordered a few entrees to share and try and i would highly recommend them all  florence benedict  amazing! so rich is flavor and the bacon bits was a steal of the show!  butcher block  meat lovers unite! this was really good and probably was one of my top favorite things here!  honey toffee nut latte  just shut up and try it.  signature berry pancakes  i would not even consider this pancakes. the texture was so different and light. it was a recommendation as a must try for me and i would say the same.  banana bread french bread  this tasted exactly like a banana bread. it was not bad at all! it was amazing but really filling and rich. i would not recommend this is you are having other sweets such as pancakes because it might be too heavy. the other best thing about this place is that it is literally right across the street from the bean. hit two best places in chicago at once!"
793,Scot N.,1127,5,5/31/18,"wow. wow. have i said wow? it has been a couple of weeks since our brunch here, and i am still thinking about how amazing the food was. the service was very attentive without being overbearing. the food menu was slightly overwhelming due to its sheer length but that is a good thing as there is something on the menu for everyone. i will say that if you are looking for a quiet place to have brunch, this is not it. this is a very busy, somewhat cramped restaurant which may feel claustrophobic to some. if there was one complaint, it is that there is no covered space outside for people to wait in order to get a table. when it is raining or snowing, that really sucks. we were thankfully able to put our name on the waitlist before we left the hotel, but even after showing up and hour later, we still needed to wait outside in the rain for at least  minutes. but, you come here for the food and that does not disappoint. i had the butcher block skillet which had ample meat and even more flavor. my only regret is that i did not get another waffle to go with it because those waffles were some of the best i have ever had. seriously, if you are in chicago and looking for someplace to have breakfast or brunch, get your name on the waitlist and show up with a hearty appetite. you will not be disappointed."
794,Tiffany H.,1127,5,5/8/18,"i am sooooooo glad i got to eat here before i left chicago. i came for a mini vacation and wanted to eat here from day one but, the wait was always long. i walked from my hotel here on my last day exploring and thank goodness the wait was only  minutes. i used the yelp app to put my name down, table for one please!!! it still took about  minutes before i actually got seated but, since i got to put my name down on yelp i was still walking to wildberry. came checked in with the host and was seated in about  minutes!!! the place was crowded for a monday morning! along with the food and great service i can see why this place always has a significant wait! worth it! as i sat down my server told me she would be right with me. no problem!!! i was debating between an omelette or a skillet and asked her for her opinion. she told me definitely get the skillet.. i got the butcher block skillet and it was meaty just the way i like it! i drenched it with my usual condiment..tabasco and pepper and my mouth was livin!!! i love this breakfast place! cannot wait to visit chicago again so i can eat here!!!"
795,Rohan P.,1127,4,4/13/18,"amazing food and coffee. service tries their best. do not go on the weekend during peek hours if you want to avoid long waits. their menu is typical brunch style with good pancake medleys, french toast, skillets, and omelets. dishes i typically order butcher block skillet, sweet potato fries, berry bliss pancakes."
796,Jenilee C.,1127,5,4/3/18,"was recommended this place while visiting chicago and met a friend who lived in town. this place is nuts on a saturday morning but you can alleviate this by doing online checkin. we got seated and our server was there in a flash. she was friendly and able to offer great recommendations to us. we shared three different specialty pancakes between our table and were not disappointed! we did the cinnamon roll which was the favorite and the berry bliss and another that had lemon drizzle on it. i had the butcher block skillet  it was delicious with the eggs sunny side up! it was very filling as well, if the pancakes did not look so enticing then that would have been plenty! i think the prices are reasonable as well for the value. i would definitely return here when visiting chicago again, despite the crowd. the service is very professional and they know how to move people through without rushing you."
797,Huong L.,1127,3,2/24/18,"i really do not know what the hype of this place is but i thought it was normal. the wait was ridiculous but i am glad that yelp have the wait list system so you do not have to be physically there waiting. i was on the wait list for roughly . hours before coming to the restaurant itself, then had to wait another  minutes before i got seats. this place is packed!!!!!! i got the butcher block skillet with no cheese, sunny side eggs, and toast. the skillet was big, enough to feed two people! the flavors were good and everything went well together. the thing that threw me off was that i was expecting things to be crispy because it is in a skillet, but i am pretty sure they just cooked everything and threw it in a metal container. the best thing there was the rye bread. it has an earthy flavor and a good crunch. i am really glad i did not get cheese because i feel that the cheese will make the dish really heavy and more soggy. service was mixed to me, i feel taht they were nice and attentive but overdid it somewhat. our server gave us the check when we were only halfway done. another server came and almost took one of the plates that we were still working on. i know that it is busy and they are trying to be efficient, but it is a little rude in my opinion. overall, it is a good breakfast joint, but a  hour wait good? i do not think so."
798,Edward B.,1127,5,2/23/18,"excellent food, great service....worth the wait. everything on the menu looked great. got the butcher block skillet was amazing."
799,Jack W.,1127,5,9/9/17,"thursday am reserve on yelp ahead of time to hold your spot in line. seated almost right away mexicana sizzlin' skillet . comes with side of pancakes or toast get the pancakes! perfect if you are looking for something with a kick. hot sauce is provided but the chorizo is a great natural spice. portion is substantial even without the pancakes on the side. corned beef benny   comes with side of toast or pancakes as well not shown on menu. the hollandaise sauce is amazing! could use some sides to make the plate look less empty but portion is still good. the english muffin was a bit too toasted making it hard to cut through. signature berry bliss pancakes  some of the fluffiest, best tasting pancakes i have had i have had a lot. the fruits and the drizzle completes it, and the berries inside the pancake is the icing on the cake. highly recommended! no syrup needed. oreo s'more pancakes . equally as fluffy as the signature berry bliss pancakes, but the amount of chocolate and sweetness on this is overwhelming. if you think you have a sweet tooth, you will not anymore after this dish. there is oreo and chocolate over and inside the pancakes. complete with melted marshmallow on top. needless to say, no additional syrup needed as well."
800,Cbabyand F.,1127,5,9/7/17,"holy smokes! the whole team was here for this one. all the flapjacks and colorful drinks made it look like everyone was sitting at turntables. i had the corned beef benny and, let me tell ya, it was the best benny i have seen since the jet rodriguez. the food was so good that it even got me a break from c baby's side stories for a time. other than the fact that a lot of the eggs were killed out of season poached, i really enjoyed my time here. strong, strong rec from the team."
801,Mark R.,1127,4,2/24/17,the corned beef benny was outstanding. ask for their fresh made sals and you will be glad. the specialty pancakes were good as well. expect to pay  per person.
802,Trent L.,1127,5,2/15/17,"came here for saturday morning brunch! this place is super popular and the wait is like  hours. however, they came up with a perfect remedy to the problem! you can make reservations on yelp and they will text you when your table is ready! i made reservations and we just walked down to millennium park and hung out. so convenient! i had the mexicana skillet and my gf had the corned beef benny . i chose to upgrade my pancakes and got the berry bliss pancakes well worth the upgrade!. the skillet was amazing! the portion was very large. the eggs were nice and runny and you could really taste the delicious chorizo. the avocado gave the dish a nice creamy flavor and the salsa added a nice kick to it. the jalapeos were present with another kick but did not overpower the dish a common problem with jalapeos. best skillet i have ever had. it was a little greasy but not too bad for a skillet. the corned beef benny was good. the english muffin was nice and fluffy but i wish i had tasted more corned beef . the berry bliss pancakes were heavenly! there was some nice fresh berries on the side. the craime anglaise was deliciously sweet with a nice vanilla flavor. the berry mascarpone sauce between the pancakes was rich and warm and made the pancakes even better. probably the best pancakes i have ever had! overall wildberry has found an ingenious way to cope with long lines while keeping customers happy. i had no problem with waiting because of how convenient it was. the service was fantastic and the food was amazing! will definitely be coming back when i am back in the windy city."
803,Michelline Y.,1127,4,1/1/17,"okay this will be my first review lol. but i have been dying to go this place and if you want to make it worth it, download the no wait app so that you do not have to wait hours and plan ahead. the signature pancakes were on point. i have a sweet tooth so it was memorizing. the corn beef benny is quite creative in my opinion. idk bout you the filipino blood in me loves corn beef and i love eggs benedict so it was a good combo! needed some garlic, though. overall, good place to eat brunch and etc."
804,Kayla S.,1127,5,12/30/16,use the nowait app!! we waited  minutes while others were given an estimated wait time of an hour and forth five minutes. our food came quickly and our server mike d. was great. highly recommend the kiwi lemonade and the corn beef benny . my friend said it was the best breakfast she is ever had!!
805,Ashley H.,1127,4,10/15/16,"worth the wait! plan ahead and walk around millenium park while you wait. the signature wildberry pancakes are a must have. i had them as my side and i wish it had been my entree. i also had the corned beef benny  chipotle hollandaise was crazy tasty but the hash was meh. great food, atmosphere, and service our waitress was the sweetest!"
806,David M.,1127,5,7/6/16,"this is so much more than a breakfast place. while they have breakfast items on the menu, it is so over the top, you have to eat it to believe it. we got there about am and had a short wait. the place is big and the service is very good, but it is so popular you should plan on a wait. i got the corned beef benny and my wife got the pancakes lemon custard. omg! they were both so good and were very large portions. while i was able to somehow finish mine, my wife took more than half of hers back to the hotel. this is not an everyday breakfast stop, but for a special treat, you will be so happy you came to wildberries!"
807,Kristen Q.,1127,5,6/11/16,"loved this place and the corned beef benny served w eggs benedict. the largest portions, friendliest service, and my fave brunch spot i will return to next time 'fo sure! also i am gluten free so our waitress kindly substituted out the gluten items for fruit instead. thank you waitress for being so kind and making our first full day in chicago lovely! what made it very enjoyable was downloading the no wait app and not waiting more than minutes. all restaurants should use technology to make seating more efficient at hot spots w hour waits which could be cut in half if they were to incorporate apps to help with such issues. thank you wildberry!!!"
808,Laurel P.,1127,5,4/15/16,one of my favorite breakfast places! came to chicago all the way from cleveland and this was my first stop. corned beef benny is amazing!
809,Veronica P.,1127,4,3/22/16,"wildberry pancakes and caf has  locations in the chicago area. obviously they specialize in breakfast, and pancakes in particular. the corned beef benny . is a take on an eggs benedict. the corned beef hash is house made. while good, i would have preferred the corned beef hash to be a little crisper. the eggs were poached well, with a nice runny yolk. a chipotle hollandaise finished the dish, but was lacking in any spice. the crme brulee french toast was a thick slice of bread drizzled with a vanilla crme anglaise. i prefer my french toast super soggy, and this one did not fit the bill. i have found that most restaurants will not make french toast super soggy since it takes extra time for the longer soak. i understand that the kitchen needs to turn over food as quickly as possible, but accommodating the probably infrequent request does not seem like a huge ordeal. the red velvet french toast . was a nice, thick slice of red velvet cake with an insane amount of cream cheese stuffed inside. once again topped with a vanilla crme anglaise, this was a sure winner. the banana cream pie pancakes . were two large pancakes topped with freshly sliced bananas smothered in a mountain of whipped cream. the pancakes were light, but somewhat dense at the same time if that makes any sense. crumbled brown sugar added a slight textural contrast. the chocolate chip pancakes . were drizzled in chocolate syrup. chocolate chips were imbedded in the pancakes. these were okay and nothing special. one of the specials was duck hash, which contained a very generous portion of large pieces of duck intermingled with hash browns. it was topped by  eggs. this was a very good dish. although wildberry specializes in pancakes, i found that they missed the mark on that end. the red velvet french toast and duck hash were the clear winners."
810,Kayle E.,1127,5,1/2/16,"this was our first breakfast in chicago and oh my gosh, it was my absolute favorite. first of all, expect to wait, so download the nowait app, get in line on it, and go check out the bean and chicago cultural center while you wait. the service was awesome! jeremy was great and so animated and perky  he was the best server we had all trip! i got the corned beef benny with a cinnamon roll pancake... you can get their signature pancakes as a side! love! my hubby got the butcher skillet with a caramel apple pecan pancake his pancake was not nearly as delicious as mine! definitely a must for anyone visiting chicago!"
811,Tiffanie L.,1127,5,12/22/15,"happy i had a chance to dine here while visiting chicago. my friend and i decided to dine on a weekday to avoid the long, long, long wait on the weekends and luckily, we only waited about  mins. we definitely came here with a big appetite..... maybe a little too big because our eyes were more hungry than our stomachs! of course, we ordered the signature berry bliss pancakes, corned beef benny and mexicana skillet......... brb, i am in heaven! the berry bliss pancakes had the perfect amount of sweetness. from the benedict to the skillet, both were savory and delicious. the portions are decent and we had plenty of food left. cannot wait to come back ="
812,Enzo W.,1127,5,10/27/15,"i have been here twice for outoftown guests and it is definitely worth the wait. i tried the berry bliss, red velvet french toast, corn beef benny , and one of the skillets. all were tremendous."
813,Kathy H.,1127,5,10/3/15,"this place is worth the hour wait! compliments to the hosts and servers for keeping their calm and positive attitude with all the diners they deal with! had the cheese omelet  perfectly cooked, corned beef benny was delish, shared the wildberry pancakes....heavenly! ryan l., our wildberry tour guideserver, was super nice, funny and totally made our visit!"
814,Henry B.,1127,5,9/27/15,"wow! i am not a breakfast person but this place was incredible. it was extremely busy and for great reason. we had the wildberry crepes and the corned beef benny and both were outstanding. out waitress was also very friendly and took great care of us, i think her name was esmerelda? anyways, i cannot recommend this place enough. i wish i lived nearby so i could systematically try the entire menu. if you have read this far, set your alarm early and go there tomorrow morning. if you just woke up, get out of bed and get going! do not even brush your teeth, just go!"
815,Cathy And Lester F.,1127,5,8/9/15,extremely attentive service. generous portions. everything was very tasty!! we got the corned beef benny and the brisket hash. both were fantastic. the waitress suggested the pancake to be multigrain with blueberry no glaze. she was right on point and we fully enjoyed our pancakes! coffee and lattes are great. we would change nothing about the experience!
816,Bridget W.,1127,5,3/15/15,"this is probably the best breakfast i have ever had. i dream about coming back to eat here again. we came here while visiting chicago from out of state. food my husband and i both ordered benedicts. he got the southern benedict, and i got the corned beef benny . they were both huge portions and so rich. we did not come close to finishing. we also had to order the signature wildberry pancake just to try. so spectacular. had so much food leftover. service great service! i think we were almost immediately seated on a tuesday morning. environment such a bright happy place of delicious food. if you are ever in the area, make time to visit. so worth the hype!"
817,Kim A.,1127,5,3/3/15,"i do not leave reviews, but felt the need to start now thanks to wildberry! i visited chicago a few wks ago when the weather hit . i am from the bay area, so you can imagine just how cold i felt walking from the nearest parking garage to this cafe. i wondered if it would all be worth it.. and to my surprise, it was. i am usually a savorydish type of person when it comes to breakfast, but after reading the reviews, i knew i had to try the signature berry bliss pancakes. it was the best. tasting. pancakes. ever! vanilla anglaise, blackberry coulis, berry mascapone & fresh berries... you cannot go wrong. stacks of fluffy.. warm.. pancakes. just the right amount of sweetness... it was perfect. along with the pancakes, i also ordered the vanilla berry latte with sugar free syrup. it was amazing! we also got the corned beef benny , which was just alright imo. the menu said the benedict would come with chipotle hollandaise sauce, so i thought it would have great flavor.. but it was soso. if you are in the area, this place is a must! unlike other reviews, we got seated right away, but that is because we flew in early and got to the place around  am on a weekday and because i assume everyone likes to stay warm at home.. lol"
818,Andrew W.,1127,3,10/20/14,"this place is super popular. it is pretty good but not fantastic. some significant misses. i waited  minutes for a table. i would have waited longer but they did not bother to tell those of us waiting in line that you have to go inside give your name and get a pager. i was starving so i stayed. the ones that had been waiting in the cold and rain for longer got pissed and left. that is bad management, this cannot have been the first time this happened there ought to be a sign. i got the corned beef benny eggs benedict with corned beef hash, and chipotle hollandaise. the eggs were poached perfectly and beautifully. the hollandaise was really impressive so many places with this kind of customer volume make it from a tasteless mix and you can tell. this was rich and tasty. the corned beef was a little wet. i prefer my corned beef hash to be browned on the grill till crispy on the outside, this was not really. the hashed browns which came on the side were perfect okay, where ever there are biscuits and gravy, i am going to try them. i got a single biscuit and gravy and was really disappoined. you can get better biscuits frozen from pillsbury. it was not raised enough and was crumbly and nearly room temperature. the gravy had a really strange taste that i cannot really place. i have a pretty good sense of herbs and spices and i cannot tell what this was. it might have been a unique sausage, but the gravy had a sweet hint to it and is out of place in a sausage gravy. i did not try the pancakes but they looked good. not uniformly great, but i can say i had a good breakfast."
819,Anuj S.,1127,5,10/15/18,"i am looking at my review from a long time ago and to be honest at this point, if wildberry is not topshelf in the brunchspace, then i do not know who else is. i have tried and tried countless brunch places over the past few years, and nothing quite measures up. i mean, i do not think they have the best waffles or the best veggie burger, but somehow when you look at it as a package, they are just the best. even after trying so many options around chicago, the family always ends up preferring wildberry. bigtime props to them. i have just one suggestion for them  can you please open up a location in the west loop? that would make this a nocompetition choice for us every time."
820,Grant B.,1127,5,10/14/18,"fantastic  great food, great service. definite must try when in the chicago area. food order veggie omelet with cheddar cheese and no mushrooms, the mexicana hash with scrambled eggs, no meat, and a side of cinnamon roll pancakes. environment typical cafe setup with a lot of people waiting to get seated. they have some outdoor seats as well. verdict the mexicana was absolutely fantastic. great flavors, perfectly cooked and had all the aspects of a breakfast that we wanted eggs, hash browns, veggies , cheese, etc. customer service was phenomenal and their suggestions were on point. reservations you can reserve a spot on the yelp app. it was pretty amazing and an accurate estimate for the wait time. we had a minute wait and were able to explore the park and come back  minutes prior to our estimate and were seated rather quickly. tips reserve space with the yelp app and just relax until your time! next time would try their top rated waffle and berries pancakes."
821,Nicole M.,1127,5,10/9/18,delicious! huge omelette and my husband loved his burger! super sweet server. looking forward to coming back. get the veggie omelet and add cheese! yum
822,Kortney S.,1127,4,9/7/18,"i walked here from my hotel for a nice mid morning breakfast. i checked in via yelp to wait in line while we walked there. when we arrived there we were seated promptly and i am glad because this place is busy. and for good reason. the food is delicious. i ordered the veggie omelette with fruit and pancakes and my mom got the garden skillet with blueberry danish pancake. the portions are huge. you will feel fed. you are essentially eating breakfast and lunch. my favorite part was the pancakes. they were light and airy and melted in your mouth. our server was great, the food came out pretty quickly. it was a great experience."
823,Michelle C.,1127,5,8/14/18,"i loved everything about this place. the service was great! the waitlist on yelp worked out well and we only waited  min once we got there. i ordered the veggie hash and vanilla berry latte with almond milk. both were delicious! the vegan patty was so tasty! but definitely put your name on the waitlist through yelp, so you are not waiting outside for . hrs."
824,Kelly D.,1127,5,8/8/18,"absolutely love this place! we have never been disappointed! every employee is happy, friendly and they all work together well! you cannot go wrong with anything you order but the blueberry danish crepes are to die for...my favorite breakfast is the veggie omelet! i wish i could bring this place home."
825,Laura L.,1127,3,8/7/18,"i thought this place was slightly underwhelming, especially with all of the hype that surrounds this place. my fiance and i decided to give this place a shot, and we must have come in with really high expectations because we did not feel wowed. thankfully, we did not wait for more than  minutes otherwise, i feel like it would have been even more disappointing. i had the mushroom omelette with a side of berry pancakes, and my fiance had the veggie skillet with a side of cinnamon pancakes. both of our dishes were absolutely overwhelmed with cheese, and although the cheese was delicious, it became disgusting after a few bites. my fiance and i both had to cover our dishes with tabasco and add salt and pepper to give it some taste. the cinnamon pancakes were covered in the sweet syrupicing on top, and it really ruined the pancakes overall way way too sweet until we wiped it all off. my berry pancakes were perfect though  they were super fluffy with a little sweetness to them that negated the need for any syrup. it is rather unfortunate that my fiance and i were so extremely underwhelmed by this brunch location. maybe one day we will give it another shot."
826,Radha O.,1127,2,7/20/18,"i have been to wildberry on numerous occasions and am a little shocked with this visit. i decided to try an all vegan option for breakfast. it had tomatoes, veggies , and a veggie patty on top. i asked for a slice of cheese because it is me and cheese is my life. the seller was the avocado on top. however, i was disappointed with how flavorless the whole dish was. veganvegetarian options do not have to be bland which is something wildberry can improve on. i could have chosen a sweet dish or a scrambler, but i decided to venture out and unfortunately was not happy. hopefully they will improve the dish or create more tasteful options for those that are vegan."
827,Christin S.,1127,5,7/15/18,"just had the most amazing brunch here. the wait was about an hour, but with millennium park right across the street, it is really easy to walk around and pass the time. i got some hot green tea with lemon which was really nice. then i had the garden skillet which has a ton of veggies , hash browns, cheese, and two eggs over easy. it was delicious. i would suggest salt, pepper, and a little hot sauce on top. my fatherinlaw got the mexican skillet which was delicious. it has hash browns, chorizo, roasted jalapeos, avocado, and two eggs over easy. finally my husband got the brisket hash which was so good as well. it had hash browns and eggs and a ton of brisket which tasted awesome. then we all got a side of pancakes and all of them were awesome. banana coconut cream, berry bliss, and oreo s'mores. my favorite of course was the oreo one. it was super rich so be prepared! the staff was very nice and helpful, and we will definitely come back next time we are in chicago!!"
828,Tiffany T.,1127,4,7/10/18,"the food is always great here. both breakfast and lunch! they also have different flavor lemonades and unlimited refills!! my go to breakfast is the garden skillet with well done potatoes, my boyfriend loves the chicken and waffles they add jalapenos and bacon in the batter! for lunch, i go for the veggie burger. the smoked gouda is to die for and they put crispy onion strings on top. what more could i ask for? my boyfriend will still get the chicken and waffles during lunch because he says it is that good! occasionally he will do the mexicana skillet, but that is only when he is in the mood for some chorizo. everyone else i have brought here loves everything they make, from the lemonades to the chipotle ranch to the burgers to the cookies n cream pancakes! they are all crowd pleasers! i love this place. plus, it is in a great location. near millennium park and just a few blocks from the shopping on state street. however, they are always busy on the weekends. i have seen three hour waits for this place. so, i recommend everyone to get the no wait app! it virtually puts you in line, that way you do not have to physically go there to put your name down. one down side is that you cannot do a no wait app for more than  people. the place is filled to the brim at all times and it feels a bit cramped. especially with all of the wait staff and huge parties. it is a big space, but it is still pretty cramped which is why i cannot give it a five star rating."
829,Elliot P.,1127,4,7/7/18,"a few friends and i had breakfast at wildberry while enjoying a weekend trip to chicago. we were all blown away by how great the food was and how energetic the staff interacted. i had the veggie omelet, which included asparagus other crisp vegetables. i have had tons of veggie omelets in the past, but this definitely ranked as a favorite. i also had the tiramisu pancakes and they were perfect. i love breakfast food, but i do not like when it is too dessertlike. even though these were tiramisu inspired, they were just sweet enough. also, get the orange juice. it is freshsqueezed. seriously tasted like they squeezed it after i ordered it."
830,Ryan G.,1127,4,6/19/18,excellent breakfast joint. they have tons of veggie options and even a few vegan ones too. my partner got the vegan hash and it was delicious. my egg white veggie omelette was better than any run of the mill omelette. they have breakfast down to a science! it is always packed but the wait was minimal given the throng headed into restaurant and the service was prompt and friendly.
831,Mindy D.,1127,5,6/17/18,"found this place through yelp when i searched for breakfastbrunch spots and was impressed by the high ratings from so many reviewers. my first time visiting chicago and i can see that this is a hot spot near millenniun park. our wait was . hours long but they send you a text when your table is ready. i ordered the house speciality signature berry bliss pancakes and the vegan patty which seemed to be from a seasonal menu. the pancakes were so fluffy and delightful, and i liked how it came with a side of fresh berries. the custard drizzling was sweet enough that it did not require any syrup. the vegan patty was also tasty and was cooked with veggies like spinach, mushroom, and onion topped off with slices of avocado. also came with hash browns and a side of toast. our server was very friendly, attentive, and quick. worth the wait for some scrumptious breakfast in downtown chi!"
832,Annie R.,1127,5,6/11/18,"i waited two hours for this shit and i would do it again every saturday. if you are in chicago, you have got to try it. our waiter, jeremy, played as big a role in this rating as the food. he was aggressive one of those people who talks at you for five seconds and leave you amused and, like, totally exhausted... you have got to get that coconut mocha... oh, you do not like coconut? when is the last time you tried it? i am getting it for you. let me know if you still do not like it and we will work something out. the coconut mocha rocked. the veggie skillet and the berry pancakes were good too, four star good. but jeremy was the best waiter i have had in months, five star good. and the portions! i left stuffed!! worth the money."
833,Emily B.,1127,4,6/11/18,"a great breakfast place!! just for you to be aware, they do not allow reservations, so if you come on the weekend be prepared to wait for a very long time. however, if you come in the mornings on random weekdays you are seated almost immediately. the pancakes are insanely light and fluffy and sooo jealous, and those are just the random buttermilk ones! the veggie omelette is my goto, just because it comes with sooo much. the omelette itself is enough for  meals and then it came with a choice of pancakes or toast, and then fruit or hash browns. i have also had their regular french toast which was incredible and my friend got the red velvet french toast which just looked like a dream. i have had friends also get the skillet which they said was massive but very tasty! always many people and a nice atmosphere!"
834,Sara J.,1127,5,6/9/18,"favorite breakfast spot! my fianc and i go almost every sunday! the check in process online is extremely fast and so convenient especially since we live right around the corner. the staff is so friendly and the food is very fresh and delicious. always extremely pleased with how tasty, not only the breakfast menu but lunch menu is as well. definitely recommend the barbacoa chilaquiles, veggie black bean burger, and nutella crepes!"
835,Heather L.,1127,4,6/7/18,"with over , reviews and a high yelp score  how can you not try this spot for brunch while in the area. it is only open until  pm so they only serve breakfast and lunch so i had high brunch hopes! we went on a weekday am and were shocked that there was still a wait albeit brief. once seated, i was a bit overwhelmed with the huge brunch menu. waitstaff was attentive and helped suggest some of the most popular items. i opted for the garden skillet  which was sort of the insides of an omelette  veggies in this case with hash browns mixed in topped wcheddar cheese and then your choice of eggs i did poached. it was sort of an inside out omelette which i liked. sort of a new take on the standard and it was really good. i opted for the side of buttermilk pancakes   really good pancakes. flaky, delicate, buttery goodness. this was a ton of food and i barely made a dent. my husband got the veggie omelette with pancakes for  including cheese. huge omelette and also well cooked and darn good. believe the reviews and give it a try  you will not be disappointed."
836,Susan W.,1127,4,6/6/18,"lots of food. the omelette came with a plateful of hashbrowns and pancakes on the side, for heaven's sake. got the mushroom omelette, and also tried my companion's veggie omelette liked both. everything was yummy. fast, friendly service. yes, it was crowded and noisy on a weekday lunch hour, but we were able to converse, and nobody was bumping elbows."
837,Sarina S.,1127,5,6/1/18,"pancake heaven! my first stop in chicago and it was a wonderful start to my weekend trip. yelpers should take advantage of signing up on the waitlist via yelp. super easy, put your name on the list and they give you an estimate when you will be called, how many parties are ahead of you, and text you when it is time to get seated. sunday morning at am, there was already an hour wait so definitely plan ahead. once seated, we ordered veggie omelet, breakfast platter with eggs, sausages and hash and the oreo s'mores pancakes. everything was delicious! all the entree comes with a variety of side choice so you can easily share an entree between two people. my favorite was the hash. the oreos pancakes were super sweet and tasted amazing, but it was too sweet to finish. service is great. our food came at a decent time and even though it was packed our waitress kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed."
838,Francesco L.,1127,4,12/12/17,"wildberrys is definitely a tourist spot, with its location and seemingly endless wait. however, they have this great feature where you can wait online via yelp. i strongly advise you enter the virtual line at least  hours prior to your desired eating time on the weekend. in terms of food, the red velvet french toast is tasty, but more of a dessert dish than an actual entree. we shared that at the table. i had the california fig omelette, which i recommend! the sweetness of the fig compliments the cheese and bacon mixed in with the egg. lastly, despite the packed restaurant and long wait, service is very fast. food came out within  minutes. the main reason they lost a star was due to the underestimated wait time of the virtual yelp line."
839,Erica K.,1127,4,11/6/17,"yummmm. great brunch place right next to millenium park. well, to be fair, my friends and i came here fairly early around  on a saturday morning, so we did not have to wait an insanely long time, which i know for some people, including myself, can ruin a food experience. we waited about  minutes for a table of . my friend and i split the red velvet roll french toast and their southern benedict. both were delicious! the red velvet french toast was a little too rich for me, but i mean, it is brunch  to be expected. the dough of the roll itself was soft and fluffy, topped with a sugary icing and filled with a slightly tart cream cheese custard. their southern benedict was nice and hardy  great fluffy biscuits to hold up to the slight spice of the sausage and the richness of the gravy. i thought it was a delicious interpretation of a benedict! a delicious brunch place close to many great things in chicago  i highly recommend coming here, but get a reservation if you can or come early so that you do not have to wait a long time. by the time we left, there was definitely an insanely long line."
840,Colleen M.,1127,4,11/3/17,"my baby sister and i went to wildberry in between buying day of tickets for a show and the matinee itself. we checked in online while waiting for the box office to open, and then walked to the cafe just in time for our reservation! they even gave us a red velvet french toast slice because we were celebrating our birthdays! so sweet! the playlist in the restaurant was on point. the only downside was we had to wait a while for our check, which was not a big deal, but just surprising, considering how busy they were."
841,Sonia T.,1127,5,10/30/17,"every time i visit chicago, i make it a point to stop by here! it is one of the best brunches i have ever had. honestly cannot go wrong with anything on this menu. if it is your first time, i recommend going with another person because that way you can try something savory and sweet! personal favorites berry bliss pancakes aptly named, red velvet french toast, florence benedict omg my mouth is watering thinking about it and the mexicana skillet"
842,Ricky L.,1127,4,8/29/17,"would definitely check out this place since it is so famous in chicago, but i am not sure it would be worth a second visit. the prices are definitely reasonable! we waited about an hour on friday at am to get in, and then got the southern eggs benedict, red velvet french toast, and the blueberry danish pancakes. the food came really quick which was a plus after the hour wait! the benedict and pancakes were perfect, but i expected a little more from the red velvet french toast. the french toast was basically three red velvet rolls with cream inside and topped with strawberries and cream. it was a little too sugary for my tastes, but that might be what you are looking for."
843,Ganes M.,1127,5,5/30/17,"the only thing i can really say that the other k  star reviews have not said is  definitely used the nowait app so you do not have to spend  hours waiting in line. when we first checked in, there were  parties ahead of us. if you are from out of town, check in online, then an hour before you are arrival time head down and your millennium park. the best morning the salsa is sooooo much better than you would expect from a midwest cafe. really underrated and a great complement to a pretty good breakfast burrito. the berry bliss pancakes is an absolute must. only . substitute for a different side. way better than other sides. order way more than you can actually eat and split it with the guys at your table. i love the skillets. red velvet is delicious as well!"
844,PB A.,1127,5,4/25/17,"thank you, wildberry, for the great start to our day! the red velvet french toast was excellent and the banana cream pancakes were light, fluffy, and tasty. pair them with eggs, hash browns, and sausage, and it was awwwwwesome!"
845,Lana N.,1127,5,3/21/17,delicious. red velvet toast was very unique and sweet without the syrup. i felt like it was more of rolled cake? garden skillet was amazing and cooked perfectly. fyi they will not let you sit down unless all parties are there.
846,Alyssa W.,1127,3,2/15/17,". i got here a little past  on sunday morning and the wait was already  hours with  parties ahead. i spent most of that time exploring millennium park and the park across from it. but if i did not have that to do, i probably would not wait again. my boyfriend and i ordered the butcher block skillet and the fresca omelette with bliss berry pancakes on the side. the skillet was tasty and filling, but the omlette was huge and bland. so i would suggest to get a meatier omelette or get a skillet instead. i actually wonder how many eggs were in my omelette. i was between the bliss berry pancakes and the red velvet french toast. i wish i had ordered the red velvet french toast because where else can you get that and because the pancakes were okay. i appreciate that they were fluffy and light, but the amount of syrups drizzled on the pancakes made me feel like it was more for kids. the fruits on the side for the pancakes were refreshing though. you are going to want to order everything on the menu just to try it all, but you can order a signature pancakefrench toast on the side of your egg dish for an extra . instead. interestingly, the brunch here is less greasy than i have seen anywhere else. but wildberry is nothing special. get their skillets and fluffy pancakes! and the service here is great  energetic, helpful and accommodating!"
847,Enrique F.,1127,5,2/11/17,had a great breakfast earlier second time coming and it was worth the  hour wait great food and i have to give it up to the bussers they are the reason this place is what it is they are on top of everything very helpful and nice my coffee stayed full the whole stay and if it was not for them being so attentive it would not be what this place is true definition of the way a restaurant should be ran red velvet roll too die for recommend to everyone will be back soon thanks for the great experience
848,Linda V.,1127,5,10/24/18,great brunch with charming and efficient service by shannon. no wait. denver skillet delicious
849,Donnie R.,1127,3,9/30/18,"nothing to brag home about. had the chorizo benedict, wife had denver omelette and we shared some berry pancakes. i was slightly disappointed with the chorizo coming from the west coast. decent food, but fast service. gets you in and out quick"
850,Erik J.,1127,5,9/27/18,"first stop in chicago. this place is about  min walk from our hotel, club quarters. i had the los altos benedict's, super good. had chorizo and chipotle hollandaise, just enough spice. wife had the denver skillet with jalapenos. no wait which is always nice, service was prompt, would definitely come back!"
851,Sehrish J.,1127,5,9/1/18,the wait time is crazy but the berry bliss pancakes are worth the wait! i was not too big a fan of the honey toffee nut latte. the denver skillet was also pretty good but the pancakes were on a whole other level!
852,Brionna E.,1127,5,7/29/18,one of the best breakfast establishments. being able to join a waitlist on yelp is very convenient because they are always busy. the staff is super friendly and time efficient. the food is always delicious and they portion sizes are good for their affordable prices. the denver skillet is one of my fav entrees. their specialty waffles and pancakes are also very good. i highly recommend this restaurant.
853,Kristen G.,1127,5,7/20/18,"long wait, but very much worth it. my denver skillet was filling, pretty, and tasted great  and not expensive at all. as a tourist, i would definitely repeat this place during a trip."
854,Sean M.,1127,5,7/3/18,"so, the secret is out, and this place is pure fire. nevertheless, loved it so much that i felt compelled to write this review. came here on sunday, july , and had to wait a long time, but we booked through no wait. the folks doing the checkin as well as the team behind the desk in the entryway were all so, so friendly in spite of the heat and the hordes of people waiting for a table. we were seated outside with dylan, and though he was slammed, he did not show it. he gave us spectacular service, and the food was to die for. i had the denver skillet, and these guys make arguably the best skillet known to man. i would come back time and time again. thanks for the great experience, wildberry!"
855,Tala P.,1127,5,7/2/18,such great service from the moment we walked in the door to the server and more. the food was incredible and the portions were great. i was pleased with everything.  cleanliness was on point including the bathrooms. the location is great and i really enjoyed the avocado with toast and eggs and my boyfriend enjoyed the denver scramble. thank you for the great experience!
856,Joanne K.,1127,4,6/30/18,"order the pancakes, and just the pancakes. they are light and fluffy and heavenly pillows of happiness. the signature berry bliss pancakes are tart and fruity, while the banana coconut cream takes exactly like a luscious banana creme pie. i took one star off because the other breakfast dishes like the denver skillet and the napa valley fig omelette were not too impressive in taste, flavor, and presentation. the eggs were dry and the figs were not fresh and juicy. the portions are huge, so you will definitely have leftovers. your focus here should really be the amazing pancakes because it is what they do best. heck, their name is wildberry pancakes! just stick with lots of pancakes of different flavors."
857,Jennifer M.,1127,5,6/29/18,"great breakfast and service! we will definitely return! the denver skillet, mexican skillet, caramel latte were all really good. the portion was huge so we could not finish. our waitress was very nice and attentive."
858,Adianez F.,1127,5,6/11/18,wildberry is hands down one of my favorite breakfast places of all time. it might be due to the fact that pancakes and eggs skillets are my favorite breakfast dishes. everything about this place was great. not just the food. the people were sweet and the service was excellent. hands down i recommend this place to anyone visiting chicago. tried signature berry bliss pancakes denver sizzling skillets
859,Allie P.,1127,5,5/24/18,"i am not a big fan of pancakes. in fact, i do not like pancakes at all, buuut their berry bliss pancakes...holy moly! i have had dreams about this pancakes ever since! as agnes from despicable me would say, it is so fluffy! seriously their pancakes are something else and add the denver sizzlin' skillets, you have the perfect sweet and savory combo! not to mention their portions were very generous, leaving you full & happy! i am so glad that i decided to forgo my fancy brunch spot that i had bookmarked prior to my trip to chicago and try this place instead. and thank you to my awesome uber driver for recommending the items on the menu because it was phenomenal! oh and you can check in to the restaurant by joining their waitlist on the yelp app and you will be added to the queue, so you do not have to wait in person for too long! i checked in an hour prior to arriving at the restaurant and only waited  minutes to be seated. winning!"
860,Neisha F.,1127,5,5/20/18,"i have tried both locations! they never disappoint! i love the veggie skillet, slow cooked brisket, denver skillet, and the cinnamon roll pancakes! kid friendly and definitely worth the wait! if your know you are going use the waitlist app to reserve a virtual place!"
861,Thomas O.,1127,4,4/24/18,if you visit chicago this is a must eat! and yes i wrote that in bold because i am screaming it. we ordered their skillets which also come with pancakes. i got the denver skillet with apple caramel pecan pancakes. my mom got garden skillet with strawberry poppyseed pancakes. the skillets were huge and hearty. i would have liked to see a tad bit more seasoning to them but nonetheless still a favorite. my mom's strawberry pancakes were topped with a lemon cream which was finger licking good. i found myself dipping my pancakes in her lemon cream. so if you go there you must get those!
862,Aaron G.,1127,5,4/20/18,denver skillet and mexicana skillet are excellent. love this place. i like the fact that i can use yelp to join the wait list. signature pancakes are amazing. nuff said!
863,Chris C.,1127,4,4/19/18,"great breakfast spot in the mag. mile area. the service was really good and we both liked our very late breakfast. i had the denver sizlin skillet, with their awesome pancakes and the skillet itself was more than i could eat. the pancakes are great, and we tried two different varieties. gf had an omelette that was also really good, and everything came with coffee from a local roaster that was excellent."
864,Maria O.,1127,5,4/18/18,"had the denver skillet with turkey sausage. well seasoned and the egg was perfectly runny on top. i got the chocolate chip pancakes with no banana as the side. the pancakes were super fluffy and sweet. overall, great experience, the waitress was very attentive and friendly and the place was fun and inviting."
865,Stacy H.,1127,5,4/8/18,"thank goodness for the yelp waitlist! my friends and i just hung around millennium park until there were roughly  parties ahead of us and then we started walking toward the restaurant. my boyfriend ordered the hot chocolate to start. pretty average hot chocolate  nothing special. so on to the entrees, i got the denver skillet and the signature berry bliss pancakes. a great mix of sweet and savory but you will for sure have leftovers if you are a smaller woman like me, but no complaints! will definitely be back!"
866,Lily G.,1127,5,2/20/18,"amazing! suggestion especially on the weekends it is a good idea to arrive before am, otherwise be prepared for an  hr wait minimum. the location is fantastic as it is across millenium park so it is convenient if you are planning on scratching off cloud gate off your list. the food is excellent as well as the service. we were a group of  and everyone absolutely loved the food. everyone said the pancakes were amazing. we tried the butcher block skillet, denver skillet, fried chicken and waffles, classic eggs benedict, banana and chocolate chip pancakes, cinnamon pancakes, oreo s'mores pancakes and their regular pancakes all fantastic!"
867,Dalena D.,1127,5,8/18/18,"californian traveling to chicago! food  stars you must try this place if you are traveling to chicago! there is a reason why they have k reviews on yelp! my friend and i split in half  orders of food  los altos eggs benedict and the slow roast brisket. i ordered the los altos eggs benedict and omg the first bite was a burst of flavors! it was so flavorful that i was sad to trade my friend my other half of the plate! haha the slow roast brisket was also very rich in flavors and the brisket was veeeeery tender! both portions were waaaay to big for  girls...and i eat a lot for a girl lol.the los altos benedict has to be my top pick between these two. because the signature berry bliss pancakes was one of their popular items.... even though we knew we ordered way too much already... we decided to try it anyway hahaha ragrets haha the pancakes were amazing though! super fluffy, fresh fruits, good portion size unfortunately, we were too full to finish it we left this place absolutely stuffed with lots of left overs! if you are traveling from out of this area, i highly recommend you try this place! service  stars join the waitlist! this yelp feature saved my life so many times! the wait was suppose to be  hour and  mins for  people but we waited only  mins because we joined the waitlist from home. there was atleast  people in the waiting area and we bypass all of them! even if you did not put your name on the waitlist, there is plenty of things to do around there to kill time like walk around millennium park. they will text you so hang around because it is definitely worth it! the food takes time to make but that is when you know it is fresh. the wait is worth it!!!!"
868,Reta B.,1127,1,8/15/18,"first time visiting chicago and i checked on yelp places to eat, wildberry pancakes was on the top list to try so i thought why not i can give it a try. i made yelp reservation and it was about  mins but by the time i walked and got to the restaurant, it was perfect timing. i looked on yelp for recommendations and i saw the benedict's so i got the los altos benedict , it has the chorizo sausage and i do not eat there so i substituted it for avocado. so i got my food, and for fresh orange juice. the avocado was dark!! the food tasted disgusting!! the eggs were really runny unlike the way it usually is for benedict's. i do not recommend it to anybody. i would go somewhere else and try something else, not worth the wait. i also think it is over rated."
869,Roz T.,1127,4,8/3/18,"we had come here from a recommendation from a guy on our lyft ride and it was delicious! my friend had the corned beef hash benedict , i had the los altos benedict and we shared one of the new pancakes they had, the blackberry key lime pie. my friend said that her corned beef was pretty heavy and mine was pretty spicyoily for my taste. but omg the pancakes were amazing!! highly recommend for the pancakes!!"
870,Brianna V.,1127,5,7/28/18,"yum yum yum! the hype of this place is all real! the food is amazing, best place i ate in chicago during my visit. tip use yelp for the line waitlist, it is very useful, but they seem to get through their waits fairly quick signature berry bliss  this is exactly what they are known for, it comes as pancakes, waffles, and crepes. i am more of a waffle kind of girl, but i am sure having it on any of the other options would be just as amazing! the fruit and berry whipped cream is the perfect combo and and not too street on the waffles, i cannot imagine any other waffles beating these! los altos benedict  the chorizo is a bit on the spicier side, but the benedict and hash browns together makes an awesome bite"
871,Maling H.,1127,4,4/26/18,"i read other people's suggestion to join the waitlist on yelp so i added us on the waitlist at am and was told to come around am. we came at  and we still had wait an additional  mins which was not too bad. i ordered the los altos benedict . it was pretty good. instead of the hash browns, i asked them to sub it in for their berry bliss pancakes. the pancakes were delicious. my bf ordered the homemade biscuit and gravy. he liked it. he ordered a side of cinnamon pancakes and it was pretty good. solid brunch spot but i do feel it is a little overrated."
872,Michelle M.,1127,4,3/12/18,"my husband, sister, and i had breakfast at wildberry pancakes and cafe our first morning in chicago. we woke up early to beat the crowd. it was not until i checked in on the yelp app that i realized we could have added ourselves to the waitlist prior to our arrival. luckily our wait was under  minutes. once we were seated we immediately ordered coffee. the lattes are huge and are decorated with cute foam art. my sister and i ordered the los altos benedict with chorizo, roasted red peppers, and pico de gallo. the dish was served with a huge portion of hash brown potatoes. the eggs were perfectly poached and balanced well with the spicy pico de gallo. while the hash browns were nice and crispy on the top, they were under seasoned. my husband's chicken and waffles were a little underwhelming. while i enjoyed the candied bacon i would not have known there were jalapenos in the waffle had they not been staring back at me. the fried chicken tenders were overcooked and dry. while there were some hits and misses with our meal i would definitely return and try the signature berry pancakes on our next visit."
873,Katherine L.,1127,5,2/5/18,the los altos benedict was great! a bit greasy but the english muffin was a showstopper. definitely tasted the heat come through but lightly. the classic benedict was delicious! the ham served was like butter in my mouth and i would have just eaten that and that alone! almond joy mocha was on the sweeter side and the mint mocha was only slightly minty. service was great! food was delivered fast 
874,Cristina N.,1127,5,1/22/18,"probably the best breakfast i have ever had!!! portions are huge, if you eat little, i suggest to share a plate. so many places claim to have freshly squeezed oj but never is, however this one was legit. we had los altos benedict , mexican skillet, berry bliss pancakes outstanding and strawberry and chocolate chip waffles. everything was perfectly delicious!!!!"
875,Helen P.,1127,5,1/7/18,"wildberry pancakes and cafe is amazing. i went here with my boyfriend when we went to chicago last week. let me just say that this was hands down one of our favorite brunch places of all time. i do not normally enjoy pancakes, but wow, their pancakes are good. we tried the cinnamon one and the berry one. both were amazing but i liked the berry one more. for their entrees, i got the los altos benedict , and it was soooo good! everything about it was delicious. my boyfriend, who does not normally like benedicts , loved this dish. he got the espanola omelette which was delicious as well. their coffee is also intelligensia coffee! the wait is super long, but you can reserve a spot on yelp ahead of time. we reserved a spot on yelp at am then got there at am to check in. we got seated at around am. definitely do this if you plan on going."
876,Thien N.,1127,5,10/2/17,i did not know that this place had a reputation for their food. their wait was long but it was well worth it. everything worked like clockwork. the service was great and the food was better. i had the los altos benedict with a side of fruit and my friend gave me half her pancake. everything was extraordinary. the chorizo on the eggs benedict was definitely a nice twist. the pancake was great and the fruit tasted fresh. great brunch place that is well worth the wait and definitely worth checking out if you are in chicago.
877,Michael S.,1127,4,9/28/17,"it is my first time in chicago and this was definitely a good place for a first meal in town. i was craving a hearty brunch meal and they definitely delivered. i had a los altos benedict as soon as i saw the word chorizo. very quick turnaround after i ordered. good taste and very satisfying. one of the biscuit was a little tough but it was not too bad. also, one of the staff members forgot to bring the tabasco i requested. overall a good experience, but not perfect."
878,Levi M.,1127,5,8/25/17,i have never left a yelp review before but had to for this place. holy crap everything is delicious! i have never had eggs benedict before but decided to try the los altos benedict . wow!!! explosion of flavor and extremely delicious! i am from arizona so i love the spicey aspect to this dish. we will for sure be revisiting.
879,Milad N.,1127,5,7/6/17,"great place for brunch. we came here on a saturday around  am and the wait was around an hour. the wait would have been a bit shorter if we wanted a table inside but we had our puppy with us and we had to sit outside. we did not know that you could check in using the app, so that is what we are going to do next. either way, the place is right next to millennium park, so it is easy to kill an hour. we had the los altos benedict , southern benedict , and a bliss berry pancake with orange juice fresh squeezed and a latte. the food was unbelievably and definitely worth the wait. i would  recommend this place and also encourage people to make a reservation before hand using their app."
880,Josh V.,1127,5,7/6/17,everything we ordered was amazing and had great presentation. from the oreo s'more pancakes to the cinnamon roll pancakes to the los altos benedict . there was a long wait but well worth it because it was great food with big portions at a fair price. also helped that they had a waitlist program built into yelp which also showed your spot in line.
881,Sarfraz K.,1127,4,6/13/17,"there are so many good brunch places in chicago downtown, but when we moved to the suburbs, we could not find a good brunch place in the burbs. enter wildberry  fast service, great food and a ton of options. only issue is it gets rather busy so be prepared to wait. personal favorites los altos benedict , mexicana skillet and the signature blueberry bliss pancakes"
882,Qamar A.,1127,5,5/30/17,it is very rare that you get a perfect meal and that is what i just finished los altos benedict ... it was just right! loved the service and the ambience. the wait was worth the while. it is a must place for people in chicago!
883,Sherrie B.,1127,1,11/9/18,attitude of staff at the front is brutal. they were rude. and i think they enjoyed telling me it was another min wait. we are from out of town and i would not recommend wildberry. the front staff needs to be friendlier and a little more empathetic. we are hungry and cold. wait staff and food were good but not worth the attitude from the front. be sure to get the app nowait. helpful to minimize your waittime. i would not go back here.
884,Amber F.,1127,1,10/28/18,"we arrived here and they told us hr  min wait. while we were waiting, someone in our party realized that they forgot their phone at the hotel. they left to get it. our table was ready  minutes later, but they would not seat us....,. because the person in our party was not there.... even if we said we know what they wanted to order. it is ridiculous to tell someone  hr min wait for something that should only take  minutes. it is the same reason our party was not there at the time our table was ready. it is also ridiculous not to seat us because of it...... especially since we were willing to order for the missing person. i would rather the management tall guy just be a little more obvious about how they intend to treat you through the meal.... you get  minutes in the restaurant and they want to flip you out. also... they way they asked us was embarrassing. i think there are so many more really nice options around chicago to have breakfast..... and where they do not treat you like a cow at the feeding trough."
885,Jo B.,1127,1,9/30/18,"what is all the fuss about? standard diner with very standard food. actually, maybe below standard food. my eggs were lukewarm, unseasoned and the chicken sausage too sweet. the coffee was just meh. seriously, skip the lines and find yourself a place that cares about what they serve"
886,Larry M.,1127,1,9/10/18,"visiting from out of state and decided to wait and try this place after seeing the thousands of reviews. while the service was great, everything else is far over hyped and not worth the wait. far better and less hassle breakfast places to go to when visiting."
887,Jess M.,1127,1,8/23/18,"wondering what the hype is about this place. seriously i could have had a better breakfast at ihop. my hash browns were burnt, the berry pancakes had a very artificial taste and the chicken sausage were just weird. i see another  star review from an out of town person. i too do not live in chicago, just visiting. maybe we just have higher expectations for brunch. i agree with the other  star review, the food was disgusting."
888,Josh E.,1127,1,8/18/18,"the most disgusting management in business, they deceive customers to their establishment, only to tell them they have to wait  minutes after  checking in meanwhile i just wasted my entire morning. they should be ashamed of their business practice especially when the host says  oh that check in time is just to get you here  that is bull #!...my entire morning is wasted"
889,Reta B.,1127,1,8/15/18,"first time visiting chicago and i checked on yelp places to eat, wildberry pancakes was on the top list to try so i thought why not i can give it a try. i made yelp reservation and it was about  mins but by the time i walked and got to the restaurant, it was perfect timing. i looked on yelp for recommendations and i saw the benedict's so i got the los altos benedict, it has the chorizo sausage and i do not eat there so i substituted it for avocado. so i got my food, and for fresh orange juice. the avocado was dark!! the food tasted disgusting!! the eggs were really runny unlike the way it usually is for benedict's. i do not recommend it to anybody. i would go somewhere else and try something else, not worth the wait. i also think it is over rated."
890,M F.,1127,1,8/12/18,the host team was surly. i arrived at . there were a lot of people waiting and more coming in. i was told it would be about a half hour. at  i asked the hostess how much longer. she said there were two ahead of us. after watching all the people get seated and waiting about another half hour we were seated. food was what i expected. chain food where the tastiness comes from high fat content rather than culinary skill. meh.
891,Sarah S.,1127,1,8/1/18,"we waited almost an hour but the food was pretty good, not necessarily worth the wait, but good. i am giving the restaurant one stars since soon after eating i got sick with food poisoning, which obviously ruined the entire day."
892,Delilah L.,1127,1,7/20/18,ordered carryout of broccoli cheese soup. so disappointed. it was basically broccoli water with a handful of shredded cheese thrown in. and the cheese was likely fake cheese because it did not even warm up when microwaved. i wish i would known before leaving. but i would not order again.
893,Travis H.,1127,1,7/18/18,had food poisoning from the mexicana skillet. just landed in chicago and this was the first place i went to. got to my airbnb and was plagued with a very heavy stomach ache. continued to vomit for a long period of time. i assume it was from the salsa as i tasted salsa while throwing up round after round. awful experience
894,Sierra S.,1127,1,7/10/18,"i was in chicago for a business trip. i had their fresh squeezed orange juice as i was waiting for my carry out order & i ended up having to be rushed to the emergency room. i had a life threatening allergic reaction to the orange juice. my co worker called while i was in the emergency & they were extremely rude & unhelpful. i spoke to the manager at their location downtown & he hung up on me. since i have seen an allergy specialist & i am not allergic to oranges i knew i was not. i am however very allergic to mold therefore i must have been given a bad orange that almost caused me my life. their management is horrible, this business is only in it for the money. ohh one more thing...before the manager hung up on me he mentioned that if, if i bring him my blood work they would provide me with a refund and a gift card....such a joke."
895,Christine T.,1127,1,7/4/18,"i agree with michael s. this is definitely a tourist trap. the wait was over  hours! luckily our hotel was nearby and we were able to checkin via yelp. even then, the wait after we got the text was long!! hubby and i shared the chorizo benedict, turkey sausage, and eggs. nothing to rave about. it is comparable to your average diner or denny's. note to restaurant fix your ac!!"
896,Liz S.,1127,1,6/10/18,"was not impressed! my party choose to sit outside to enjoy the day when we were showered with seeds from nearby trees! it was bad! while i insert these things happen, the manager never came to speak to us! we were never invited to sit inside or move to where the seeds were not falling directly on us. we were unable to eat our meal! we were pulling seeds off our hair the rest of the day. management had a lack of empathy toward the situation, hence the one star."
897,Cara S.,1127,1,5/29/18,what can i say? not a huge fan of chain restaurants. i did not even realize they were a chain until i asked for real maple syrup and received a blank stare. sigh. maybe next time...
898,Colleen G.,1127,1,5/13/18,"would not recommend this place if you have a gluten or any other allergies. they clearly do not care about protecting customers or about health restrictions or preferences. we ordered one order of regular pancakes and one order of glutenfree pancakes for takeout. when we got home, the  orders looked exactly the same. the manager on the phone said that next time we order we should check with him and he would look at the pancakes and tell us which one is gluten free. i would never trust the opinion of a restaurant manager looking at my pancakes to tell me if they are gluten free. if your health depends on the accuracy of the restaurant and trusting them with what you order i would not recommend going to this place. the manager was extremely rude on the phone as well and all he offered me was to come back in to get some more questionably gluten free pancakes. we will not be ordering from here again. and would never wait  hours to eat in at this average chain restaurant when there are endless other options in chicago."
899,Marion L.,1127,1,5/11/18,i do not do bad reviews usually but this place is ridiculous. my wife was waiting for a four top i ran by to grab lunch as she had ordered me a to go plate. then i was going to sit outside with plenty of empty tables on a rainy day and down the food which was ok do not know the price point though as my wife had ordered and paid already. the rude staff stopped me from sitting and had the manager come tell that was not allowed since i was not ordering. that is beyond ridiculous and shows a no customer attitude. i would not eat here again for anything. rude not accommodating and definitely has the cow herd mentality. go here if you like being pushed through a stall for your food.
900,Cristina F.,1127,1,5/4/18,"i debated for the last hour on whether i should write this review or not. i prefer to not write bad reviews of my last  reviews, only  reviews had  stars or less. however, i had a weird experience at wildberry earlier today and the more i think about it, the more it does not sit well with me. it was my friend's birthday and we decided on wildberry because it was close to my job. i ended up getting out earlier so i walked over to put my name in. the hostess was not friendly but i assumed it was for efficiency sake. i told her, cristina for  people and we would like to sit outside. she looked dazed so i repeated myself, cristina c are i s ti n a without the h. she was dismissive about that and told me it would be a  minute wait. i asked her if it was for outside seating and she looked annoyed and said yes. this whole interaction could not have taken more than a minute. i did not take offense. i was in a celebratory mood, the weather was gorgeous, my project just ended and it was my friend's birthday. fast forward ish minutes later, our table was ready so i checked inagain unfriendly service. this hostess a different one cut me off before i could even finish saying cristina table for  with yeah we will call out your name. by this time, i was like okaaaaay, damn. not even five minutes later, another host the rd one was calling out, china for , china for . i ignored himbecause that is not my name. but all three of them were looking at us and finally, my friend was like i think they mean you lol. alright, sure this has never happened to me before but whatever. this host proceeded to seat us inside and i was like, no i specifically asked to sit outside. he gets mad and barks, you are going to have to wait longer so do you want this table or not? if you want to sit outside, you will wait longer. i told him we already waited  minutes and he repeated himself about waiting longer. i was weirded out by his aggressiveness so i turned to my friend and she is like yeah we will wait. we walk back to the desk. by this time, i am annoyed so i talked to the hostesses and i told them i specifically asked to sit outside and how long is the wait. the dazed one just looked at me blankly and the one who cut me off before glared at me and snapped you will get the first available table. as i am writing this, i really have no idea why i did not hulk out hahah. i hate rude peoplethere is absolutely no excuse for rude behavior especially when you are in the service industry. we finally got our tableand our server natalie was great. our food was deliciouswith enormous portions. we ordered the mexicana skillet, the fresca omelet on natalie's recommendation and a side of the cinnamon roll pancakes on the recommendation of the table next to us. but i definitely will not come back here. there should be zero tolerance for this kind of behavior. if you are going to be front of the house, you need to have better customer service skills. is it too much to ask for a host to listen to my name, not cut me off, and actually get my seat preference correct? if it is too much to ask, then at the very least, it is definitely not too much to acknowledge your errors and apologize. also, i am asian but not chinese."
901,Joseph W.,1127,1,4/28/18,such a crazy place with a long wait for everything to be just below average. if you want better quality yolk is or bongo room are totally better and less of a ridiculous wait. the service is also not that great. maybe would only be back if it was a quick convenient meal during lunch break ir something but with that long wait not even! just will not be back
902,Shamim M.,1127,1,4/26/18,"the food is good, not great. absolutely not worth the wait. the pancakes are loaded with unnecessary sugar."
903,Marissa G.,1127,1,4/22/18,"after waiting  hours to get in to wildberry my experience only got worse! besides the serve's lack of knowledge of the menu, my food had  short black hairs in it! oscar had my order remade which also came back wrong! with that long of a wait, reputation and the high prices i was expecting much better at least from a customer service stand point. i would not recommend and will never be going back! try sweet waters or nutella around the corner. they they put this place to shame!"
904,Denise L.,1127,1,3/28/18,"heard so much about wildberry and knew there would be a wait at this popular place even on a wednesday morning. we were put on the wait list and used no wait app as suggested. after  minutes we received a message that our table was ready. except that it was not. we were told to wait in the teeny entrance area that was jam packed with customers and our name would be called. we asked if we could please wait outside because there was no place to stand. we were told no. a horrible manager then yelled at us when we were standing in the only available space we could find.  minutes later we were seated. terrible, terrible service. my only question why did we put up with this abuse? food was good, but definitely not worth the shabby treatment we received."
905,Krystyle G.,1127,1,3/25/18,i ordered a garden skillet veggies and at the bottom it had a few pieces of ham in it. i was also told they use the same gloves for all the skillets because the meat is precooked. never again.
906,Holly H.,1127,1,3/25/18,"was so excited to try this place while i was in town, waited an hour and a half and got food so bad i had to send it back. even after all that they still got our bill wrong. long wait, plus mediocre service, plus bad food = a really disappointing chicago dining experience. would never recommend or return."
907,PriSil P.,1127,1,3/25/18,"our experience at wildberry was unpleasant. first the server told us they have no vegan option besides oatmeal. it is unacceptable that a place that servers people from all over world have made no efforts to include vegan costumers. my husband who is not vegan had waffles and i had the oatmeal. waffle was good while the oat meal was tasteless. right after we paid before we left the table while we still had our belongings there, people already started cleaning up the table, took our drinks away before we had finished them and started setting it for the next costumers. it is definitely a overpriced and overhyped place to which we will not came back."
908,Mehdi L.,1127,1,3/24/18,totally overrated not worth the wait mediocre pancakes tourist trap. service was awful very slow i have had better branches and so many other places in chicago
909,Gary W.,1127,1,3/18/18,"this place has terrible service! the waiter took our change and did not bring our money back to the table for the change! i asked multiple times to bring our money back and they refused to bring money back our table, as we waited for  mins. do not go. food is beyond gross, along with the service!! extremely rude!! i suggest picking elsewhere!"
910,Allison B.,1127,1,3/8/18,after reading many positive reviews for this spot my boyfriend i decided we just had to stop for breakfast here while we were in chicago for the weekend. what a mistake. the whole restaurant was similar to an ihop and had basically the same quality food. the whole atmosphere was very get you in and get you out as fast as possible. we ordered banana chocolate chip pancakes expecting pancakes with bananas and chocolate chips in them. boy were we wrong. they simply mass produce plain pancakes and then throw the toppings on top. one of the most disappointing meals ever. i am sad we wasted an opportunity to hit another great spot for this beyond subpar food. do not bother waiting the over an hour wait for pancakes you could easily make yourself.
911,Melanee N.,1127,1,3/3/18,"great, great food but not worth the long wait times and extremely rude customer service! my family and i paid a visit to the wildberry location within prudential tower in chicago. we checked in, waited for our table and eventually we were seated. for starters, we had to wait at the table for at least  minutes before our waiter, jeremy, even came over to ask if we wanted anything to drink. we sat down to a table still being cleaned and the check from the previous patrons still being on the table. when jeremy finally came over to the table, he was extremely rude and came off with an attitude because of how my mother addressed how we were waiting for so long without receiving a simple i will be right with you guys from him, which is just common courtesy from a waiter to hisher customer. jeremy's response to my mother was extremely condescending to her, saying well the quicker that we start talking about what you all want to eat, the faster this process can go so what you want. at that point we were wanting to just leave the restaurant, because how dare you speak that condescending and rudely to customers who have waited over two and a half hours to be seated to have breakfast at your establishment, which gives us nothing for free  while laughing and carrying on so politely with other families and customers at other tables throughout the restaurant. we placed our drinks order and once jeremy returned with the drinks, we placed our food orders  which he rushed us through while ordering. at this point, i believe that he could see that we were unsatisfied with the service and tried to tone down the manner in which he was speaking to us, but we were already annoyed and unpleased with him as a waiter. our meals came and the food was great, as it usually is when we visit the resturaunt  however if i am paying for a service and am a customer within an establishment i expect to be treated a certain way and have waiters and waitresses who knows how to give customer service to their patrons. we have also been frequent customers to this wildberry location, until february of last year, , where we had another run in with a rude worker named kevin, who spoke to my family again in a very disrespecting and rude manner due to an issue with seatings and reservations. my sister wrote in to the company again was offered a free meal to us however we were so disgusted with the service that we received then that we have not returned until today and never bothered to take up the offer from you, which shows how the service has not improved at all from a lot of the waiters and waitresses that are working for wildberry."
912,Steph T.,1127,1,2/26/18,"everybody raved about this place saying was the best in town, well i disagree. everything comes on a. ed of hash brown plus hash. browns on the side. it is nothing more then a starch bowl with little else. do not bother."
913,Neuy D.,1127,1,2/23/18,"they have a wait app that texts you early so you and  other people wait in a cramped lobby waiting for them to call your name while people spill coffee on you, bump into and step on your feet. and no, you cannot wait outside we asked because once they summon you via txt early, they have no way of texting you again when your table is actually ready or even stick their head outside the door and call your name. unbelievable on how terrible this policy is."
914,Salome H.,1127,1,2/19/18,"impossible to get to this place. tried three days in the row and it was impossible. the only thing i can provide opinion is about the coffee to go!!! really good!!! only reason went three days because was close to the hotel and because the coffee beans used are from a good brand from cali, otherwise not worthy to wait for a table to eat pancakes."
915,Victoria W.,1127,1,2/18/18,the wait is a joke! we were told  minutes we are now here for  hours. not sure why we are stupid enough to be sitting here for breakfast food. we live in the neighborhood... we will absolutely not come here anymore.
916,Paula B.,1127,1,2/14/18,"very unpleasant experience to say the least. service hit or miss. very inconsistent. i checked in with one of the five or six hostesses and i am told the wait is  minutes. no big deal. after about  minutes or so, a man standing by the host stand calls my name paula. i approach the stand and say, i am paula. did you call my name? this man and one of the hostesses decide to completely ignore me not once but twice! i go back to my corner wishing to see where this was going. after about  more minutes, i approach the host stand again and ask the same question, to which the man who originally called my name continues to ignore me while the hostess tells me i have to wait  more minutes after they call my name which by now it would be a  minute wait after they first called my name. i would suggest for management first train your staff not to ignore diners when they are asked a question and secondly, do not call names if you are not ready to sit diners right away. service again tableware was placed across the table from me. one set of tableware so this bus boy had to know i was just one person dining, not me and my ghost. management teach staff to place tableware where the diner is sitting and not where the ghost is sitting. this was ridiculous. food mexicana skillet hash browns, cheddar & jack cheese,  eggs, chorizo sausage, jalapeos, avocado, cilantro & onions. . the avocado or cilantro were nowhere to be found in my skillet. the egg whites on the sunny side up were raw. huhhuh. had to send my skillet back to the kitchen which came back without the hot sauce. so suggestion to management do not advertise something that is not going to be delivered. pancakes were fine based on standard diner food. coffee was probably the best part of the dining experience. service again and this deserves a star. my waitress was very professional, friendly, attentive, fast and accommodating. unfortunately, the tone for my dining experience had been set from the start. atmosphere very unpleasant loud, crowded, unbearably hot inside. the place smells like a wet dog in a sauna. based on the wonderful reviews, apparently some people like that."
917,Tracee A.,1127,1,2/11/18,stood in line for over  hours for an overhyped denny's situation! i was so outdone with the lackluster food! a huge time waster!
918,DAVID C.,1127,1,2/4/18,because this place has outdoor seating and is across from millennial park it gets an abundance of tourists. the food does look good walking by. so we decided to go for lunch. i had a salad that cost  and was made up of mostly shredded iceberg lettuce. i asked the waiter where the avocado was that was supposed to be in the salad. it took them awhile before they got it but were trying to get away from putting it in the salad. service was slow and we got attitude like they were doing us a favor by serving us. you end up getting served by millennials who think the world owes them a favor across from millennial park.
919,Saeed M.,1127,1,1/16/18,"this place is the highest rated restaurant in chicago, sad!!! giving a  star review to this place is like giving a  star review to mcdonald's. and you wonder why you people are so eat of shape and unhealthy... life does not get any worse when the important meal of the day is absolute junk food consisted of buttload of sugar and fat... your doctors must love the money you spend on them!"
920,Tiffany W.,1127,1,12/17/17,"my one star is based on a combination of things. i was added to the wait list at am and was given a wait time of  minutes. i was seated at pm. we placed our orders and the food took  minutes to arrive. the waitress stated the kitchen was extremely backed up. i ordered the eggs, applewood bacon, hashtowns and apple caramel pecan pancakes. my daughter ordered the same but with brioche french toast. honestly, there was nothing special or spectacular about this breakfast. i found the pancakes to be fluffy but dry and bland. the apples and pecan did not add enough to hide the boring pancakes. prices seemed fair and reasonable. the atmosphere was average. the time is took to get a table and get served food is just not worth the wait. our experience was roughly  hours. my office is a few blocks away so perhaps during a slower weekday would have been better, however the food is not good enough for a second visit. i recommend going to any other breakfast spots in the loop yolk, corner bakery, batter and berries just to save yourself some time. wildberry gets a thumbs down from me."
921,Melissa M.,1127,1,10/15/17,"we waited three hours because he reviews were so terrific. our pancakes were dry. they did not have any fruit cooked into them, just a little dumped on top. the fruit tray was unripe cheap fruit. it was awful. we really felt like we wasted a lot of our time on this restaurant."
922,Garth S.,1127,1,10/14/17,"take a pass on wildberry, it is completely overrated. if you are looking for a loud, crowded restaurant with mediocre food, by all means. i was completely underwhelmed by the menu selection and food was just poorly done. i should have known when even their coffee was bitter and over priced. our waitress was great but that was the best part of our visit. my food was bland, tasteless and looked awful. their description set improper expectations and what i got should not have left the kitchen. the sausage gravy was not awful, but there was something about it i cannot place. it was not very good despite a good amount of sausage and a good consistency. my wife had the eggs benedict and it looked good at least. the eggs tasted like pure salt though. they put way too much salt in the poaching water. she could not finish her meal and i sent my be back. needless to say we will not be back. save yourself a wait, it is not worth it."
923,Maling H.,1127,4,4/26/18,"i read other people's suggestion to join the waitlist on yelp so i added us on the waitlist at am and was told to come around am. we came at  and we still had wait an additional  mins which was not too bad. i ordered the los altos benedict. it was pretty good. instead of the hash browns, i asked them to sub it in for their berry bliss pancakes. the pancakes were delicious. my bf ordered the homemade biscuit and gravy. he liked it. he ordered a side of cinnamon pancakes and it was pretty good. solid brunch spot but i do feel it is a little overrated."
924,Sara H.,1127,4,7/19/18,"who is big fan of brunch food? i am! my friend and i visited here am in the morning after seeing the bean. we were lucky that there was no line to wait especially when i heard that you have to wait a hour to get into this place. we were quickly seated in a spacious table. our waiter was friendly and attentive. we order egg benedict and their famous berry pancake. oh my gosh...the pancake was the most fluffiest and soft pancake i ever had in life. it was spongy, moist, warm and fluffy that i felt like i was eating cloud. the warm pancake was filled with fresh berries that burst in my mouth. this is what i called a breakfastbrunch food! the portion is huge at reasonable price. i personally did not like egg benedict. i had better ones but pancake is worth having! every bite was heavenly. i would love to go back to try different pancake!"
925,Mandy W.,1127,3,8/9/18,"expect a long wait of  hour to . hours on a sunday morning. you can track your wait time through yelp! slow roast brisket hash. the brisket was good but wish it was slightly fattier. the hash browns are good but could be crispier. i would give the plate itself a  star. pancakes. my friend ended up ordering one of the pancakes with fruits. it looks pretty appealing on pictures but do not order if you are easily overwhelmed by sweets. that plate is so sweet, we could not take more than  bites per person. i would recommend getting their smallest pancake dish as a side or order pancakes with only a quarter of syrup. it was wayyyyyyyyyy too sweet."
926,Brian S.,1127,5,8/15/18,"my wife and i came here during our trip to chicago and this ended up being the best place we ate at in this foodie town. loved this place. first of  times we came here i got the waffle and fried chicken. now i am not really into this dish too much but this has been the first time that i really liked this dish! which says something about this one. the second dish i had on my second trip was the omelet and side pancake. was great and loved both dishes. were prepared just right and the service was friendly and prompt. side note  if you go here, the lines can get long so check in with the app to save your place in line and you can plan ahead and arrive at the suggested wait time."
927,Janette B.,1127,2,2/22/18,"i know i am going to get a lot of flack for saying this, but i am saying it, this place is a step up from denny's gasp! i had wildberry on my chicago radar, but could never justify the wait times anytime i was in town. i dragged my friend here as we were staying close by. i put my name on their no wait app & we lounged in our hotel room until it was close to our time. if you have ever been, you know how crazy hectic this restaurant is. hoards of patrons standing outside, inside, an entourage of waiters carrying pancake stacks yelling for the crowd to move. you have a certain expectation for a place based on the demand. i ordered a mexican skillet w a side of regular pancakes & coffee while my friend had a veggie omelet. the pancake was good & i guess what they are known for. the skillet was alright, a bit too cheesy, but tamed my hunger. i think this place is good for the millennium park hoards of tourists. i have learned my lesson."
928,Shikira J.,1127,5,7/15/18,"wildberry is the best breakfast i have had. it was well worth the . hour wait. you can add your name to the waitlist before arriving though. the service is excellent. our waiter was friendly, prompt, and attentive. we did not have to ask for a thing. he anticipated everything we would need and kept our drinks refilled even with the restaurant being so busy. i had the pancake, eggs, and chicken sausage. everything was delicious. the pancakes were super fluffy. i have never tasted pancakes so good. the eggs were perfectly made and the chicken sausage had great flavor. the portion sizes are good too. wildberry will be my go to when in the chicago area. this restaurant will not disappoint."
929,Avani P.,1127,4,7/23/18,"your typical breakfast place with a ridiculously long wait. the food is great and definitely worth the wait if you have time, but i would not wait in that line more than maybe once a year. we put our names down and took a walk around the park to kill the time while we waited. once seated our food came out very quickly, thank god. all the food is really good, but their sweet options are my personal favorites!"
930,Divyansh G.,1127,4,11/6/18,good vegan food selection! easy to get to from the bean atmosphere feels a bit like an ihop
931,Adi E.,1127,5,8/4/18,"returned  years later. still awesome! arrived at am and no wait. i had a breakfast burrito sub turkey bacon. i love that you can put other meats in it. it was awesome. everyone i was with loved their pancakes, omelettes, french toast specialhad wisconsin cherries. definitely recommend."
932,Lisa O.,1127,5,7/10/18,"i am so incredibly impressed. every second of our time spent here was wonderful. we walked in to  extremely friendly and attentive hostesses who quickly got us seated. our server was energetic and fun. the staff all seems like such a family that is having a good time, interacting with each other and the customers while providing excellent service. i am never seen such a happy and smooth restaurant staff. on top of that, the food was absolutely incredible. both of us decided it was the best french toastcrepes we have had. we both ordered 'berry bliss'. it is very, very sweet. it is covered in sauce and tons of berries. in the inside it has strawberry creme filling. i am generally not one to like stuff like this, but it is an exception. it was so good. i also ordered the cinnamon spice latte that was equally as good. they use intelligenista coffee. it was not too sweet, but just the right amount of milk and sugar and cinnamon to be very enjoyable. my whole experience here was so amazing. i want everyone to try this place. highly recommend!"
933,Caroline L.,1127,5,4/10/18,"i visited wildberry after both my sister and uncle who live in chicago told me it is the best breakfast place, and thought it was worth the hype! i was worried about the wait because of its popularity and since it was spring break, but i was there at  am on a tuesday and we only waited  minutes. the berry bliss pancakes had a generous helping of berries and the most delicious vanilla anglaise and marscapone topping. they were incredibly fluffy as well. the portion was huge i definitely got my money's worth. the service was extremely fast but i did not feel like i was being rushed even though it was busy. overall, i would highly recommend visiting, but try to go at an off time or use the waiting list feature! the pancakes were seriously the best pancakes of my life."
934,Lizzie P.,1127,4,2/10/18,"i know a lot people come here and complain about the wait time but..... pro tip add your name to the wait list through the yelp app! our air bnb was  minutes away from the restaurant so we added ourselves to the wait list while on the way there. we checked in with the hostess and only waited a total of five minutes before being seated. highly recommend you do this if you hate waiting. the restaurant itself is pretty big, so to have such a long wait, you can bet it is super packed! between the two of us, we ordered the signature berry bliss and the mexicana skillet. the pancakes were too sweet for me, but if you have a sweet tooth this item is perfect for you ^_^ pancakes come with berries, vanilla anglaise, blackberry coulis, and berry mascarpone. it is a huge serving so i recommend sharing with someone! hands down my favorite item was the mexicana skillet though. if i came back to the restaurant, i would probably order this item again. it comes with hash browns, cheddar & jack cheese, eggs, chorizo sausage, jalapeno, avocado, cilantro & onions. people who prefer savory dishes will like this option! overall, wildberry is a great place for affordable, decent brunch. sure, there are way better restaurants i have tried in chicago but they were also triple the price of this place. so if you are dining on a budget, come here. skip the ihop or mickey dee's breakfast."
935,Jun W.,1127,5,7/9/18,"by far, thee ultimate breakfast restaurant in chicago! oh my goodness gracious... please, order the signature berry bliss pancakes. try it and enjoy it! i seriously mean it. these pancakes are the fluffiest pancakes in the world. the texture and taste of the pancakes is surreal and cannot be replicated anywhere else. it is so worth the wait. depending on when you go, there can be a two hour wait. we reserve our spot in the virtual line through yelp. the check in app only appears during business hours. the estimated time on the line check in app is very accurate. so this will help you cut down on the wait time. p.s. come extra hungry. portions are extremely generous. p"
936,Setu J.,1127,4,7/7/18,i did not quite understand the fuzz and craze about this place. i mean the food was nice with big portions but not that great to justify the hours long wait. i was lucky to get a table on arrival since i had a larger group. this was  am on a sunday morning and people had queued up. the servers were courteous. they have an assembly line kinda efficiency to cater to the rush. i by no means disliked the food. i just do not get the hype. try going early. like  am.
937,Elizabeth D.,1127,5,10/19/18,the wait is long!! but it is honestly worth it! i am in town from las vegas!! the servers are quick very friendly!! i own a coffee shop in las vegas!! so i always try the lattes while out of town. to be honest the shots taste burnt to me. but over all the pumpkin flavor was amazing!! i would definitely come back again!!
938,Carol R.,1127,5,9/28/18,"i actually forgot that i had been here in my preyelp life until i saw my friend's review pop up on my newsfeed. i was there a little over a year ago, but i still remember what i had because it was so good  wildberry waffle with a side of turkey bacon. my idea of a perfect brunch  sweet and salty. i got the order to go and ate in the park."
939,Lawrence R.,1127,5,9/28/18,"went here because of the reviews...now i am adding to the reviews. wow. this place was incredible. make sure you put your name on the waiting list, the line is long. the mexican skillet and cinnamon roll pancakes were mind blowing. the food is prepared quickly for such a busy place and the waitstaff made some amazing recommendations. came here twice on a  day trip to chicago."
940,Kelly L.,1127,4,2/8/18,"the breakfast was delicious but not really sure if a  hour wait is worth it. i wish i had known earlier about the yelp check in earlier. we found out as we were heading out of our hotel so we had to kill time around the area. it was not fun having to wait, we were starving by the time we sat down. i got the butcher's block skillet with a side of cinnamon bun pancakes. hands down the best pancakes i have ever had. it was sooooo goood, i am drooling at the thought. it tasted just like a cinnamon bun with all the yummy goodness from pancakes. the butcher's block was huge and honestly i could have shared it with my husband because i could not finish it. my husband got the fig omelette, was not as good as mine. i thought it was weird but he enjoyed it. would come again for their pancakes but will make sure to put my name well in advance or come after the rush."
941,Sarah P.,1127,5,2/13/18,"i truly truly love this place. there is so much to love. everything on the menu is delicious and plentiful, the prices are amazing and for being how busy they are, the service is on point. the wait time sucks, but good things come to those who wait! and hey, you can put your name on the waitlist ahead of time! the options are there for you!! plus the turn around time is so fast because everyone here seems like they are good at their jobs. we got the cinnamon bun pancakes, the eggs benedict, the panini and a veggie&cheese bake. everything was fast, hot and delicious and the bill capped in at . not bad, not bad at all."
942,Maranda W.,1127,5,7/2/18,"this place was worth the waitif you do it correctly! yelp let us you put yourself on a waitlist as soon as they open as long as you can check in by a certain point. we woke up, but ourselves in the waitlist minutes were both able to shower and walk about  minutes from the loop. once we got there, we checked in and only had to wait another  minutes before being seated. highly suggested to do this! when we got there we saw the plaza packed with people waiting. we even had people go in front of us put their names on the list with a  hour wait! i got the barbacoa chilaquilas skillet with a a side of blueberry pancakes instead of toast. holy moly are the proportions huge. make sure you are hungry when you go! the skillet was delicious! way too big i took half of it home. all the ingredients were distributed really well so that i got bites that i got everything! the barbacoa was tender and seasoned well. will definitely come back here again."
943,Aaron W.,1127,5,9/27/18,"to say this place is amazing, would be an understatement. the only thing that would be nice, is if they would take a limited number of reservations. i came to this place  times over  days and i had to wait over  minutes each time i showed up. that said... it is still worth it thanks again aaron wernli"
944,Carol C.,1127,5,10/11/17,"thanks to fellow yelpers, i found this wonderful but busy breakfast spot right across millennium park. thanks to the feature on the yelp app, i was able to put myself on the waitlist, so that in the time it took me to walk over, my wait time was down to  minutes! delicious and filling portions. you can order a kid size of the berry bliss pancakes and a side of something to go with. i chose a side of corned beef hash. enough for  really. the coffee is intelligentsia, the service is attentive. my coffee was constantly topped. i plan to be back the next time in town!"
945,Anna B.,1127,5,4/22/18,"generous portions, delicious sides, and fantastic service. sunday brunch at am wait time was quoted around  minutes after putting our names on the yelp waitlist. it did not take as long as expected, so we happily took our seats! around  patio tables and two large rooms inside. food options are plentiful and service is fast! my sister and i each ordered an omelet i had the rutherford bacon, goat cheese, caramelized onions and spinach, she had the napa valley fig. huge and delicious each came with a side of fruit or hash browns and toast or pancakes. i had standard pancakes and fruit, my sister had wildberry pancakes up charge for specialty pancake and fruit. everything was perfect! their coffee was strong and rich. worth the wait, for sure. i still cannot believe the side of pancakes was so big! nom nom nom"
946,Analisa M.,1127,5,10/28/18,one of my favorite places to go! it is worth the wait. staff are all very nice and friendly! i have not had a bad experience here so far. portions are enough for what you pay for. they have delicious pancakes! you cannot go wrong with anything you order everything is great!
947,Lily C.,1127,4,10/15/17,delicious pancakes but i think imo the winner is the skillet!! its everything you want for breakfast on one plate! the price and portion is great too!my husband and i ordered the mexicana with the berry panckes extra . for speciality pancake and it was alot of food just for us two. i would def recommend just sharing an entree. another bonus is the delicious unlimited refill of their coffee. i would recommend this brunch place for anyone visiting chi town. tip sign up for the waitlist via yelp. when we got there it was a  hr wait if you did not!
948,David M.,1127,5,9/11/18,this place is wonderful great staff and even better food had the eggs benedict the ham was thick and tender and belgian waffles with signature berries. and definitely over ate
949,cynthia a.,1127,4,8/17/18,"i visited wild berry during my weekend vacation to chicago in early august. this place was recommended to me by a friend who sent me her picture of a huge stack of delicious looking pancakes. the restaurant was walking distance from my hotel on michigan ave in a corner area which i thought was difficult to find. the first morning i tried to eat was on a friday. wow! hour to hour and  minute wait. nope! are else where. the next morning saturday i realized you are able to add to the wait list through yelp! it tells you how the wait and to check in when you actually do reach the restaurant. got to use this method! upon my check in, i am told i still have a little wait, but no problem. as i am waiting for maybe  minutes, a waiter tells me he can seat me! i followed the other waiter who gave me a perfect corner outdoor seat. i had the huge stack of wild berry pancakes with a side of eggs with cheese. the eggs were delicious! the pancakes were awfully thick for my liking. not too sweet and yummy, but had a strong cakey texture. they are menu is big and looks good! definitely worth the checking out!"
950,Riley J.,1127,5,4/23/18,"get the pancakes. our meal here was amazing, absolutely everything was fantastic. the food was very filling, about average brunch prices, and so full of flavor. the oreo pancakes were hands down the best pancakes that i have ever had, and the berry was also seriously amazing. i would also like to highlight the location  wait time. you can put your name down online, which was extremely convenient given the long wait since this restaurant is very popular. also, it is right by the bean! not a bad way to kill time until your reservation. i cannot wait to come back to chicago for more!"
951,Jonathan R.,1127,5,6/14/18,amazing service and pancakes. you must get here. super fresh delicious fluffy etc. skillet was good too. coffee thumbs up. when in chicago get here!
952,Sam P.,1127,4,11/7/18,the pancakes are superb! i will be back soon! place is so relaxing.
953,Salena C.,1127,3,9/23/17,"i am not sold, you guys. the wait time really makes it seem like the hype is real, but is it really real? not in my opinion.... do not get me wrong. the food is not bad by any means. i ordered the napa valley fig omelette, which has scallions, figs, bacon and havarti, and i got my choice of fruit or hash browns, as well as my choice of pancakes or toast. it is a lot of food for . i even upgraded to the signature berry bliss pancakes. i liked everything. i enjoyed what i tasted. but it is just an omelette, and they are pretty standard pancakes with some cool anglaise designs. i much prefer my local hot spots for taste, service and wait time, but it is worth a try if you are really into hitting up all of the cool spots in chicago. for me though, it is one and done! checked it off to my to do list... forever!"
954,Daniel P.,1127,5,10/21/18,great spot overall. not sure it is worth the . plus hour wait. try it if you have the time if not walk over to eggys which is also amazing!
955,My-Lynn N.,1127,5,11/5/17,"if you want to eat here, come prepared for a long wait. we ended up waiting a little over an hour. luckily, millenium park is right next to it so we explored the park after putting our names on the list. unluckily, as chicago does, it poured and we were dripping wet when we returned to do our final leg of waiting outside. that being said, the service was very prompt and friendly once we were seated. i was impressed by how quickly everything was served once we ordered! the place was packed but we had our drinks and food before we knew it  and plenty of it at that. the food portions were hefty, which is great since waiting sure makes you hungry! hazelnut latte  nice flavor, i enjoyed that it was organic trade coffee beans. additionally, it was not too heavy on hazelnut flavor wild berry signature french toast  wow! it was very tasty. i usually go for more savory than sweet at breakfast places but i knew i had to try it. the fresh berries added were very good. the best part was the marscapone cheese with berry in between the slices of french toast. the glazes on it were great too"
956,Erica A.,1127,5,8/25/18,food is really good and service with the yelp waiting list is wonderful! make sure to check it out and sign into the wait list of the wait time on yelp is over  minutes. pancakes are really yummy. place is busy and kind of loud but breakfast is really yummy. highly recommend.
957,Abby B.,1127,3,3/27/18,"i met a friend at wildberry early on a weekday morning, and though it was a pleasant enough experience, i felt a little like i was at an ihop. the service was super attentive and quick, but the food was nothing special. i got the rustic egg panini, and my friend got the pancakes. i think we should have opted for their french toast or something more special. our food was just okay and by the time we left around am, there was an enormous line out the door. i would be bummed if i waited for longer than  minutes for the food we had."
958,Sophia D.,1127,5,3/27/18,"my boyfriend and i actually came here twice for our chicago trip. the food comes in huge portions and they are so delicious! i actually ordered a veggie burger but the patty was falling apart on me and i told the waitress. i ended up returning my order and receiving a turkey burger instead. the customer service was great the manager even came to apologize, which was not necessary. both times, the food was great and so was the service. i would definitely come back here and recommend it to anyone!"
959,Sylvia Y.,1127,4,11/14/17,"i wanted to hit up a breakfast spot close to millennium park and wildberry cafe was the place. i went on a weekday morning, and it was already busy inside at  am but the wait was only  minutes, so not that bad. as i expected, it was full of tourists and visitors from out of town. i was surprised by how clean it looked despite the heavy foot traffic i ordered eggs with bacon, side of fruit, and pancake. it came out fairly quickly. the bacon and pancake were definitely made in batches and did not come out piping hot, which was a bit of a bummer. everything tasted fine though, and even though it does not look like much, it was a lot of food. for the amount of food, it was a pretty solid deal. overall, it is pretty standard breakfast fare, nothing ultra mindblowing, and it is not like the pancakes can do jumping jacks or anything, but it is a solid spot, and met my expectations and then some. service was fast and friendly. i would recommend this spot to my familyfriends on their visits to chicago. ."
960,Ashley D.,1127,5,10/24/18,"i went here for breakfast with my boyfriend and had a great experience. we each got an omelet with a choice of pancake on side. the food was fantastic, but the portions are huge. we could have easily shared one order. tip get there early to put your name down on the waitlist"
961,Alexander M.,1127,4,10/6/18,food was great but the wait is looooooong!!!!! get there early or check in with an app. trust me it will save you time. service was very good.
962,Erin M.,1128,5,11/8/18,"this place is spot on! seriously, a must try! food we had the charred cauliflower to start, followed by the cavatelli, then the housemade bagel with steelhead trout, then the octopus a la plancha, then to finish with the croque signora! the octopus was what we came for but the croque signora was the best!! service our server was amazing! he was so friendly. super helpful in making decisions and providing great feedback. very knowledgeable and all around made our experience worth every penny!!"
963,Mandy C.,1128,3,11/7/18,"a ton of my friends recommended this restaurant so i decided to try it out. unfortunately, i was not too impressed with the food nor the ambiance. for starters, i had to wait about two hours for a table on a saturday night at pm. my friend and i were finally seated around pm a bit late to have dinner in my opinion but i thought this place would be worth it. unfortunately, even at pm the place was still packed so i was seated in a large communal table with a few other parties. space wise, the entire restaurant is very cramped and i barely felt like i had any personal space. food was decent, but not anything amazing. i ordered the bone marrow as well as the ribs dish. portions were pretty small. pricing was not too badnot super affordable, but not too expensive. i would not mind coming back, but this place is not worth the wait and is definitely overhyped."
964,Michael C.,1128,5,11/4/18,"the swine!!! why would you rave about the swine?! let alone a purple swine!! because it is absolutely delicious...duh!! prior to my chitown trip the suggestions kept pouring in about how the purple pig was a must visit...a ton of people i know were just raving about this place, for good reason! amazing deliciousness!! ~ crispy pig ears   did not realize it came with a fried egg on top. my server told me to mix it all up and eat it...so i took his advice. but first, i had to try a few of the crispy pig ears by themselves. amazing! i am not sure if this dish was suppose to be an appetizer or a main course. either way, i am just glad i ordered it...crispy, crunchy, flavorful...fried!!! there is nothing bad about this dish! ~ milk braised berkshire shoulder   another absolutely amazing dish! tell tale sign...this was something special it was served with a spoon! no knife!!! my thoughts at the time a piece of pork shoulder on the bone served with a spoon?! hmmm...are they nuts?! where is my knife?! did they make a mistake? nope. nope. nope. they got it right! the meat is so tender, it just falls of the bone...no knife required! the pork was just perfect! tender, juicy, full of flavor, complemented brilliantly with the lentils & mashed potatoes. i could find no fault...just wish there was more. #lifeofafatty i will endeavor to stop by here every time i am in chitown! brilliant!"
965,Cindy Z.,1128,4,11/4/18,"this was my first meal after landing in chicago. my friends and i came by on a saturday for brunch. we placed our name, walked around, and was called to our table in a little over an hour. luckily since the purple pig is so centrally located, we were able to walk around and explore the city during that time. the restaurant is crowded with a lot of communal tables. the familyknit atmosphere follows with the familystyle of sharing multiple dishes though. between the four of us, we shared  dishes, which was the perfect amount. my favorites had to be the milk braised pork shoulder  and chicken thigh kebabs . the pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and just fell off the bone. the tenderness of the meat paired so smoothly with the pureed mashed potatoes for this divine consistency. as for the chicken kebabs, they came in huge pieces grilled on a skewer on top of beautifully roasted potatoes. the potatoes were so crispy, yet soft that just made every bite so heavenly. i would definitely get these two dishes again. we also ordered the crispy pig's ears , which is one of their most popular dishes. it comes topped with a sunnyside egg to mixed into the crispy pig ears and veggies. this was a nice dish with a sour twist, but did not stand out as much to me. the grilled broccoli  was a very unique take of the vegetable with a crispy yet creamy texture in a hint of sour taste as well. this was a favorite amongst our table. our last two dishes were the olive oil poached tuna  and stuffed squid . the tuna was so vividly colorful in a beautiful presentation from the purple potatoes, green beans, red peppers, yellow quail eggs, and of course the pink tuna. this was a fun and tasteful dish to try! now although the squid was good, it came with only  pieces. it was also stuffed, so made splitting between  people a bit of a mess. overall, delicious and unique spot on various types of menu items. even though i am not the biggest fan of tapas, i would still recommend coming here and living its hype. i would definitely be back for their meat menu items though, especially that pork shoulder!"
966,Greg G.,1128,5,10/31/18,"i think this is my rd visit here  and it was definitely my favorite visit! maybe it is because we had expert guides with us this time  so we were stuffing our faces in chicago and did not have space for the charcuterie and cheese... but next time right? we went with the fancy egg muffin so good!, the whipped feta fancy looking!, the broccoli nothing special here, and the braised pork shoulder terrific!. simply put, everything was super good  and cannot wait to come back "
967,Haru Y.,1128,5,10/31/18,"was not sure if this place was a tourist trap or actually had legit food! stopped in on a monday afternoon around  pm. it was bustling with tourists but we were able to be seated right away with a party of two. we went for a few of the yelp highlights bone marrow, octopus and pork shoulder. the food did not disappoint!! the bone marrow was a generous portion with a side of perfectly toasted bread, herbs and capers and salt. they even provided us with extra bread after we ran out! the octopus was perfectly cooked with a soft texture on the inside and slight char on the outside. it was served with green beans tossed in a pesto sauce. the pork shoulder was amazing! the pork was incredibly soft and tender and just fell apart as we ate it. it was served on top of the creamiest mashed potatoes! overall a solid choice but definitely popular with tourists, but for good reason."
968,Roz B.,1128,5,10/30/18,"wow. all i can say is wow. everything here we had was amazing. salmon  incredibly moist and flavorful. larger than anticipated based on the price. salted beets  huge portion and the best thing we had. the whipped goat cheese is so delicate and light yet incredibly flavorful. broccoli  my least favorite, but still amazing. a rendition of cheesy broccoli steak  unfortunately do not recall the name, but it was melt in your mouth good a few notes do not take reservations. we were there at pm on a monday and did not have a problem. they were full at pm.  communal tables  huge wine selection,  and  oz pours  create their own soda water"
969,Esther K.,1128,5,10/29/18,"could not wait to try this place when we visited chicago. we tried several dishes and none of them disappointed bone marrow very smooth and decadent. beef tendon chips probably our least favorite dish, but still good. very crispy. gnocchi with oxtail ragu best dish. hands down. could have eaten three of these. grilled octopus amazing. cannot wait to go back!"
970,Delia S.,1128,5,11/5/18,"once in awhile you find food nirvana. this place was recommended by a foodie friend and i only wish i would come here with more people because i wanted to try everything! to make matters worse, i sat at the pass bar and watched, in wonder at the symphony of movement and timing as five quick as lightning staff members, under the baton of the lead, moved deftly to compose each plate. one seasoning, handing it off to the grilled, another checking each bone of marrow, as another painted flavor and color across a plate. a final inspection by the lead just as a server swept by to take it to an eagerly awaiting patron. each dish, more tempting than the last. each person, more impressive in organization, skill and presentation. i highly recommend. bring friends, order everything, and enjoy!"
971,Mary S.,1128,5,10/25/18,"been meaning to get to this place for quite a while now! we were seeing a show at house of blues and decided that we would go early and see if we could snag a seat at the bar which definitely worked in our favor! i got there at about  and it was quickly filling up. when i walked in there were about  empty seats at the bar. i made a beeline and sat down, was greeted quickly by the bartender, cannot remember his name but he provided great service! he was very knowledgeable about drinks, recommendations, and ingredients. we started off with the soprassata and a cheese that i cannot even remember now but it was very bold and very funky! great flavor tho! we ordered the crispy pig ears, salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette, and huevos rotas con chorizo! we also got a steak dish that was good but i did not get a pic and the name of it escapes me now. but everything was so good! i could not stop eating the beets and i wish i had more people so that i could try more things! we will definitely be back. oh, great drink menu as well. tons of selections on all liquors and wine."
972,Richard D.,1128,5,11/6/18,"you know when you enter a place and the line is packed inside and out that you are going to experience something amazing! well this tapas place was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had. needless to say everything tasted fresh and every plate made was beautiful! i decided to try the grilled octopus, seafood saganaki, jamon dish and the chilled calamari! every single one of these dishes were flavorful, tasty and just outright amazing! i also want to say the grilled octopus's was out of this world! perfectly made, tender and just outright tasty!"
973,Michelle K.,1128,5,10/16/18,"in the  nights that we stayed in chicago, purple pig was by far our favorite meal! we got seated right away at a community table. neither of us have any problems sitting with others and we angled our chairs to keep to ourselves anyways. we started our meal with some local beers and the olive appetizer. oh, em, gee. the olives were warmedcharred with shaved celery, a mustard type sauce and grilled bread. we both were just in awe of how delicious these olives were. we knew right away we were going to love everything on the menu. we had such a hard time choosing what we wanted next. the octopus, the panini, the cheese boards all sounded so heavenly. we ended up going with creating our own charcuterie plate. we opted for a smoked goat cheese, a sharp cheddar, and then we let the waiter pick our third. we got two meats that included duck prosciutto & air cured beef. it came with a few accompaniments like olives, and spreads. we both loved it and it was the perfect portion for the two of us to share. i think we could have sat here and ate all night trying everything on the menu but we had plans that we had to get to. yes it is pricey, but the food quality is worth the price you are paying. the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and quick. i was in love with this place."
974,Daniel A.,1128,4,10/20/18,"the purple pig was my favourite food experience in chicago! despite the hourlong wait to get seated, it turned out to be worthwhile. myself and a couple others shared  plates, which filled us up! ranked in order from best to worse, we tried bone marrow, octopus, pig ears, neck bone gravy, and sausage. the first two were to die for but you could probably skip the latter . also, space was really, really tight."
975,Fifi C.,1128,4,10/16/18,"five stars for the food,  stars for the service and  stars for ambiance. we came on a sunday evening around  and it took  minutes to get a table for . we are seated in the patio and at a big communal table. we are seated close to other guests and barely have any elbow room. the noise level is very high in the restaurant. it is very loud and it is not a place to have a nice quiet dinner and chat. our friendly server took our order and the food came in a reasonable time. we ordered the grilled cuttlefish, pork and charred cauliflower. all of the are delicious and impressively flavorful with nice combination of teton each dish. the cuttlefish was grilled perfectly and the charcoal bread added a nice sweetness to the dish. the coppa pork was cooked perfectly and greatly seasoned. the shishito peppers, lentil and pomegranate gave a nice flavor and texture to the dish. the cauliflower dish are delicious as well. it is tangy with a hint of charred flavor."
976,Mitesh S.,1128,5,11/4/18,"definitely a  star meal. they do not take reservations, but you can track your progress on the waitlist via yelp, which is quite helpful. it took about  mins to get a table for two this past saturday night, and it was totally worth it. i ordered a rye whiskey cocktail off the original cocktails list, and it was delicious. our waiter provided excellent service. he recommended  plates between the two of us. we were super hungry, and ordered  plates, which was probably a bit excessive.  we ordered the following . cornbread . beet salad . pasta with octopusred sauce . chicken thigh kabobs and potatoes . cuttle fish with red pepper aioli the kabobs were likely our least favorite, but still quite tasty. everything else was exceptional. definitely recommend this place, despite the wait time!"
977,Audrey K.,1128,4,9/27/18,"probably one of the more upscale places i would not have imagined going to. i came across this place a few days before my friend and i took our trip to chicago. it ended up becoming one of her friend's recommendations for must try places. so, one nigh we decided to just go for it since we were in the area. the wait time for a table of two was about an hour. to kill some time, we ended up walking around before indulging. we got seated promptly and the atmosphere was dimmed, but made it feel like a very lively outting in. the waitress let me sample  different types of wine just to figure out my preference and she was more than accommodating in helping me select the right one. we got the corn mash to start and it was so flavorful! the portion was a good amount for two ladies to share. then, we got talked into ordering the duck. this was a dish i did not intend on ordering but the server said that they braise it for dayshours. i guess we could not say no. haha. it ended up being amazing. there were giant pieces of duck meat, unlike many other places that have ducks with more skin than meat. you put it in a fluffy bun and the white sauce on the side really compliment the entire entree. it is a mix of fun and umami flavors all together. finally, we had the bone marrow because that was the most ordered item around. i have never had bone marrow before, so i had a high expectation for this. it was huge!! very fatty tasting, but it did not make me feel greasy. so that was great. slap it on the crunchy soft side bread and top it with cilantro, and well enjoy! definitely on the pricier side, but a good type of pricey and i would say it was worth it."
978,Priscilla R.,1128,5,9/30/18,"was visiting chicago, my favorite city, for a bachelorette weekend. amongst the funfilled events of complete debauchery i had to carve out sometime to eat at a resturant i have wanted to eat at for sometime now but have never had the chance during my former business trips to chitown. located at the center of the magnificent mile, the purple pig is a must visit. it is small and you might find yourself sharing a table with strangers but if you are open minded it really is a cool vibe and totally worth getting aquinted to new people. i got lucky and was able to get seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen where all the magic happens. being able to watch the team put the flavorful plates together was an added bonus to my experience. voted one of america's best restaurants in  the purple pig exceeded my expectations. my party of two ordered the smashed potatoes, octopus a la plancha and the turkey leg confit. please note the plates are meant to be shared and omg it was more than enough food. let us just say each plate just got better as they came. it was as if my friend and i were making music with our yums and oh's and ah's and wow's of how delicious everything was. minimal talking was had as we were too busy stuffing our faces with such deliciousness! i was still a little hungover from the night before and had a flight to catch so i chose not to have a hair of the dog but they have an extensive wine list that i will absolutely try the next time i am in town. i will certainly be back! if you are looking for delicious reasonably priced food and a good time with awesome service, you must try the purple pig. one of my all time favorite restaurants in chitown."
979,Rolo C.,1128,5,10/9/18,"came here for a late lunch on a tuesday afternoon. sat at the bar and received fantastic service from bartender ryan, who recently moved from denver to chicago. i had the our purple pig pilsner on draft. they seem to be mostly wine focused, and their list is huge. i tried the roasted bone marrow, which came with some really good toast and a mostly parsley salad and coarse salt. rich and decadent just like bone marrow should be. then i told ryan i wanted to finish off with something light and refreshing, and he immediately recommended the caprese salad. this salad is awesome, and i liked all three main ingredients equally. the fresh buffalo mozzarella was perfect, the heirloom cherry tomatoes flavorful, and the charred onion vinaigrette zingy and great. the space is crowded and busy, as i expected it to be. perfect place to come as a party of one or two."
980,Charlene M.,1128,3,10/11/18,"i was expecting to have a better experience at the purple pig. i would give a  and a half for the food, a  for the space as well as for the service. our server was not patient and was not helpful either when we were asking questions about the dishes. the space is too tight, it seems like they try to squeeze as many people as possible in one table. plus you have everybody bumping into you during your meal. and it is very noisy. definitely not my favorite atmosphere. the cool thing is that you share your table with other guests. portions are meant to be shared, if you like that you will enjoy your meal. dishes come to you as soon as they are ready, which i enjoyed. ingredients used are fresh, and the flavors in general are very good. i got the grilled octopus one of the most popular dish, the roasted beets which were great, the salmon crudo and the passion fruit ice cream which was actually kind of salty, surprisingly. everything was really good food wise, but i just did not enjoy my time there. i am happy we did not had to wait an hour to get our table though, i would have thought it is not worth it"
981,Jennifer N.,1128,2,11/8/18,"i am really disappointed! this place has such great reviews. but  there are so many buts. first was the limited table space as most of the restaurant is shared table seating with other diners. we ordered one cheese and two meats that came with crackers, pickles and almondhoney spread that was just okay  how could you possibly mess up a meat and cheese plate right? my only complaint on the cheese was that the piece of cheese we were served had a side of it that must have been uncovered or something because it was dried out and hard to eat. we ordered seafood saganaki and milk braised pork with mashed potatoes for our main meals  both of them were unimpressive and super salty. the toasted bread was the best thing from our main meals. one star for the okay meat and cheese plate, another star for the large winebeerliquor menu. otherwise...it was not worth it. at all."
982,Cindy Z.,1128,4,11/4/18,"this was my first meal after landing in chicago. my friends and i came by on a saturday for brunch. we placed our name, walked around, and was called to our table in a little over an hour. luckily since the purple pig is so centrally located, we were able to walk around and explore the city during that time. the restaurant is crowded with a lot of communal tables. the familyknit atmosphere follows with the familystyle of sharing multiple dishes though. between the four of us, we shared  dishes, which was the perfect amount. my favorites had to be the milk braised pork shoulder  and chicken thigh kebabs . the pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and just fell off the bone. the tenderness of the meat paired so smoothly with the pureed mashed potatoes for this divine consistency. as for the chicken kebabs, they came in huge pieces grilled on a skewer on top of beautifully roasted potatoes. the potatoes were so crispy, yet soft that just made every bite so heavenly. i would definitely get these two dishes again. we also ordered the crispy pig's ears , which is one of their most popular dishes. it comes topped with a sunnyside egg to mixed into the crispy pig ears and veggies. this was a nice dish with a sour twist, but did not stand out as much to me. the grilled broccoli  was a very unique take of the vegetable with a crispy yet creamy texture in a hint of sour taste as well. this was a favorite amongst our table. our last two dishes were the olive oil poached tuna  and stuffed squid . the tuna was so vividly colorful in a beautiful presentation from the purple potatoes, green beans, red peppers, yellow quail eggs, and of course the pink tuna. this was a fun and tasteful dish to try! now although the squid was good, it came with only  pieces. it was also stuffed, so made splitting between  people a bit of a mess. overall, delicious and unique spot on various types of menu items. even though i am not the biggest fan of tapas, i would still recommend coming here and living its hype. i would definitely be back for their meat menu items though, especially that pork shoulder !"
983,Simon N.,1128,5,10/20/18,"ambiance the purple pig is right at the hotbed of michigan avenue. do some sight seeing and shopping and then head to one's reservation. one may be waiting outside as the inside is pretty tight quarters inside. it is a very intimate restaurant and be ready for a lot of general background noise given how much traffic they get. food very cool tapas style dishes. we love everything we ate. the portion sizes are very generous for tapas. dishes pigs ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried eggs crispy like it is fried food. salt and vinegar beef tendon chips tastes like a pork rind, salty and vinegary chicken thigh kabobs sauce is amazing. the thighs are crispy and tender. the potatoes are similar to potatoe wedges. octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde chewy octopus tastes very fresh. potatoes finished nicely on the side. green beans are salty and cooked to my liking. milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes fall off meat, some saltiness, pot roast taste sicilian iris fried donuts. tastes like a beignet. service the service is pretty good. they sat us when they had availability and were attentive the whole time."
984,Jen B.,1128,5,10/9/18,guys this place was really as incredible as everyone says. i am a little skeptical when somewhere has this many reviews with such high ratings but i can honestly say it was one of the best meals i have had. the waiter was wonderful at making recommendations and we just ordered what he said. we had  plates total which was perfect for just the two of us. that chicken bolognese pasta is not to be forgotten and the way the milk braised pork shoulder completely melted in my mouth was amazing. this place deserves all the stars. cannot wait to go back!
985,Jocelyn X.,1128,5,9/29/18,"finally tried this place and it was very very good. i did my best to finish the milk braised pork shoulder and octopus with fingering potatoes and salsa verde. so delicious, no regrets!!"
986,Bryan C.,1128,4,9/23/18,"very good, but be prepared to wait. my friend came by and put our names down first, and even on a monday night, there was a hour wait at pm. i came with one other person, but i would recommend coming here with at least  people. the dishes are all small portions, so coming with a bigger groups allow you to try more dishes without breaking the bank too much. food octopus a la plancha, milk braised pork shoulder and chicken thigh kebabs drinks colombian old fashioned  which was bomb! i think my favorite was probably the octopus, it was super flavorful  not too chewy or tough. i heard you cannot go wrong with anything you ordered, so i definitely want to come back and try other dishes!"
987,Valerie C.,1128,4,9/10/18,"adam is the best!!!!!!! had an unmemorable experience with the hostess but adam made everything ! had a short  min squeeze in between checking out of my hotel  checking in for a flight at midway. just had to check out purple pig. arrived shortly after am on a tuesday, promptly seated and was on my way by pm  now that is efficiency! the dishes made its way out of their kitchen at lightning speed. at  the entire place was sufficiently packed. i ordered the pig's ear decent but would pass next time, the milk braised pork shoulder amazing and the octopus my fave!.  dishes were perfect for two of us  in fact the portions are on the larger side. topped it off with a glass of chards. perfect last meal in chi  thanks purple pig!!"
988,D V.,1128,4,9/8/18,"this was one crazy loud, frenetic, unusual, delicious restaurant! we stopped in early  for some food before seeing hamilton fantastic  lived up to all the hype. it was early but quite busy. there is lots of different seating arrangements high tables, communal tables and regular tables  both inside and out. they seated us at a huge high communal table with bar stools with backs so they were comfortable. not much room for wait staff to squeeze between tables so i was often bumped but it was fine. the menu is quite unusual  descriptions are rather vague and there is no way to tell portion size which made ordering tricky. the waiter was pleasant enough but light on the details when we inquired. he said items were tapas size and so we ordered a bit more but most of the items were def larger than tapas size. but oh well, the food was delicious. we ordered a calamari dish it was kinda like a cold salad with calamari, couscous and chopped up vegetables  very good. we had a pigs feet and pheasant dish  also delicious. we got a cheesemeat board which was wonderful you select whatever numberkind of meat and cheese you would like. also got the milk braised pork shoulder over mashed potatoes  that was everyone's favorite. also had the bbq ribs  delicious. the only dish that was not stellar was the fried chicken drumsticks. was not bad, just not great. any way, the place is loud and crazy busy but lots of fun and delicious. it is kinda expensive but not unreasonable  for  of us probably in line with chicago prices and the quality and dinning experience were top notch. do not go here if you are looking for a quiet night but do go to enjoy unusual, delicious food in a jubilant setting."
989,Howard L.,1128,4,8/31/18,"this is a hopping and popular place for sure. we happened to be touring in the area at the right time, so we gave them a try. we had no wait at pm on a friday but there were not a lot of spots left at the communal tables. the place opens at am, and there is always a line i am told.  wife and i ordered the seafood saganaki  and milk braised pork shoulder , and we shared them family style as we often do. i enjoyed the flavors of both dishes, and particularly liked the tender and succulent pork shoulder . as far as the saganaki, the mussels were on tiny side, and wife thought the seafood could have been fresher, and also found a meatless shrimp tail piece which set her back a bit on the kitchen quality.  service was quick and top notch. the venue was crowded, tight, and loud. overall, it is one of those hip places that is nice to try once, and a place to show off chicago to tourists and visitors, but we do not feel compelled to revisit."
990,Grace C.,1128,4,8/24/18,"be prepared to wait in line! i went on a saturday ~pm, and waited for an hour. but the food made it well worth it! the service was great as well. we started out with the meatballs, and the combination between the meat, sauce, and garnishes were amazing. though it was pricey, it felt nice to treat myself with these. i would not come here regularly, though the octopus pasta was delicious as well, but my personal favorite was the milk braised pork . the meat was very tender and the added on mashed potatoes all melted in your mouth.  these three dishes were shared between  people, and we left feeling satisfied."
991,Ally K.,1128,5,8/18/18,"words cannot describe the euphoric experience that is the purple pig. just go go go!!! i admit i am a little biased because mediterranean style tapas are kind of my jam, but i digress. particularly memorable dishes include the sicilian iris, the octopus a la plancha, and especially the polenta with ricotta and passion fruit. the braised pork shoulder was so unbelievably tender i was a bit skeptical if it was really pork shoulder ....ha! unlike most tapas places, the dishes are large enough that you will not feel like you are fighting with your group for more than a tiny bite from each dish. i went home with a full satisfied belly. win!!! lastly we got a great recommendation from our waitress on some red wine. the easy day drinking variety, perfect for our sunday brunch, and a new favorite, despite being one of the cheapest on the menu i will say that here you will find most bottles priced at over  dollars....mehhh. but! you can tell they put a lot of thought into the wine at purple pig, our red was served slightly chilled which i have learned over the years is the proper way to serve a bottle of red, but most restaurants just do not do this. all in all, if my review and the thousands of others have not convinced you yet, just please eat here. you will not regret it!"
992,Et-Mai N.,1128,5,8/17/18,"love this place ! what was good is the milk braised pork shoulder . it was brilliant ! also, the turkey leg was really good. one dish that was only ok was the blade steak. for us, it was a little bit too salty, but the staff were more than willing to change it for us. highly recommend this place!"
993,Mindy P.,1128,5,8/9/18,"the purple pig definitely met my high expectations! we came on a tuesday evening, hoping that our wait would not be too long, and low and behold, our wait time was only  minutes. located on the bustling shopping area on michigan ave, the purple pig is hard to miss. they do not take reservations, so if you want to beat the crowd, plan to arrive at odd hours or weekday evenings. the restaurant itself is a tight space with lots and lots of people. their drinks list is a extensive and i was impressed by their offerings. from what we were told by our server, their menu changes very often. we decided to go with our server's suggestions, and we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder , the octopus, and the ribs. food comes out incredibly fast. it literally felt like we had just ordered when our dishes came out. let me start off with the milk braised pork shoulder . the meat was super soft and literally melted in my mouth. it came with mashed potatoes and i cannot stop thinking about how the combination was the perfect match! now, the octopus was what blew me away. it was tender and soft and cooked to perfection. the consistency of the meat was mindboggling since my experience with octopus has always been super chewy, but this was not the case! finally, the ribs were just what i had thought they would be... amazing! the meat fell off the bones with just a little tap of my knife and fork. the sauce was tangy and not too sweet. i wish i could have tried other dishes, but honestly, that felt enough for the two of us. for a restaurant of this caliber, one would expect the price to be high. it was totally fine worth the experience and we left with happy tummies!"
994,Thuy H.,1128,3,8/7/18,"this place did not wow me like i was hoping it would after reading the reviews and seeing the photos. the wait was long so make sure you either go on off peak times or be prepared to wait. they do text you though so you can get in a little site seeing while waiting for your table. now, onto the food... turkey leg  massive! make sure you are with a large party if you plan on ordering this. if you love extremely salty, this is your dish. although i do love salt, i felt this dish was beyond salty and was only able to eat a few bites before calling it quits milk braised pork shoulder  this was the first dish that came out and by far the best this we ate. extremely flavorful. it was so good that i was excited for everything else, but then was let down. octopus cavetelli  very peppery. my kids were not able to eat this as they thought it was too spicy grilled octopus  the lemon really over powered this. it was so sour! the octopus itself was cooked really well though. it had a nice char and was very tender. although the decor and service was amazing, i really did not think the wait was worth it. the menu is large though, so maybe i just ordered completely wrong"
995,Lena V.,1128,5,7/30/18,"i had so many recommendations from friends to come here so i had to see what the hype was all about. my boyfriend and i were not that hungry yet but knew that it was going to be a  hour wait so we walked down here to put our name and number down and went to go explore downtown and grabbed some pre dinner drinks. i leaned on yelp to tell me what to order and it did not disappoint! i ordered the bone marrow, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder , and crispy pig ears. the bone marrow was ginormous but it was the best bone marrow either one of us had ever tried. we needed more bread to finish the bone marrow! it was so simple but so delicious. everything was just so equally delicious and unique in it is own way. the octopus was the best we ever had also. it was not tough or chewy at all. the milk braised pork shoulder was so tender that we were only given a spoon to cut through it. the crispy pig ears were nicely fried and was packed with flavor. this is a definite must visit when in chicago."
996,Priscilla Y.,1128,5,7/15/18,"the wait was worth it!!! out here in the windy city for a work event, and came here to grab dinner. everything was delicious, waiter was very attentive. we got the octopus, peas, broccoli, braised pork shoulder and secreto. everything was very delicious! flavors were very balanced. nothing over powering another flavor. the portions are meant for family style, sharing.  dishes,  people. but be prepared to wait. so, grab a drink, wait, and enjoy!"
997,Joseph B.,1128,5,7/9/18,"shortest reviews are the best reviews. why? because there is no complaints... we are in town for the weekend and the purple sign caught our eye. the wait was not bad, and if i had to wait longer it would be worth it. because the food was prepared, presented and hit every taste bud you would imagine. service was beyond amazing, you can see they take equal care in their customers, and their staff. the vibes in this place reflect the vibes of the chicago streets, so be prepared to make a friend or two while your here. if it is still on the lunch menu when you go in try the pig ears, braised pork shoulder , roasted butternut squash and the charred broccoli. muah. amazing. only complaint was i wish i could stay for dinner."
998,Brendan E.,1128,5,7/8/18,"excellent, we got lucky and grabbed a seat at the bar during the dinner rush. had a trio of cheeses, milk braised pork shoulder and the bronzino. this place definitely lives up to the hype! excellent food, service, wine, and quite reasonably priced! well done!"
999,Rich M.,1128,5,7/8/18,"one of the best meals i have had in years. hands down. unbelievable food. great drink options. fantastic service. my wife travels to chicago for business on a regular basis. this restaurant has been on her list. i am so glad we took the time. we arrived at the purple pig at slightly before  on a saturday afternoon. the restaurant was full which, to me, is always a great sign early afternoon. we put our name on the waiting list and sat down outside. we had barely sat when a very helpful server alexander offered us cocktails. of course we obliged. both of our choices were expertly crafted. we were off to a good start. after an approximately  minute wait we sat down at a small table inside. just walking from the front door to our table exposed us to dozens of mouthwatering plates. we ordered another round of drinks and decided to start with a combination of meats and cheeses. for meat we went with blood mortadella, lingua and the salumi. for cheese we went with the grayson, a french triple creme and another that escapes me. we paired this with the marcona almonds in honey. everything was simply superb. we then had the crispy pigs ears. the pig is sliced thin and long and mixed with kale, peppers and topped with a fried egg. it is salty, crunchy, savory and everything that is right with the world. we then had the grilled octopus. while this was my least favorite item, it was still quite good. the octopus is prepared with fingerling potatoes and green beans with a salsa verde. for me this was a texture thing. most cooked octopus that i have had is charred, while this was seemingly sauteed. after switching to glasses of wine we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder . dear sweet baby jesus is this fantastic. the pork was preposterously tender  we barely touched it and it fell apart. had it been more socially acceptable, i would have licked the plate. utter perfection. overall it was an outstanding meal. i look forward to returning soon."
1000,Clement C.,1128,4,7/8/18,"reading about how long the wait could be, we decided to have an early dinner and arrived at the purple pig at  pm and were seated immediately. despite the waiter mentioned their dishes were tapas style and meant to be shared, the portion size is not what you may think about tapas. we ordered hummus, grilled broccoli, deviled egg, roasted cauliflower, seafood saganaki and braised pork shoulder . they were all good but we preferred the veggies dishes which were all quite unique over the seafood and the pork . the seafood saganaki was similar to bouillabaisse or cioppino in a tomato based sauce with saganaki cheese cubes, not too special. the braised pork was a little dry. the place was definitely busy and service was good. it is definitely worth a try."
1001,Rolo C.,1128,5,10/9/18,"came here for a late lunch on a tuesday afternoon. sat at the bar and received fantastic service from bartender ryan, who recently moved from denver to chicago. i had the our purple pig pilsner on draft. they seem to be mostly wine focused, and their list is huge. i tried the roasted bone marrow , which came with some really good toast and a mostly parsley salad and coarse salt. rich and decadent just like bone marrow should be. then i told ryan i wanted to finish off with something light and refreshing, and he immediately recommended the caprese salad. this salad is awesome, and i liked all three main ingredients equally. the fresh buffalo mozzarella was perfect, the heirloom cherry tomatoes flavorful, and the charred onion vinaigrette zingy and great. the space is crowded and busy, as i expected it to be. perfect place to come as a party of one or two."
1002,Stella W.,1128,4,8/12/18,"overall very worth the hype! food is creative and generally good, although the ambiance and service could use a little improvement. we were lucky to be seated right away at  pm on a wednesday. although the place is packed, inside the little room and on the patio. the overall turnout of food and service was not too slow at all. food all of their dishes are going extreme. they are great creative and tasty ones, do not take me wrong. but their spice use and flavor level is very extreme. like the chilled calamari, the calamari itself was so salty that your tongue would go numb for a few seconds if you have  bites in a row. so does the eggplant caponata, the mixture of sourness and sweetness is the only thing you can taste of the bite. you cannot even tell there are eggplants there. roasted bone marrow , same thing. it is like eating warm fat. it is like, the cooks punch you with the pure flavors in the face. i would appreciate if i can taste some of the textures of food more with lighter flavors. service the lady at the front door was very cold and unwelcoming. so does our waitress. you can tell that they are busy and trying to juggle with all the people they have to serve. but come on, at least try to pretend you mean it when you ask how is everything, instead of dropping the question then leave. but the manager, i believe, is very attentive and nice. they have an extensive drinking menu. so if you like spirits and wine, you would for sure appreciate their  something page drinking menu. overall a good place to eat and give it a try, but is it worth  hours of wait? i do not think so."
1003,Yoona K.,1128,3,8/7/18,"with , reviews and a  rating i thought my experience at the purple pig would be much more satisfying than it turned out to be. do not get me wrong my meal was good, but it is not worth it to wait for a long time since they do not take reservations. if i lived in chicago and recommending friends on where to eat in a short amount of time, this would not be in the top  places to eat... the place is super cramped everywhere. we walked in around pm on a weekday and got seated in ish minutes. they have several large communal tables, seating at the bar, and regular tables. we got seated in front of the kitchen areabar because those were the only seats left. pretty cramped and loud but it was fun to see the chefs making the food. my friend and i ordered  cocktails off of the menu. she ordered a basic old fashioned and i ordered a house cocktail cannot remember the name of it but it was vodka based. our drinks were pretty standard in taste, and the presentation was nice but one of the main reasons why i gave the purple pig  is that if i am paying  for a drink i expect more than half of my glassware to have liquid in it. the large ice cube they put in my cocktail literally made up half of my drink see picture. i was pretty shocked because i have never ordered a cocktail where most of it was just pure ice. the menu changes pretty often and i believe the menu i ordered off of back in june has already changed most of the dishes are 'tapas style' so the waiter recommended we ordered  dishes each. we ordered the roasted bone marrow . one of my friends favorite dishes and she said this was just standard but the portion was very large, roasted pineapple  pretty interesting flavors, asparagus  the best thing i ate here, it tasted like pasta but the whole dish was just tiny cut up asparagus, and the milk braised berkshire shoulder  the meat melted in your mouth and the mashed potatoes were delicious."
1004,Myra L.,1128,5,8/3/18,busy and noisy but the food is delicious. if i lived in chicago i would want to stop in at least twice a week. excellent wine and cocktail menu and great service. i strongly recommend the stuffed crispy octopus served over the tastiest green beans tossed in a lemon infused green herb sauce that is so tasty you want to use a spoon to scoop every drop. roasted bone marrow is a must appetizer as well as the scallops served in a fabulous light cream sauce and tantalizing garnishes. the homemade sorbets are creamy smooth and full of fresh strawberry flavor. i splurged on the calorie count and ordered the greek donuts which were a light and fluffy accompaniment with the strawberry sorbet.
1005,Dr. Scott C.,1128,5,7/22/18,"the purple pig is a hidden gem in chicago! i was definitely wowed by the ultimate explosion of flavors provided by this tapas restaurant. i was in a party of  and we came for lunch on saturday after , so we knew we would be waiting for a table. hostess was very polite told us probably a  min wait and she took my mobile # down for text alert when our table is ready. now this restaurant is set up with indoor and outdoor seating and we took the st available. you must know that this is set up with a mix of community style seating and regular tables but they are all very close together and if you are uncomfortable with that this may not be your gig. our group had no problem with this. since there were  of us we decided to order  plates to start with and decided later if we needed more to satisfy everyone. now our waiter explained to us that the food will come out of the kitchen as it is ready so they are not going to hold food and bring all  plates at once. perfectly fine with our group being that we have been to other tapas restaurants that do the same. i am glad he explained that to us on the front end as well. so we ordered bobota greek cornbread which had feta and mizithra cheeses and honey drizzled on the plate. wow this cornbread is to die for and this southern boy loved it!! it is so moist and both cheeses balance out that sweetness from the cornbread and honey. roasted cauliflower with sliced pickles was delicious and refreshing. i am not a cauliflower lover at all but i was convinced to try it and i found a new appreciation for it and enjoyed it. this cauliflower preparation was different than any other i had before, thin sliced with small thinly sliced pickles all roasted together. very enjoyable my hats off to the chef!! roasted bone marrow was amazing!! the chef has this preparation down to a science! using the toasted bread and layering the roasted bone marrow and sprinkle on the sicilian sea salt and then place the herb salad on top and eat. wow just amazing!!! great chef!! housemade meatballs with green garlic and ricotta was the highlight and just awesome!! these flavor packed and tender meatballs are delicious and topped off a power packed flavor symphony!!! i want to thank the purple pig for the chef's culinary creativity and amazing display of plating!!! wow you are on my top  restaurants in chicago!! thanks!!!!"
1006,Letty H.,1128,5,7/8/18,"a lot of people come here for the wine and cheese! the wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone here. i came for the food and i thought it was delicious! the food here is meant to be shared and that is what we did! we started with the calamari. for once, we got calamari that was not fried and i was not expecting to like it, but it was one of our favorite dishes! it comes cold and with plenty of flavor. it is a very refreshing dish and i recommend it. the roasted bone marrow was tasty! it comes with an herb salad and sea salt on the side. i like that we can add our own salt to the bone marrow and the herb salad was not bad! it had a lot of cilantro, which i am not too fond of, but the sauce really overpowered the cilantro so i could not taste much of it. next was the milk braised berkshire shoulder. it was soft but way too salty for us. the taste was a little heavy, especially with the mashed potatoes. lastly, we had the turkey leg confit one of our favorites! it was delicious and the portion was huge! it did not have a bone in it and was so tender. the seasoning was delicious. overall, i enjoyed the different flavors here. it was unfamiliar yet delicious. i recommend if you are in the area!"
1007,Dev F.,1128,5,7/1/18,"after reading a few convincing reviews, we were sold! the purple pig did not disappoint. our road trip from california ended in chicago at probably the best restaurant us weary travelers were treated to. the food the crispy chicken skin with beans and crunchy veggies was freshly cooked and the skin  crispy. the roasted broccoli was so delicious, it was  year old picky eater approved! oysters were briny and meaty. six was just the right size for two to have room for other tastings. personally, i could have eaten a dozen more! the octopus with fingerling potatoes and green beans in salsa verde was to die for! tender and perfectly seasoned. i regretted having to share it. roasted bone marrow was a creamy spread over crunchysoft toasted bread that paired well with the caper herb salad. pork spare ribs were fall off the bones , smokey and fingerlickin'good. service staff perfectly timed our food that they were delivered one after the other and fresh from the kitchen. highly recommend? but of course!"
1008,Sally Y.,1128,5,6/22/18,"the purple pig was one of the highly recommended spots to try by a friend. they definitely did not disappoint. the dishes are mediterranean inspired small plates that are meant to be shared. our waitress suggested we order  dishes for our group of , so we decided to order four since we were eating our way through chicago. crispy pig's ear fried pig's ear served with kale, pickled cherry peppers and a fried egg. the dish was perfectly salted and reminded me of chicharones. pasta of the day there was no specific name for the pasta of the day, but it was a chicken bolognese sauce served with linguine pasta and garnished with stinging nettle and micro greens. the pasta was not too heavy and fragrant. after this dish, i think i like chicken bolognese more than beef bolognese. roasted bone marrow  served with an herb salad, toast and sea salt. the server recommended we spread the bone marrow on the toast and add some of the herb salad. it was the perfect combination. the herb salad was light and citrusy and broke down the heaviness of the bone marrow . i personally did not think there was a need to add extra sea salt. the herb salad was salted enough for the rest of the bone marrow not to need any. milk braised berkshire shoulder everything about this dish was amazing. the meat was so soft and tender it separated very easily. the mashed potatoes were very creamy and i loved how light the puffed farro. both sides paired very well with the shoulder. tldr i would definitely recommend ordering the milk braised berkshire shoulder and the roasted bone marrow ."
1009,Mindy D.,1128,4,6/17/18,"this is a hot spot for tourists and we were lucky to be seated right away at a community table with other strangers. the restuarant is located right next to the river with lovely views from where i sat on the patio. service was good. we decided on the grilled octopus my personal favorite!, turkey leg confit, and grilled broccoli. the octopus was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. it was paired with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. the broccoli was really tasty because of the anchovy vinaigrette, roasted garlic, and toasted bread crumbs on top. such a unique and exquisite way to eat broccoli! the turkey leg was probably the only item that did not wow me as because it did not seem much different than the turkey leg i can get at a fair. it was drenched in a sweet sauce, topped with lentils and came with bed of cabbage. i like the tapas style of this restaurant and there are other items on the menu i would come back to try like the roasted bone marrow ."
1010,Vanessa T.,1128,2,6/8/18,"came across this place on yelp and saw it had many reviews and the name was pretty cute so we decided to come for dinner. our friend said this place was good but quite pricey but we still wanted to give it a try. there were plenty of seating outside and inside. so we chose to sit inside. we decided to order the roasted bone marrow , cavatelli pasta , milk braised pork shoulder , and  selection of the brigante al tartufo cheese platter . the roasted bone marrow was probably the best dish that we ordered. it was recommended by our friend and definitely enjoyed it. it came with some baguettes and arugula. the pasta was probably the most unexpected dish. it was basically ravioli wrapped with a goat cheese filling. the goat cheese was overpowering and extremely creamy. it was definitely one of the worst dish that we had. the pork shoulder also took forever to come out. we were done with our dishes and the pork shoulder was still not out yet. the pork was alright. it was a bit dried but paired with the mashed potatoes, it was manageable. lastly, the cheese platter was great! the cheese was light and refreshing. it came with some cracker bites and jelly. the combination was to die for! overall, i would recommend the bone marrow and the cheese platter. the pasta was the worst dish we had. and the pork shoulder was just alright. we were looking forward to our experience here and it just did not meet our expectations. our waiter also was not very nice. he seemed too cool to answer our questions and seemed to smirk a lot when taking our order."
1011,Monique N.,1128,3,6/3/18,"unfortunately, i did not think the food here was as great as other reviews proclaim! i was visiting chicago from california, and i added this place on my restaurant list since there is tons of good praise and some even claim this is the best food they had in chicago... which i either ordered the wrong things or there is other restaurants to discover. i came here on saturday party of  at opening, am. i was a little afraid of the line since it was long and moving slowly, but i did end up making it during this first seating! they managed to get everyone seated and serving plates relatively quickly considering the amount of people all ordering at once. it is tapas style, and i believe our waitress said around  plates per person. we ordered  to share between the  of us because i do not have the biggest lunch appetite. a lot of the dishes, i liked what they did with the accompanying sides it is made with, but not necessarily the meatseafood. the dishes definitely have innovative flavors and looked great though.  roasted bone marrow  the only dish i thoroughly enjoyed & would highly recommend!!  crispy pig's ear the crispy kale is delicious but the pigs ear is basically just like... fried flavorless crunches added to it and became a burden to eat  grilled octopus the octopus was just bland and dry despite the salsa verde. the green beans with it were good though. i do wish i had a bigger party to try more things and not have to eat so much of the same dish, since that is the way to go for tapas so maybe that would have been the key to really getting to enjoy this place."
1012,Evan I.,1128,5,5/30/18,"chicago is packed full of great food, but i always end up back at the purple pig whenever i visit. the dinner line is long no matter what night you go, but they let you give your phone number and head elsewhere for some drinks while you wait. i highly highly recommend going here with a large group so that you can try more things on the menu. i have been with a group of  every time i have gone and have not had a bad dish yet. the menu has changed just a tad each time, but to keep this review manageable, the following dishes are mustorders each time we go the octopus a la plancha so flavorful and tender, not chewy or rubbery at all, roasted bone marrow , and the crispy pig's ears with kale and a fried egg. unfortunately, whenever i order these dishes elsewhere now, they end up disappointing because i compare them to the purple pig...seriously so good here, it is amazing. get yourself a bottle of red wine and go to town on as many dishes as you can, they are all delicious! my first visit here still holds the title for best meal i have ever had"
1013,Maisee T.,1128,5,5/27/18,"great food and great service! we went prior to the opening of lunch, and there was already a line! thankfully once it opened, we were seated right away. the two of us ordered  chorizostuffed olives the greek yogurt sauce was a great contrast to offset the saltiness of the olives  roasted bone marrow like buttah!  grilled octopus soft and well seasoned  crispy pig's ear  seafood saganaki our favorite. i wished we were given a load of bread to soak up the sauce. everyone in your party must be present to be seated!"
1014,Ruth D.,1128,3,5/22/18,"very popular place, with approx. a  hour wait time on a saturday. the food was pretty good but, for me, did not live up to the hype. we had grilled octopus & half duck confit  all pretty good. roasted butternut squash was the tastiest of our dishes. would not recommend the roasted bone marrow  we are usually fans of marrow but this was very greasyfatty. also, they pack people in so tightly that the lady sitting next to us had to leave her seat to let us inout of ours. and, there are only  toilets in the entire restaurant, which seats hundreds of people, so there are always long queues. also, everything was so salty. i drank twothree glasses of water with dinner & still woke up several times that night absolutely parched. i know americans like their food well seasoned but this was to an extreme."
1015,Rima M.,1128,5,5/18/18,"i love this place, love it, love it! it do realise it is hyped and touristy, but it is every bit worth the hype. during the summer, i went  times in  months no kidding. the wait is freakishly long even on weekdays and service is alright, but the food really does make up for any downsides. i personally love the roasted bone marrow and the octopus  but you cannot really go wrong with much of the menu. my only wish is that they will, in the future, accept reservations !! and the food continues to live up to the hype in time to come."
1016,Lynna P.,1128,4,5/9/18,"located on the magnificent mile, this place is always packed! they do not take reservations so be prepared to wait for a while. the best time to get the fastest table are before pm or after pm. for singles, best bet is to fight out and snatch that first open seat at the bar. the setting is pretty dark inside and it gets pretty hot due to the amount of people. you will get the occasional bump behind your chair from folks trying to wait inside to get a seat at the bar. plenty of wine options and the drink menu is robust. now onto the food... the food menu is loaded with food to fulfill your palate. i ordered the following . grilled broccoli  grilled with roasted garlic, drizzled with anchovy vinaigrette, topped with breadcrumbs. the vegetable is grilled to perfection with the broccoli crowns being soft and the stalks soft and crunchy. the vinaigrette may have been a bit too much and made the dish more salty. maybe a little less and it would have been better. . crispy pig ears  do not let the name scare you. crunchy pieces and the sunny side up egg, kale, and pickled peppers enhances the flavor and gives you different tastes as you eat your way through the plate. . roasted bone marrow  amazing!!! fatty, buttery goodness! it is a must try! pair it with a chianti classico to cleanse your palate and enjoy each bite as if it were your first time eating. . sicilian iris  this is their popular dessert. it takes a while to make and comes in hot so careful on the first bite. its like a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate and topped with confectionary sugar. pair it with a dry madeira for your dessert drink. overall, the food is great! you cannot go wrong with their food. the drink and wine selections are huge and they can pair your food with the perfect drink. service was great no matter how busy and packed it was. the only drawback is the wait time for a table and no reservations."
1017,Charlene S.,1128,4,5/7/18,"i was super excited to try the purple pig for lunch and i was mostly impressed! i got to the restaurant about  minutes before they opened to ensure that i would get seated. the roasted bone marrow with herb salad and sicilian sea salt was delicious without being too greasy. the large bone was served with several pieces of thick crunchy bread, some greens, and sea salt. a spoonful of that bone marrow with that bread, and i was in heaven! we were basically fighting over the last pieces of that bone marrow ! the fava bean spread was pretty average. a few pieces of bread with some spread, which basically tasted like hummus. i would not get again. crispy pig's ears was not my favorite dish. i thought the entire dish was too greasy, but i did enjoy the blend of veggies kale and peppers, along with the perfectly fried runny egg. i would not get again. the grilled octopus came with fingerling potatoes, green beans and salsa verde. the octopus was super tender and perfectly cooked, though the entire dish was too salty. all of the individual components were salty, as was the salsa verde, which made everything too salty. the milk braised berkshire shoulder with mashed potatoes and puffed farro was absolutely incredible! the meat was so tender and basically fell apart in my mouth. as a lover of mashed potatoes, i was happy that these were creamy and not lumpy. i am generally not a big fan of desserts but knew i had to try the sicilian iris, which was a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. cutting open the dessert was glorious, and the taste matched the appearance just as well. i loved how creamy the filling was without being too sweet. purple pig is so close to  stars for me, but some of the dishes were just too salty and oily for my liking. i would definitely come back for the pork shoulder and bone marrow !"
1018,Sindy W.,1128,4,5/2/18,"how about .? i understand that in the downtown of chicago, there will always be a long line for a seat and a packed seating arrangement in the restaurant ... but the two of us were uncomfortably squished side by side on a long table with many other groups ... i mean we still loved the food and the waiter was awesome! we had about a .hour wait, but we quickly spent that in the shopping mall down the road! they are also so kind to text and call you to let you know that the table is ready! after the text they give you ten minutes to get back to the restaurant! so do not wonder off too far! we got . on their specials menu avocado crab salad ? avocado tempura | crab salad & radish, and some other goodness that i do not remember the names of  it was so refreshing to start with! . crispy pig's ears worth a try! but you really cannot tell if they are pig's ears texture and taste wise but the pork fat definitely shines through the taste! still a super tasty dish! . roasted bone marrow super tasty combination of the bread, bone marrow , and salad  the dish also comes with some salt that you can sprinkle on the bone marrow ! we also got a glass of white wine and a glass of red wine  both were lovely! i will be back to try all the other tasty looking dishes on the menu! hopefully with a better seat next time!"
1019,Sam L.,1128,4,4/10/18,came here a minute after they opened on a saturday and there were people seated already. goes to show how popular this touristy tapas spot is! food  roasted bone marrow  .. mm smear that marrow on perfectly toasted bread with some herb salad & throw in some salt bae action. bam. delish.  octopus . cooked perfectly! only qualm was the salsa verde... so salty...  braised pork shoulder . omg mouthwatering highly recommend. you know it be good if the meat falls apart with a tiny touch of the fork. also bias because i am a lover of mashed potatoes. so this dish did it for me. service quick. in and out in an hour. we inquired about how much to order and the waiter was spot on. ambiance they have indoor and outdoor seating.
1020,Larry H.,1128,5,3/7/18,"i had the roasted bone marrow with herb salad  sicilian sea salt. the bone marrow was the spread, which you can add sea salt for more flavor. the salad has sour vinger that goes well with the salt. bone marrow alone has a buttery texture, but when all four  marrow , vinegar salad, sea salt, buttery toasted bread are combine, it is worth the experience. no reservations and you go right in. i did not have wine this time, but i will next time."
1021,Kitty K.,1128,4,10/10/18,"delicious  i literally had the best beets of my life here! so damn good ! the octopus was tender and cooked to perfection my husband thought it was a little too acidic , but i really loved it . we also ordered the pigs ear , it was my first time eating crispy pigs ear and i probably would not order it again , do not get me wrong it was perfectly balanced and delicious , but the pigs ear does not really add any taste, just seems to give a crunch element . i saw the bone marrow being taken out and i will forever regret not ordering that ...."
1022,Sarah B.,1128,5,9/30/18,"this is probably one of my favorite places in chicago. so much good meat! the crispy pigs ear with duck egg, magnificent. love to take small groups here because it is not large! and have a great experience every time."
1023,Amanda L.,1128,5,8/20/18,"the purple pig was probably one of the most memorable meals i have had in a while. my boyfriend i were in chicago for vacation and i really wanted to try this place because of the reviews on yelp. needless to say i was very happy that our plans worked out. we ordered the crispy pigs ears , chicken bolognese pasta, and the blade steak. our waiter was very great and informative that our plates did not have a course order. the plates would come out whichever was ready first. the crispy pigs ears were my favorite. i loved the crunchy texture and flavors the plate had. i have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful, yet so simple. my boyfriend was blown away by the chicken pasta. it was just the right amount of pasta and sauce ratio and the flavor was outstanding. the purple pig was definitely the highlight of our trip! looking back at the pictures makes me want to book a flight to chicago and dine at this amazing restaurant again. until next time!"
1024,Alex M.,1128,5,8/5/18,"this place is incredible, ans delivers on all of the hype it gets. shame that restaurant politics got in the way of their stars the past couple years. this is a mustdo when visiting chicago and probably my nd or rd favorite restaurant in the whole city. couple of quick notes they do not take reservations, but you can put your name on the list and they will text you when your table is ready. a friend and i went around  on a friday night last month and waited probably ~ minutes. also be mindful that the place is not very big the climatecontrolled patio helps you will be cozy with those around you and it will be a bit noisy. probably not a good spot for kids or a first date, but if you are looking for a fun spot with friends or your so, purple pig is great. i am not a huge wine drinker but their list of reds is extensive, if you are into that sort of thing. i would recommend getting a cheese board to start. they rotate the cheeses seasonally ask your server for suggestions, and when in doubt, lean toward our neighbors to the north wisconsin. the cheese boards come with jam and pita crackers, which they provide for free, and they jam is delicious. we ordered the broccoli, rissoto gnocchi, calamari, all of which was unbelievable. gnocchi was probably my favorite the flavor and texture caught me offguard. we eschewed the octopus, given my seafood allergy, but i know this is a fan favorite as well. instead we opted for the neopolotian pizza. we concluded with the worldfamous pork shoulder. this along with the pigs ears  are the musthave items on the menu. how they get the meat to cut like butter is beyond me. ok tldr it is worth the wait and meets the hype. go for it."
1025,Todd C.,1128,5,7/31/18,"the purple pig is consistently one of my favorite restaurants in chicago and this trip did not disappoint. we ordered  items and split them between the  of us. the pigs ears were the favorite but the short ribs, chicken kebabs and grilled broccoli were amazing as well. we look forward to our next trip when we return to chicago."
1026,Eric N.,1128,4,7/30/18,reasonable wait times for a popular place. went on a monday night around  and waited about  mins for a table for . carefully planned out dishes that offer a flavor burst in your mouth. pigs ears and pork shoulder were by far my favorite. pork shoulder was difficult to pick up with a fork as it kept falling apart with how tender the meat was. would go back again
1027,Harini P.,1128,4,7/26/18,"love this place. their bone marrow and friend pigs ears are amazing! their pork fat roasted almonds are something i often dream of. it looks like such an amazing spot merely because of the location but this is a rare gem that has location, flavor and service. trust me, this is a trifecta in chicago."
1028,Ryan C.,1128,4,7/21/18,"good, expensive, unique, surprising. all for the dishes were great. they are served as soon as they come out of the kitchen, so the pace can be erratic. the cost for two people for lunch without alcohol was . it was interesting to see offal and pigs ears on the menu. we were adventurous and had crispy pig's ear and smoke pork tongue. these were super tasty and would never know the source if you had not been told. what did i learn? the patio seating is nice, but it can be cold and breezy out there."
1029,M. N.,1128,2,7/16/18,"let us be real. purple pig is not going anywhere and this review is not going to affect business for them. but sometimes you have such a bad experience that you actually want to take the time to write a review on your lunch break at work. i was here last night with my best friend who lives in chicago. i wanted to show him a hot spot, as i was visiting for the weekend no longer live in chicago we also wanted to go to lao sze chuan but they were closed we were looking for a place still open around  and i really wish they were not..! we get sat just after pm because i remember yelp said it closes in  mins when we walked in. we were greeted a little late at our table. no suggestions for my friend who has never been there. i order the pigs ears and beets as they were not doing brussels sprouts out of season. after the plates were dropped off, one female busser kept trying to clear the plate with the beets on it just after a few bites. also when the pigs ears and razor clams were dropped off they neglected the beets platter that was clearly finished and i put to the side so i had to kindly ask them to remove it. shortly after the bone marrow was dropped off, i took one spoonful and another female busser tried clearing it! there was one razor clam left and we left all the other empty shells on the plate and as i was eating the last one, a female server took the plate out of the way. i deliberately left the she will on the bare table in place of where the plate was and no one took it off the table, yet decided to place the chicken drumsticks our last order on top so the plate was leaning. right after our last platter which was the leaning chicken was dropped off, our server rushed and asked if we wanted dessert. he never mentioned it was because the kitchen was closing or anything. at least mention that if that is the case instead of just rushing rushing rushing..! we were so rushed i was turned off and had to bring it to my server's attention. i told him hey i get it you guys are closing but this is not okay. he was honestly not that empathetic and when i brought it to his attention that i even worked there a few years back and was shocked at the quality of service we were getting, he questioned it and said he has worked here for  years and asked when i worked there. i had to name drop and prove i worked there. how offensive and snobby the way he asked..! also sorry but you know you cannot keep track of everyone who has worked there with an extremely high turnover rate our server's name was michael p. michael did not even offer us coffees on the house, or a percentage off, or have a manager come by to apologize. nothing. and when we asked for a togo container he put the leftovers on the ground next to our feet!! you do not do that! i am personally never going back and will never recommend it to anyone ever again. the service server and bussers has really changed and we were absolutely appalled. just because your food is well known and still delicious, does not mean your pretense is welcomed or really allowed. be more humble and apologetic and make your guests feel welcome and offer something or at least a nice apology to make up for the numerous mistakes that happened within that  minute time frame. i just finished eating at cheesecake factory in beverly hills no, certainly nothing like purple pig or other great chicago spots out here unfortunately and they have astronomical service as always. maybe you guys can learn from them "
1030,Rich M.,1128,5,7/8/18,"one of the best meals i have had in years. hands down. unbelievable food. great drink options. fantastic service. my wife travels to chicago for business on a regular basis. this restaurant has been on her list. i am so glad we took the time. we arrived at the purple pig at slightly before  on a saturday afternoon. the restaurant was full which, to me, is always a great sign early afternoon. we put our name on the waiting list and sat down outside. we had barely sat when a very helpful server alexander offered us cocktails. of course we obliged. both of our choices were expertly crafted. we were off to a good start. after an approximately  minute wait we sat down at a small table inside. just walking from the front door to our table exposed us to dozens of mouthwatering plates. we ordered another round of drinks and decided to start with a combination of meats and cheeses. for meat we went with blood mortadella, lingua and the salumi. for cheese we went with the grayson, a french triple creme and another that escapes me. we paired this with the marcona almonds in honey. everything was simply superb. we then had the crispy pigs ears . the pig is sliced thin and long and mixed with kale, peppers and topped with a fried egg. it is salty, crunchy, savory and everything that is right with the world. we then had the grilled octopus. while this was my least favorite item, it was still quite good. the octopus is prepared with fingerling potatoes and green beans with a salsa verde. for me this was a texture thing. most cooked octopus that i have had is charred, while this was seemingly sauteed. after switching to glasses of wine we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder. dear sweet baby jesus is this fantastic. the pork was preposterously tender  we barely touched it and it fell apart. had it been more socially acceptable, i would have licked the plate. utter perfection. overall it was an outstanding meal. i look forward to returning soon."
1031,Mimi L.,1128,1,7/6/18,"i was so disappointed with the food and service. we waited  hour for our seating, which was ok but the server that was supposed to take our drink order as we waited outside showed up as we were about to get seated. we ordered the broccoli, pigs ears , beets, blade steak, cheese and sausage and only one thing tasted good. the beets were good, but nothing to come back for. the pig ears tasted like fried batter, no flavor and just crunchy oily batter. the broccoli had a strange after taste. the blade pork steak did not stand out. would not recommend this place as there are so many other places in chicago to try."
1032,Mortaric M.,1128,5,7/2/18,"it is like chinese fine dining. all those strange dishes you may find at authentic chinese restaurants, only here they are well presented with unique flavour pairings. the orange olive vegetables, crispy pigs ears , bbq pigs tongue and sweet pork belly so tender were all really great. the deserts were also so good. the rhubarb raspberry crumble was sweet and tart, and the guava white chocolate desert was perfect. the casual atmosphere was nice. only two bathrooms, so there was constantly a lineup and they get a little dirty. watch out for if they try to seat you outside in the back hallway, there is no air circulation and it kind of sucks. you are better off to ask to wait for other seating. the rest of the patio gets some decent circulation, and indoors is consistently good."
1033,Lisa H.,1128,4,6/17/18,"no reservations and always crowded. too much hype because it is an old establishment? we  a party of  got lucky when we showed up around lunch time and did not have to wait. yes, they sat us at a communal table but who cares? we got to know our neighbors and saw what they ordered. this is what we ordered for a party of  adults and  young kids. house made meatballs very moist and delicious, sweet potato polenta and whipped burrata cheese the flavors are amazing...really good, crispy pigs ears salad good because it is fried, and the turkey leg confit too salty for me and the flavors did not really jive well reason for the  stars was for the service. not a friendly waiter and had to call him a few times before he would come out with our request. would i come back again, probably not. the food did not wow me. there are too many good restaurants in chicago."
1034,Dustin M.,1128,5,6/7/18,the fact that i have lived in chicago for almost  years now and have not been to the purple pig is unfortunate. i went here for for a work dinner with three others. we tried  different plates! every single dish was incredible and had such a savory taste to each dish. must get the duck & the crispy pigs ears !
1035,Monique N.,1128,3,6/3/18,"unfortunately, i did not think the food here was as great as other reviews proclaim! i was visiting chicago from california, and i added this place on my restaurant list since there is tons of good praise and some even claim this is the best food they had in chicago... which i either ordered the wrong things or there is other restaurants to discover. i came here on saturday party of  at opening, am. i was a little afraid of the line since it was long and moving slowly, but i did end up making it during this first seating! they managed to get everyone seated and serving plates relatively quickly considering the amount of people all ordering at once. it is tapas style, and i believe our waitress said around  plates per person. we ordered  to share between the  of us because i do not have the biggest lunch appetite. a lot of the dishes, i liked what they did with the accompanying sides it is made with, but not necessarily the meatseafood. the dishes definitely have innovative flavors and looked great though.  roasted bone marrow the only dish i thoroughly enjoyed & would highly recommend!!  crispy pig's ear  the crispy kale is delicious but the pigs ear is basically just like... fried flavorless crunches added to it and became a burden to eat  grilled octopus the octopus was just bland and dry despite the salsa verde. the green beans with it were good though. i do wish i had a bigger party to try more things and not have to eat so much of the same dish, since that is the way to go for tapas so maybe that would have been the key to really getting to enjoy this place."
1036,Chris C.,1128,4,4/19/18,"this place is always crowded and most of the seating is at huge high top tables with other guests or the bar. do not let this sway you from going here because despite this setup, the service was excellent, and we had a really great time. the food is out of this world. everything we got was delicious, well prepared and presented beautifully. a water glass never went empty and the drink specials and choices were excellent as well. the menu is mostly small plates, and everything was delicious. try the pigs ears and you will not be disappointed. this is definitely one of our favorite places in the mag. mile area."
1037,Kevin C.,1128,4,3/31/18,"food is good. service leaves something to be desired. interesting how a restaurant that can out out high quality food cannot get its staffing figured out. with at least  staff on the floor it was disappointing to see that everything moved so slowly considering the limited number of seats. it is almost like the staff are not trained at all and significantly overstaffed. we were texted to notify us that our table was ready, and the front of house staff mentioned it would be another few minutes to get our table ready. meanwhile we stood there watching him and one of the hostesses peering over to an empty table that was not set. at least  other staff just stood around the podium with seemingly no purpose.  minutes goes by and all they can do is stand and stare to see if anyone would set the table. eventually we got seated at another table that was actually available the whole time. a couple of folks who looked like upper management also appeared to mill around the restaurant aimlessly and our waitress was nowhere to be found throughout the meal. foodwise the fried pigs ears were great and octopus legs more tender than any i have ever had. hummus was tasty and not at all spicy like the waitress tried to warn us about. the matcha bomb dessert was ok but matcha plus chocolate plus lime is an odd combination despite the amazing presentation."
1038,erika s.,1128,5,2/26/18,the crispy pigs ears with kale are hands down the best dish in chicago!
1039,Vivian M.,1128,5,12/3/17,"a must!! i liked it more than girl and the goat and we just showed up a little after opening and were seated immediately. no wait. we had the octopus, beet salad, pork shoulder, butternut squash soup, and pigs ear . all great pics! we looked over and the table next to us had almost exactly the same thing. guess all the reviews are true and you should get them because they are the most popular for a reason! my favorites were the octopus and pork shoulder. the mashed potatoes and gravy beneath the pork shoulder were heavenly. the octopus is the best i have ever had!! i am drooling thinking about it. the pigs ear dish was also delicious! i was scraping the plate clean. i would not let them clear the table until the plate was spotless, it was so good."
1040,Richard D.,1128,5,11/6/18,"you know when you enter a place and the line is packed inside and out that you are going to experience something amazing! well this tapas place was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had. needless to say everything tasted fresh and every plate made was beautiful! i decided to try the grilled octopus , seafood saganaki, jamon dish and the chilled calamari! every single one of these dishes were flavorful, tasty and just outright amazing! i also want to say the grilled octopus's was out of this world! perfectly made, tender and just outright tasty!"
1041,Lindsey D.,1128,5,11/6/18,"upon getting here we checked in with the hostess and she quoted us a min wait, we then went to the small waiting areas with the amazing outdoor heaters. someone greeted us and we ordered some wine while we waited for our table. we were seated within min. i highly recommend the beets with whipped goat cheese, the octopus and the croquettes. each were simply amazing and flavorful. definitely put this on your list if you are coming to chicago!"
1042,Mitesh S.,1128,5,11/4/18,"definitely a  star meal. they do not take reservations, but you can track your progress on the waitlist via yelp, which is quite helpful. it took about  mins to get a table for two this past saturday night, and it was totally worth it. i ordered a rye whiskey cocktail off the original cocktails list, and it was delicious. our waiter provided excellent service. he recommended  plates between the two of us. we were super hungry, and ordered  plates, which was probably a bit excessive.  we ordered the following . cornbread . beet salad . pasta with octopus red sauce . chicken thigh kabobs and potatoes . cuttle fish with red pepper aioli the kabobs were likely our least favorite, but still quite tasty. everything else was exceptional. definitely recommend this place, despite the wait time!"
1043,B T.,1128,4,11/4/18,"stopped by on a saturday afternoon.  they were busy but we are able to  seats at a large table for us. service was timely, menu broad and the wine list deep.  we tried the pork shoulder, octopus and salmon. pork shoulder was good asking to what your mother made, octopus was suprising in a good way not chewy and tough, but tender and nice like the danny zuko that dandy knew from the summer. the star however was the salmon. beautifully cooked and extraordinarily delicious."
1044,Jessica C.,1128,5,11/3/18,"this was by far the best dining experience we have had. coming here for wine and cheese we very quickly realized we would be eating more because everything coming out of that kitchen looked amazing. our server, brian was awesome and his recommendations were spot on. we started with wine and cheese. then a caprese salad that was out of this world. the charred octopus was the best i have had and thanks to our lovely neighbors at the table we were able to try the stuffed squid delicious! then the pork shoulder. omg melt in your mouth. i am so full but still thinking about that pork! last but not least the dessert. just when i thought i could not eat anymore! not sure of name but was a brioche type pastry maybe filled with ricotta and chocolate. i am not a big dessert person but my husband did let me have most of it. very thankful for that cuz it was amazing! i would recommend to anyone and everyone to go here and confident you will have the same experience as we did. great job purple pig!"
1045,Emily G.,1128,5,11/3/18,all i can say is wow. i never write reviews but this meal was out of this world and worth the wait! pro tip  try the octopus you will not be disappointed!
1046,Dana O.,1128,4,10/31/18,"i have been wanting to try purple pig for years and the food definitely did not disappoint! they do not take reservations so a coworker and i fought our way through the crowd to put our names on the list. . hour wait so we headed to pop for some champs. we got a text message maybe  min later so rushed back as you have  min to get there or your reservation goes to someone else which is understandable. we were sat at a community table where they had originally asked us to crawl behind people into a tight middle of the table space. we asked for the corner that was open which they were not pleased about because they were saving it for larger people. honestly, it is so tight in there anyway we could not move as it is. our server, kyle was not the friendliest i have ever had. it is as if we were testing his patients with the few questions we had. we ordered a  bottle just do a full that did not seem as so and when he asked if we wanted another i said sure, but the first one did not even seem like a half. he said well i did not pour it so i do not know in a very snarky tone. i said i know, just commenting on it where he continued to say well i did not pour it, yeah yeah i know. anyway, we ended up sitting next to an amazing couple that we became friends with and shared some food with too. they felt the same on service, we were a nuisance. we had octopus  so good, caponata  hesitant to try but glad i did, ribs  cannot go wrong there and brussels  flavor was good just wish the sprouts we are bigger, it was just all the layers. would i go back ehh maybe but there is a lot of great places in chicago."
1047,Esther K.,1128,5,10/29/18,"could not wait to try this place when we visited chicago. we tried several dishes and none of them disappointed bone marrow very smooth and decadent. beef tendon chips probably our least favorite dish, but still good. very crispy. gnocchi with oxtail ragu best dish. hands down. could have eaten three of these. grilled octopus  amazing. cannot wait to go back!"
1048,Geoffrey C.,1128,4,10/28/18,"this was also another restaurant i was highly interested trying. party of  on a thursday night, wait was about  minutes. this place is very tight, particularly inside. we were seated right in front of the cooks where they prepare their food, so it was a nice view the whole time. they have a very extensive menu so it can be difficult to decide. fortunately, our server was incredibly helpful. lengua and salami  started off with this. salami was ok but the lengua had awesome texture and flavor brussels sprouts  it was cooked with a nice crisp while still tasting fresh. recommend! bone marrow  was a bit too rich and fatty for me. appearance wise, it does not look too appetizing. spread it on your bread and you are good to go. grilled broccoli  this is incredibly popular here but i just found it okay. i think the sauce was too rich and changed the textureflavor of broccoli too much. pork belly  fatty goodness with a sweetsugary sauce. recommend! cavatelli  skip it, was not a fan. octopus flavored pasta did not really do it for me. octopus a la plancha  flavor good. texture  meh. ocotpus tasted a bit overcooked and had a dry texture to it. creme brle  i love me some pomegranate. combine that with dark chocolate and you have an interesting take on this classic dessert. bootsy collins  fruity gin drink. recommend if you like gin!"
1049,Lindsay J.,1128,5,10/27/18,"went to chicago for a conference last week and had multiple people suggest that i give this place a try. i was hesitant at first, as the restaurant does not take reservations and i read that the wait is typically long. however, on my last night i decided it to give it a try after having a chicago style hot dog for a snack at  pm, and figured i could probably wait a bit for dinner. our party of two got there around  pm on a saturday, and was told that the wait was going to be  minutes. my so very much did not wish to wait, but i convinced him that it might be worth it. we ended up taking a very nice walk around the area, and the lights, buildings, and river were all beautiful so time passed quickly. when we got back, we sat under the heated lamps probably for about  minutes before our table was ready. for two people, we were told that  dishes is the norm. we are from nyc so are used to small tapas dishes. we ended up doing  because we cannot resist.....fried brussel sprouts, liver pate, cavatelli with octopus , a sheep's milk cheese with moscato jelly yum!, homemade greek sausage. everything was truly, truly excellent, and had multiple levels and depths of flavor. the liver pate was especially surprising, as it had remarkable complexity but can get rich. all the dishes would be considered mediumsized, i think. this was a lot of food for us, but we still could not resist getting dessert. we ordered the bone marrow pound cake which was fabulous. we thought it was going to be baked fresh so did not really mind that it took about  min for it to be brought out, however our waitress then told us that it was going to be on the house because it took so long! this was such a pleasant surprise and very nice of the restaurant. now i have joined one of those people that recommend this place to everyone who is going to chicago! will absolutely be back next time!"
1050,Ann H.,1128,5,10/21/18,the pig ear is good but not taste like ear. the bone marrow is great as expected. the octopus is very nice! the kale is fried well
1051,Daniel A.,1128,4,10/20/18,"the purple pig was my favourite food experience in chicago! despite the hourlong wait to get seated, it turned out to be worthwhile. myself and a couple others shared  plates, which filled us up! ranked in order from best to worse, we tried bone marrow, octopus , pig ears, neck bone gravy, and sausage. the first two were to die for but you could probably skip the latter . also, space was really, really tight."
1052,angela l.,1128,4,10/19/18,"old neighbors wanted to take us to another popular restaurant but it was too busy, so they instead booked here which is also one of their favorites. it was a wednesday early evening, yet already packed! we opted to sit on the enclosed patio because the noise level inside was unbearable. there were overhanging heaters above the outdoor seats, so i felt quite cozy. the service was very efficient, friendly. our host was very happy with his pick of the bottle of wine. between  of us we ordered  dishes stuffed octopus , pork tongues, half roasted duck, squid and pig ears. my favorite was the duck which was tender yet outside crispexcellent!! the squid was very fresh and tasty! the pork tongues and the octopus were too salty for all of us that our hostess asked for some bread which they usually stay away. i have heard many people raved about this place over the year and finally came to try myself. i have to say it was good experience overall, only wish it was not as noisy!"
1053,Tina T.,1128,5,10/18/18,"the food i had at the purple pig will remain a favorite food memory. i went with colleagues and together we shared the octopus a la plancha, fried brussel sprouts, pork belly, pork tongue, turkey leg, crispy pig ears, 'njuda, and cannoli cream stuffed fried dough. we were still talking about it the next day. amazing! and i do not know how they can have such a diverse and full menu with such limited kitchen space."
1054,Nancy A.,1128,5,10/17/18,"service was excellent, food was beyond amazing. although, we had to wait to be seated definitely recommend to wait by the bar. bar tenders were very friendly with great recommendations. we ordered the grilled octopus , eggplant and broccoli. broccoli is a must! is a must when visiting chicago."
1055,Michelle K.,1128,5,10/16/18,"in the  nights that we stayed in chicago, purple pig was by far our favorite meal! we got seated right away at a community table. neither of us have any problems sitting with others and we angled our chairs to keep to ourselves anyways. we started our meal with some local beers and the olive appetizer. oh, em, gee. the olives were warmedcharred with shaved celery, a mustard type sauce and grilled bread. we both were just in awe of how delicious these olives were. we knew right away we were going to love everything on the menu. we had such a hard time choosing what we wanted next. the octopus , the panini, the cheese boards all sounded so heavenly. we ended up going with creating our own charcuterie plate. we opted for a smoked goat cheese, a sharp cheddar, and then we let the waiter pick our third. we got two meats that included duck prosciutto & air cured beef. it came with a few accompaniments like olives, and spreads. we both loved it and it was the perfect portion for the two of us to share. i think we could have sat here and ate all night trying everything on the menu but we had plans that we had to get to. yes it is pricey, but the food quality is worth the price you are paying. the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and quick. i was in love with this place."
1056,Ryan G.,1128,5,10/12/18,"overall, i will give this place  stars primarily for the taste of the food. my only issue with places like this is i spend a lot of money but still leave hungry, which was no different here. i guess my suggestion would be do not come here if you are starving, or plan on emptying your bank account. the food, however, is always high quality. i came here on a thursday night around  and there was a ~ minute wait for a party of . the place is very crowded and tight as most people have mentioned, but it makes sense because the place is very popular so i would prefer that over an extra long wait. after i got the text notifying me of my table being ready, we were seated right away and our waiter was there quickly. i ordered the double ipa on special do not remember what it was and it was pretty good, but as you would expect for this kind of beer it was a pretty small glass and cost . for food, we ordered the deviled eggs, octopus cavatelli, greek sausage, and steak. in order of preference  steak  i cannot remember what kind of steak this was, but i know it was served with green garlic and breadcrumbs. this was definitely my favorite dish. the meat cut easily with a butter knife and it was so flavorful. there were about  slices on the plate, each slice being roughly  bites.  sausage  this was very tasty as well. no complaints, and the portion was not too small.  deviled egg  this was the best deviled egg i have ever had, but i was a little disappointed that the order only came with  egg for .  cavatelli  this dish was a decent portion size but i thought the sauce lacked flavor."
1057,Priscilla R.,1128,5,9/30/18,"was visiting chicago, my favorite city, for a bachelorette weekend. amongst the funfilled events of complete debauchery i had to carve out sometime to eat at a resturant i have wanted to eat at for sometime now but have never had the chance during my former business trips to chitown. located at the center of the magnificent mile, the purple pig is a must visit. it is small and you might find yourself sharing a table with strangers but if you are open minded it really is a cool vibe and totally worth getting aquinted to new people. i got lucky and was able to get seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen where all the magic happens. being able to watch the team put the flavorful plates together was an added bonus to my experience. voted one of america's best restaurants in  the purple pig exceeded my expectations. my party of two ordered the smashed potatoes, octopus a la plancha and the turkey leg confit . please note the plates are meant to be shared and omg it was more than enough food. let us just say each plate just got better as they came. it was as if my friend and i were making music with our yums and oh's and ah's and wow's of how delicious everything was. minimal talking was had as we were too busy stuffing our faces with such deliciousness! i was still a little hungover from the night before and had a flight to catch so i chose not to have a hair of the dog but they have an extensive wine list that i will absolutely try the next time i am in town. i will certainly be back! if you are looking for delicious reasonably priced food and a good time with awesome service, you must try the purple pig. one of my all time favorite restaurants in chitown."
1058,Michelle U.,1128,5,8/1/18,"came here on a monday during lunch and got lucky with no wait because i found seating at the bar. even at pm this place was crazy packed. as soon as you walk in, you can smell the amazing aromas because of the open kitchen layout. food is amazing. i highly recommend fried pig ears salad, turkey leg confit , and spare ribs. all three dishes were soooo flavorful. portions are also huge! definitely get a bang for your buck here. bartenders were very attentive even though it was crowded at the bar area. if i ever come back to chicago, this would be my top pick. i highly recommend you try this place. even if it seems packed, put your name down on the waiting list, go exploring around the area and come back! the food is worth the wait."
1059,Letty H.,1128,5,7/8/18,"a lot of people come here for the wine and cheese! the wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone here. i came for the food and i thought it was delicious! the food here is meant to be shared and that is what we did! we started with the calamari. for once, we got calamari that was not fried and i was not expecting to like it, but it was one of our favorite dishes! it comes cold and with plenty of flavor. it is a very refreshing dish and i recommend it. the roasted bone marrow was tasty! it comes with an herb salad and sea salt on the side. i like that we can add our own salt to the bone marrow and the herb salad was not bad! it had a lot of cilantro, which i am not too fond of, but the sauce really overpowered the cilantro so i could not taste much of it. next was the milk braised berkshire shoulder. it was soft but way too salty for us. the taste was a little heavy, especially with the mashed potatoes. lastly, we had the turkey leg confit  one of our favorites! it was delicious and the portion was huge! it did not have a bone in it and was so tender. the seasoning was delicious. overall, i enjoyed the different flavors here. it was unfamiliar yet delicious. i recommend if you are in the area!"
1060,Mindy D.,1128,4,6/17/18,"this is a hot spot for tourists and we were lucky to be seated right away at a community table with other strangers. the restuarant is located right next to the river with lovely views from where i sat on the patio. service was good. we decided on the grilled octopus my personal favorite!, turkey leg confit , and grilled broccoli. the octopus was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. it was paired with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. the broccoli was really tasty because of the anchovy vinaigrette, roasted garlic, and toasted bread crumbs on top. such a unique and exquisite way to eat broccoli! the turkey leg was probably the only item that did not wow me as because it did not seem much different than the turkey leg i can get at a fair. it was drenched in a sweet sauce, topped with lentils and came with bed of cabbage. i like the tapas style of this restaurant and there are other items on the menu i would come back to try like the roasted bone marrow."
1061,Elizaveta K.,1128,2,6/11/18,"could not hide my excitement  it was my first time at purple pig. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. we went sunday party of two, were immediately seated  so grateful we escaped the famous ' hour wait line'. ordered three dishes   octopus was absolutely phenomenal. perfectly cooked, tender with green beans,potatoes and salsa complementing the dish.  lentil salad  warm, healthy , tasty but a bit too acidic .  turkey leg confit is my least favorite dish, due to the marinade  was very much oversalted. our waiter seemed tired and demotivated. i asked for the grilled asparagus on the side, he said he does not think the kitchen can make it. this was he is answer, without much explanation. no matter how much i wish i could call this place 'exceptional ' it simply is not."
1062,Rick D.,1128,3,6/2/18,"we ordered the crispy pig ears with fried egg, octopus a la plancha, turkey leg confit , and grilled broccoli. we loved the crispy fried pig ears. i did not care for the marinade for the turkey leg confit but at least the turkey leg was very tender moist so that was nice. we did not care much for the flavor of the octopus a la plancha as a much as we thought we would, and did not like the grilled broccoli because it had too much of a vinegar flavor. rick d, san diego, ca."
1063,Courtney D.,1128,4,5/23/18,the food here is great. we ordered a bunch of things including the lentil salad which was yummy and the turkey leg confit which was also very good but soo big. only thing i did not like was the cramped seating. two of us were sat across from each other at the super long table in between two families. it was a super awkward set up and definitely took away from the experience.
1064,Christina X.,1128,3,4/29/18,"its usually a longer wait, but because we came here for a late lunch at around pm, there was no line. the place is usually bustling and is a nice place for friends to catch up over shared plates although it can get quite loud and difficult to hear one another. the food varied though, but here's what we had i would recommend the first  and skipping the last  . salt roasted beets with goat cheese & pistachio this was surprisingly good. very refreshing and the goat cheese provided a nice balance. . milk braised berkshire shoulder the pork shoulder was juicy and flavorful. the mashed potatoes and gravy that the dish came with was also very creamy and not too salty. . turkey leg confit  we were not a fan of this. i was expecting something similar to a duck confit , but was disappointed because the meat was much more stiff i guess this should have been expected given it is turkey . . grilled octopus this was recommended by our waiter, but i found that the octopus too be unnecessarily chewy and lacking flavor."
1065,Cameron M.,1128,3,12/26/17,"overrated. i was in chicago for business and wanted to escape restaurants in the loop, so met a chicagoan friend for a weeknight dinner. the restaurant was packed with a minute wait, but we happily put our name down and flipped through the nicely curated beverage menu. my friend, who frequented the purple pig in the past, was excited for me to try the turkey leg confit and pork shoulder. we were seated at a communal table across from a trumpesque brazenly creepy drunk dude, reminding me of my hatred for communal tables, and struggled to keep our plates from getting mixed up with other patrons' plates. the wait staff had to keep reaching around and over us to service the other guests who were along the window. octopus, turkey leg confit , something green that was not memorable, and the pork shoulder. salty. everything was freakishly oversalted! the pork shoulder arrived near room temperature, so we had to send it back i have only sent something back for being cold once before in my life at a red robin burger joint, so no snobbiness here and the same pork shoulder returned resauced and heated to warm. turkey leg confit was simply too salty to continue eating, although the surrounding veggies were crisp and flavorful. the octopus was fine, but of lower quality. this meal left me wishing for something exciting to remember it by. i suggest you order the octopus and other mediterranean fare at nearby restaurant ƒíma and skip the purple pig. sorry chef jimmy bannos jr.!"
1066,Jackie H.,1128,5,11/1/17,"oh, if only it was not so popular! people know about the purple pig. off of michigan, but just far off enough, there is a mystical swine restaurant on a patio. inside, you will be told there is at least an hour wait, and when they text you, you have  minutes exactly to return to your table. mission accepted. quite crowded, tables really close together. the wait staff is knowledgeable and gave some great recs. started off with a beer  and looked over the menu which is separated into categories, snacks, panini, crisp and fried, pasta, offal, pork, etc. plates are large, tapas style sharing. great flavors, lots of options. we had the following fried pizza neapolitan  seemed like a carnival fried dough average with amazing ingredients on top i ended up just picking off the mozzarella, pesto, corn, and delightful preserved tomatoes. delicious toppings, but i guess i do not like fried food as mcuh as i thought. the beloved braised pork shoulder  definitely a hit of this swine joint. large pork shoulder on a smear of delicious mashed potatoes. pork falls off with the touch of a fork, very savory, slightly salty, but must share with a friend. very intense flavors. turkey leg confit  with crispy lentils, cabbage.... would not get again. reminded me of the huge turkey leg you would get at an amusement park, nothing really special about it. i hear the menu is seasonal and i would go back to try some of the interesting veggies they offered and the roasted bone marrow everyone talks about. in sum if you can get in through the doors, you will enjoy yourself."
1067,Zemin H.,1128,4,10/22/17,"we are from out of town, based on word of mouth and yelp review we chose this one for lunch. we ordered  dishesentries for  people. but quantity is less than expected for all dishes. so we ended up with ordering additional  dishes. pig ear is so so, bone marrow is good too, smoked pig tongue is very tasty, i also like the octopus which normally tastes like rubber, finally the turkey leg confit with good quantity is very tender. overall, it is bit on salty side, my wife thinks that all the dishes are too salty. our waiter was very helpful, he knew all the popular menu choices. so we spent  including tip for  people for lunch. because of its prime location close to well known chicago tribune building, if you want a quality food, there is not much choice."
1068,Jordan Y.,1128,5,10/18/17,"weird stuff, in the best way possible. pork shoulder, broccoli and the turkey leg confit were all on point. perfect temperature, texture and flavor. this place certainly lived up to the hype!"
1069,Matthew C.,1128,3,8/16/17,"came here on two occasions over the past month. the wait was short for early dinner pm while it was around  minutes for late dinner pm. however, the food was not worth the hype. i have tried the pork liver plate, roasted bone marrow, pig's ear, turkey leg confit , milk braised pork shoulders, and octopus with green beans. all of them were well made with the freshest ingredients, but every dish was overly salty. it was as if the chef had no idea of how much salt he was putting in. and this happened both times i went. this should not be happening at a michelin guide restaurant."
1070,Alice W.,1128,4,8/15/17,"strolling down michigan avenue, i saw the purple pig from across the street and recalled having saved it in my yelp bookmarks. within minutes, we crossed over and got the last two seats at the bar for a late lunch. we ordered  grilled broccoli with roasted garlic and toasted breadcrumbs in an anchovy vinaigrette   ricotta gnocchi with spring onion pesto, peas, and fava beans in a neck bone gravy   milk braised berkshire shoulder with mashed potatoes and puffed farro  the broccoli and ricotta gnocchi were fantastic. my favorite was definitely the gnocchi. i especially liked the anchovy vinaigrette and neck bone gravy that accompanied the respective dishes  wonderful sauces! the shoulder was unfortunately a bit dry and the puffed farro was not cooked all the way, so that was a bit disappointing. we lamented later that we should have ordered the bone marrow. the dishes overall have great flavor, although the menu feels like it is doing a lot. everything from cheeses to panini to crispy pig's ears, pork tongue, housecured sardines, grilled octopus, blade steak, and turkey leg confit . this is a super, super popular restaurant. we were lucky to get seats without reservations. the space is extremely tight, so be prepared if you are claustrophobic. i was shoulder to shoulder with my bf and a nice stranger. still, well worth a visit if you are in chitown and like the shareable tapas concept among close friends."
1071,Paul W.,1128,2,7/31/17,"pretty disappointing. had the calamari, broccoli, heirloom tomatoes, and turkey leg confit . broccoli had good flavor but overcooked, calamari was good but overdressed in lemon, heirloom tomatoes nothing to write home about. what was really disappointing, actually disgusting, was the turkey leg confit . tasted like they poured a bottle of vinegar in it. i guess it is good if you like food soaked in vinegar. the waiter recommended it and when i asked the waiter about it and he just shrugged it off and said it is suppose to taste like vinegar. who the hell tries to make their food taste like pure vinegar?"
1072,Lin C.,1128,4,7/13/17,"i walk by this place almost every day and it never occurred to me to check it out. my friends from reno,nv was raving about how this was a must try on their list. i was fortunate enough to have joined them on a spur of the moment happy hour  we missed our chicago architectural tour. we popped in on a monday afternoon around  pm and was promptly welcomed by the hostess. we were seated outside by the river to really enjoy and appreciate the beauty of chicago summer. service was fast, friendly, and love it when they mind snapping a few photos for you. we ordered the turkey leg confit and the roasted bone marrow, and paired our food with sangria. i love that you can tell when a chef puts a lot of thought into the food. you can visually see it in the plating of the food, taste it in the flavors, and how it is paired with the drinks."
1073,Amanda B.,1128,5,7/12/17,"came here with my mom and one of her friends while they were visiting chicago. came at about  on a monday in order to get in with minimal wait. lunch had been a little late that day so we were not entirely stuffed, but wanted to come here prior to a show. were promptly seated at the communal table inside. upon ordering wine, the waitress was able to recommend a chardonnay that we all were very pleased with. ordered a soft cheese with jam on crackers that was to die for. also hummus and pitas basic but delicious. next came out the roasted carrots and plantains and omg! the only thing we were not entirely pleased with was the tuscan kale caesar salad, it was too much dressing for the lettuce. for an entree, we split the turkey leg confit . so good!!! dessert was some sort of mascarpone cheesecake and it was unreal!! as i said, we were not starving upon coming so this was the perfect amount of food for  people. warning the seating is very close together and you are likely to be placed at one of  communal tables this could ruin your dinner, my mom was very surprised by it but then enjoyed the way you could chat with your neighbors but also enjoy private conversation if you please."
1074,Sneha N.,1128,4,7/7/17,throwback to vacay time in chicago when i had a ball at this famous tapas bar! they say food must please all your senses! and these delicacies sure did! we started off with this lovely rose sangria paired with fried deviled eggs served with arugula and caper berries! followed by striped bass with fig wrapped in pasta and served with a drizzling of the freshest olive oil i have ever tasted! the highlight of the dinner was definitely the  turkey leg confit  served with crispy lentils and potatoes the meat was outstandingly tender and juicy! we had the caramel panna cotta for dessert which was a disappointment compared to the main course. tapas bars have become my thing lately and these pictures should tell you why do try out this place if you end up visiting chicago! #ezeechef #ezeetraveltimes #chicago #restaurantreview
1075,Mandy F.,1128,4,7/4/17,"wait  minutes on a sunday for  bobota greek cornbread   honestly was not worth the  and all four of us did not really find it any special from any other cornbread grilled broccoli   ten bucks is definitely a steep for a bowl of brocolli but it was pretty good caesar   probably one of the best caesar salads i have had. i loved the quail egg topping for this salad! calamari   this was pretty good. tasted really refreshing and summery! grilled octopus   i was super excited about this order, but it was such a small order. there were maybe like  or  pieces of octopus which sucked for the price we were paying. roasted bone marrow   bone marrow with bread. nothing too crazy but you should order it if you are interested in trying it or like bone barrow! chicken thigh kebabs  this was eh turkey leg confit   this is nothing like the turkey leg you get at theme parks. the turkey meat came right off the bone and was super good ! i was really full at this point but i still tried to get a few more bites of this before i finally gave up. drinks  the alcoholic drinks are a must!"
1076,Frank T.,1128,5,10/24/18,"good restaurant and a varied menu.the salt  roasted beets is a perfect starter.the chicken kebabs are unique.nice beer and wine list. the host and the drink server were friendly and had a good attitude. all delicious. great service, great food.this place is a must if you are looking for incredible food."
1077,Rita G.,1128,5,10/8/18,my sister wanted me to experience this menu. i am so happy she insisted. the salt roasted beets were excellent. razor clams were good but the pork shoulder stole the show. excellent wine list. service terrific. love the portion size. cannot wait to go back. so many choices. one of the best menus i have experienced. love the tap size portions!
1078,Katarzyna S.,1128,4,9/25/18,"we visited on a saturday and the place seemed very busy. luckily we were willing to sit at a table with strangers, therefore we were seated right away. we enjoyed exploring a unique menu. we got the bone marrow and salt  roasted beets . i loved the combination of breadbone marrow salt cilantro. it was delicious. beets were good too, would have never thought to put pistachios on my beets so that was a unique dish."
1079,Hayley B.,1128,5,9/23/18,"the purple pig has been a longtime favorite spot of mine and after many years it continues to impress. in fact, my latest visit was my best yet. i went here for lunch with a group of four and we split a bottle of ros, and one order of the salt  roasted beets , whipped feta, chicken thigh kebabs, and octopus. it was the perfect amount for four people, and we were all silent when the food it the table because we were so busy eating. though we thoroughly enjoyed each dish, the table favorite was the chicken thigh kebabs  the combo of the crispy smashed potatoes, and deliciously creamy tzatziki sauce was to die for. this is a great spot to share small plates with friends, just arrive early and plan to wait for a table  they do the whole we will text you when we are ready deal so you can shop while you wait for your turn."
1080,Christopher M.,1128,5,9/4/18,"one visit to the purple pig is simply not enough to give it a proper review. i barely scratched the surface of what the menu has to offer, and even with the three items i ordered i was completely overwhelmed with how outstanding the food was. one caveat  i did not order the pork shoulder i know, i know. i was not that hungry and i knew that would put me over the edge. the pork fat roasted almonds were unbelievably delicious, do not hesitate to start your meal off with those babies. the salt  roasted beets are the absolute way to go after that, my goodness. light, fluffy, perfect. i thought the mortadella was just ok, but that being the only dish i tried that was even slightly disappointing speaks volumes to the overall quality here. i want to come back as soon as possible and try every single thing on the menu. great vibe, fun and festive atmosphere. phenomenal."
1081,Lynette P.,1128,5,8/26/18,everything was great!! cannot wait to visit again next time i am in chicago. the salt roasted beets were delicious. we had  other dishes that were also delicious but i do not recall their names because they were ordered by other people. we did not have to wait to be seated at  pm on a weekday.
1082,Ivonnie S.,1128,4,8/19/18,"yum. several people recommend i check out this place when visiting chicago, and i am so glad i had the chance to drop by before leaving! we came here about  minutes before their weekday opening lunch time and were the first in line. soon after, the restaurant began filling up with lunch patrons  a mixture of families and business people. as many others have mentioned, all of the plates are meant to be shared tapasstyle, so bring a dining buddy or five so you can try more dishes! my friend and i shared  salt  roasted beets  favorite dish, no questions asked. allcaps because it was really that good. the presentation was lovely, and the flavors & textures all worked together so well  sweet, savory, a little acidity tender beets with some crunchy pistachio bits and creamy, fluffy whipped goat cheese... okay, maybe i just really like beets , dairy, and nut butters, so this was like the perfect dish to me haha. as long as you do not outright hate all of the above or even if you do, have someone else order it and snag a bite  maybe you will change your mind, give this dish a try!  eggplant caponata close runnerup to the salt  roasted beets . again, all of the flavors worked really well together the bread was delightfully crunchy, and the olive oil added a nice freshness.  octopus a la plancha this was highlyrated by a lot of people, but honestly i have had better octopus elsewhere. nevertheless, it was nicely grilled and very meaty. green beans were meh. i did not really like the salsa verde it had a strong mint flavor.  milkbraised berkshire pork shoulder the meat was super tender for sure, and overall this was a good dish but it did not wow me like the beets and eggplant caponata. my friend commented that it reminded her of thanksgiving dinner flavors, especially with the mashed potatoes. also, i am not sure if it was just our table, but the service was pretty brisk for it being a pricier restaurant. is shoving aside plates and water glasses upon bringing a new dish typical? at least the guy refilling water smiled. not basing this review on the service, but it would be a  or maybe even a  when i look at our meal's bill. i will still recommend this place to others because the beets and eggplant were ahmazing, but perhaps not the octopus or pork shoulder. the scallops at the table next to us did look tasty though and the two ladies raved about how good they were!"
1083,Lisa G.,1128,5,7/9/18,"visiting here from connecticut, went for lunch, and it was an amazing experience. my spouse and i shared the house cured olives, salt roasted beets , crispy pig ears, and ricotta filled gnocchi.  the beets were incredible, served with whipped goat cheese and pistachios. the combination of sweet and salty was perfect. the pig ears were accompanied by hot peppers, kale and a fried egg, and were just as good as the beets . but our favorite had to be the gnocchi, which was served with the best sauce i have ever tasted. the service was impeccable, with our server appearing at the perfect times. would definitely recommend and will definitely be visiting again before we leave."
1084,Johanna L.,1128,5,6/27/18,"my favorite restaurant on the mag mile and probably river north. there will be a wait but it is so worth it.  if the salt roasted beets are on the menu when you go, you have to order them. they are the best beets i have ever eaten. i also like that they offer several sizes of wine and their list is extensive.  the only downside to this place is that there are  restrooms for the entire restaurant i feel so bad for the staff because they have to stand in line too  so do not wait until you really need to go because you could be in line for awhile."
1085,Steve S.,1128,5,6/12/18,wow.. what a gastro indulgence of amazing food. you must have the peanut butter and fluff dessert. salt roasted beets were excellent as well as the pickled potato croquette. sharing is a must to explore more of the menu.. enjoy!!
1086,hank t.,1128,5,5/21/18,"it is a cold and wet chicago eve and we were told not to miss this place. so we put it in the gps and started to walk. for such a popular place i do not know why the gps could not hone in. so i called for directions and sure enough we had been walking the wrong way. finally there we found out that the wait was . hrs. took one look at the food constantly coming out of the kitchen, so there was only one choice, to wait. then we saw a table for two in the covered outside area and we are told it is close to the door so might be cold. saw the overhead heaters, took a temp test and decided to go for it. well, it was not unbearable and it helped keep the wine at the proper temp but it sure beat the alternative long wait. i would have to caution you to come hungry and be adventurous. even if you think you know the ingredients, the way chef jimmy incorporates them is not what you would expect. so ask your server as they know all the answers as they have to learn each dish. quit frankly, that is a lot of things to remember especially since the menu changes frequently . okay, do not miss the fried pig ears  but you really do not need the fried egg as the star of the dish are prepared perfectly and the kale and pickled jalapeo accent perfectly. we also had the salt roasted beets with whipped feta, fried sweet potato polenta with whipped burrata and duck fat poached radish  at least three diff types and oh yes, green pea hummus with a poached egg. we tried the razor clams and after tasting them found the flavor was wonderful but the clam was over cooked. the server immediately removed them and apologized. the chef apologized to us, too. really nice. time for dessert. you must leve room as the culinary wizardry just gets better. we had the greek sundae  yes, on a cold chicago eve and the vanilla bean truffles ice cream choc sandwich. omg!! neither not to be missed. all this was enjoyed with a really nice chianti reserva from the multi region voluminous wine book. not bad for two people but with a bigger group you can experience even more dishes. be warned, they do not take reservations or call aheads. good eating!!!!"
1087,Elizabeth N.,1128,3,5/5/18,"we ordered the english muffin  truffle sausage, salt  roasted beets , grilled octopus, and olive oil poached tuna. the beets and grilled octopus was very good. the sauces cooked with the beets worked very well. the texture of the octopus was not too firm or too soft. the olive oil poached was seriously lacking flavor. the english muffin  truffle sausage is basically a fancy sausage egg mcmuffin which there is is nothing wrong with that but it was not better than the ones at the golden arches."
1088,Christina X.,1128,3,4/29/18,"its usually a longer wait, but because we came here for a late lunch at around pm, there was no line. the place is usually bustling and is a nice place for friends to catch up over shared plates although it can get quite loud and difficult to hear one another. the food varied though, but here's what we had i would recommend the first  and skipping the last  . salt roasted beets with goat cheese & pistachio this was surprisingly good. very refreshing and the goat cheese provided a nice balance. . milk braised berkshire shoulder the pork shoulder was juicy and flavorful. the mashed potatoes and gravy that the dish came with was also very creamy and not too salty. . turkey leg confit we were not a fan of this. i was expecting something similar to a duck confit, but was disappointed because the meat was much more stiff i guess this should have been expected given it is turkey. . grilled octopus this was recommended by our waiter, but i found that the octopus too be unnecessarily chewy and lacking flavor."
1089,Mark N.,1128,5,4/27/18,absolutely outstanding food here. the salt  roasted beets is a perfect starter. with whipped goat cheese and an amazing pistachio butter you will get an array of awesome flavors and textures. the chicken kebabs are unique. they use thigh meat instead of breast meat. the fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki that come with it perfectly rounds out the dish. we finished with the housemade meatballs with green garlic and toasted brioch. lots and lots of flavor here. the meatballs were perfectly cooked. nice beer and wine list. service was great.
1090,Amy D.,1128,4,1/31/18,"cute tapas style restaurant with a lot of inventive dishes in downtown chicago. they do not take reservations, so come early to avoid waiting in line! they were pretty busy at noon on a friday, and since we came a few minutes before, we were able to grab one of the last tables for a party of . it was partially communal seating, since we sat at one end of a larger table, but there were some empty seats between the two parties. they have an extensive menu, and portion sizes vary between the dishes. we tried  salt roasted beets whipped goat cheese, pistachio butter, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  yum i love beets , and they roasted the beets perfectly. it went well with the whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter, and this was a huge serving recommended! stuffed squid prosciutto, breadcrumbs, santorini fava pure, charmoula, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  the squid is nice and tender, and this dish was very flavorful. i do not eat very salty, so this dish was borderline salty for me. crispy pig's ear kale, pickled cherry peppers, fried egg, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  the crispy pig's ears were sliced a little too thinly for me, but it had a good crisp. i wish they added more flavors to the pig's ears instead of a fried egg, since that did not do anything for this dish. however, the kale was delicious, and super crispy. this dish is worth trying once. fried pizza neapolitan bufala mozzarella, radicchio, fig, balsamic, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  this dish looked and sounded amazing, but the fried pizza dough was very plain. the ingredients did not quite come together for me, and i probably would not order this again. housemade meatballs green garlic, ricotta, toasted brioche, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  solid meatballs, and they were softfluffy on the inside with a nice sear on the outside. lots of flavors going on here recommended! chorizo stuffed olives , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  these were way too salty for me it was salt on salt . skip! fried polenta & mozzarella prosciutto, pistachio, mint pesto, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  yum i liked this bite since all the ingredients worked well together. recommended! milk braised berkshire pork shoulder mashed potatoes, puffed farro, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  this pork shoulder was so tender the meat flaked off with your fork, and almost melted in your mouth. i wish they served the pork with something other than mashed potatoes so that the dish has more texture. i would have preferred this served on top of pasta instead. service was awesome, and our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. the food comes out really quickly, and we received all our dishes within  minutes of ordering. i would highly recommend coming here with a small group so that you can sample a lot of different dishes."
1091,Michelle R.,1128,5,1/29/18,"great food! each dish had a beautiful presentation and they were full of flavors. we had whipped feta, fried polenta and mozzarella , and salt roasted beets . as soon as one dish was finished the next one arrived."
1092,Emily C.,1128,5,1/22/18,i arrived  minutes before it was even open and there was already a long line! i sat in the communal tables which was a little tight space but was not too terrible. my group ordered the salt  roasted beets . i am not a fan off goat cheese and beets but my friends are and they loved it. we also had the hummus which was sooooo good. i really like how they added the soft boiled egg. the crispy pig ears and grilled octopus was very good also. there was a special steak that day so we ordered it and it was yummy!!! the milk braised berkshire shoulder was so tender if fell off the bone. that is how good it was. definitely worth coming here even if there is a long wait.
1093,Danielle G.,1128,3,11/13/17,"i have had purple pig bookmarked since my first trip to chicago, but did not get to visit until recently. i have heard such fantastic things about the food here from friends with trusted palates. when we first checked in, we were told . hour wait. they have a nice system that will text when it is closer to the table being ready. we got that text about an hour after waiting and had  minutes to check in. we were seated at a shared hightop table. we ordered and shared everything family style  salt  roasted beets with whipped goat cheese  pistachio butter my favorite dish here. i am a huge fan of beets in general. they are clean, colorful, and really well complimented by the goat cheese and pistachio butter. wait, backup.. pistachio butter. who knew that was a thing? but it is a very, very good thing. i was the girl licking the plate clean of it. broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs  anchovy vinaigrette what better way to make broccoli less broccolilike than to smother it with garlic and breadcrumbs. solid side dish. milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes  puffed farro the boys in my group loved this dish, but i actually thought it was way too salty. the meat was extra tender, but i just could not handle the sodium level on this one so the boys got extras.  roasted bone marrow with herb salad  sicilian sea salt  oh hello, fatty bone marrow. this dish is decadent and does just enough to please the tastebuds. cured meats and cheese platter, chef's choice a great platter for sharing. we were able to try a lot of variety with this one. the ambiance is a bit chaotic, but the servers were able to deliver our food in a fairly efficient manner and cleanup was even faster. soo, the beets and the bone marrow are winners. but i really wish i had been wowed by the purple pig, and i was not. i do think some of the dishes being overly salted was a big turnoff for me."
1094,Jeanne T.,1128,5,10/7/17,"i am visiting from ny and this place was recommended to me by several friends and they did not disappoint! i had a party of  and we ordered  dishes,  cheeses and a bottle of wine. majaority of the plates are moderate size, decent for sharing and getting your satisfaction for each palate. we ordered  grilled broccoli  i love broccoli to begin with so this may be a bit bias, however i think everyone should get this. it is so good! broccoli was perfectly cooked and charred. the dressing was creamy and tangy. do not be put off by the anchovy, you cannot taste the fishiness.  grilled octopus  i wish there was more octopus! this was also really good. the octopus was very tender, not at all chewy. the green beans and the potatoes were cooked and held onto the sauce very well.  crispy pig ears  a group favorite!! super crispy and flavorful, a little on the salty side but we did not mind! oh and the crispy kale was also bomb dot com.  chorizo stuffed olive  i am personally not a fan of olives sorry! been told i am weird for this. just does not suite my palate however do not fret! according to my counterparts it was really good but also really really salty. the olive itself is salty not because of the chorizo. nonetheless the plate was devoured.  salt roasted beets  yummmmmm!!! i love beets ! this was also a crowd favorite. the goat cheese is whipped so it is not as pungent but you definitely still taste that stinkiness. lol  milk braised berkshire pork shoulder  honestly, could have done without this dish. nothing special really. pork shoulder was cooked well, it was moist and juicy but would not miss it.  pork steak chop ?  the salad on the side was very tangy from the vinaigrette however it complemented the pork very well because as you keep eating the chop you notice the saltiness building up. the chop was well flavored and juicy and big! at this point we were oddly still kinda hungry so we had planned to get a pasta dish....but it was dinner time! they switched us over to the dinner menu and it was a little upsetting since there was not as many pasta dish choices. we ended getting heirloom tomato fritters instead.  heirloom tomato fritters one of my favorites!! the tomatoes were so sweet and juicy and very refreshing. super yummy. the service was good as well, very busy place."
1095,Adolfo P.,1128,5,9/24/18,"excelente lugar, muy concurrido. espere  min por una mesa un sbado en la noche. sin embargo mientras esperaba la mesa pedi unos tragos y la espera fue agradable. para cenar pedi el pork shoulder que estuvo fenomenal, mi esposa pidi el octopus grill que tampoco decepcion.... de postre el sicilian iris .... celestial! lo recomiendo ampliamente."
1096,Andy P.,1128,4,9/2/18,this is a great place to eat if you are in chicago. there is so many items on the menu but we only get to try  dishes. the grilled squid was so tender and flavorful with a taste of lime. the pork shoulder was great but it is a lot of meat. would be better to include some veggies along with it. and lastly the dessert sicilian iris is great. like a fancier version of funnel cake.
1097,Ally K.,1128,5,8/18/18,"words cannot describe the euphoric experience that is the purple pig. just go go go!!! i admit i am a little biased because mediterranean style tapas are kind of my jam, but i digress. particularly memorable dishes include the sicilian iris , the octopus a la plancha, and especially the polenta with ricotta and passion fruit. the braised pork shoulder was so unbelievably tender i was a bit skeptical if it was really pork shoulder....ha! unlike most tapas places, the dishes are large enough that you will not feel like you are fighting with your group for more than a tiny bite from each dish. i went home with a full satisfied belly. win!!! lastly we got a great recommendation from our waitress on some red wine. the easy day drinking variety, perfect for our sunday brunch, and a new favorite, despite being one of the cheapest on the menu i will say that here you will find most bottles priced at over  dollars....mehhh. but! you can tell they put a lot of thought into the wine at purple pig, our red was served slightly chilled which i have learned over the years is the proper way to serve a bottle of red, but most restaurants just do not do this. all in all, if my review and the thousands of others have not convinced you yet, just please eat here. you will not regret it!"
1098,Marcella K.,1128,5,8/2/18,this is my first time in a chicago and all my friends have been recommending purple pig as the best restaurant to go to in chicago! this place did not disappoint. my brother and i were super tired from going to skydeck  waiting for that instagrammable photo! this place closes late and we went in at  pm. we were so excited because it was our last night in chicago and thought we could not try it but we made it! all the dishes were amazing.. but our favorite was the dessert. our server recommended the sicilian iris which tasted like chocolate chip cookie heaven!! i do not like super sweet desserts but this was the icing on the cake! it tasted like a doughnut filled with chocolatey goodness would recommend coming here again!
1099,Frances L.,1128,4,6/21/18,"we were lucky to get seated at the purple pig quickly as the place got way busier at  pm. following the yelpers, we started off with the bone marrow appetizer. it comes with buttered pieces of bread and you spread the bone marrow with salad and sea salt. it was unique and buttery.  next, we ordered the grilled octopus, which came with fingerling potatoes and green beans in a pesto sauce. the octopus was soft and had a slight charred crispiness from the grill. delicious!  my favorite was the milk braised pork shoulder. when they brought it out, i wondered where the knife was. but turns out, you do not need it, because the shoulder is so tender, it falls apart as you scoop it out withe a spoon with the mashed potatoes.  of course, even stuffed, we could not resist trying the sicilian iris dessert which is a lot like a donut with ricotta and chocolate inside. it is rich, but still tasted pretty good.  service was decent, but the atmosphere is a little too loud and like a bar for me. a great place to try, if you want something unique!"
1100,Lihan C.,1128,5,6/14/18,"i regularly visit purple pig as the location is so conveniently located. i have tried a variety of things and i find myself always getting the bone marrow appetizer. i think the dish used to be a little bit less salty, but i still enjoy it with the bread although i use very little salt if any at all that they provide. i also enjoy the razor clams, it is nicely flavored with a bit of lemon and olive oil. the milk braised pork shoulder although not my jam it is a bit heavy for my tastes with the mashed potato and milk sauce is delicious for a lot of other people that i have brought with the pork shoulder being so tender and braised that it falls apart and sort of melts in your mouth for pork anyway a great comfort food. other standouts that i have had include the chicken kebabs with the chicken being perfectly tender and the tzatziki sauce really adding to it with a mediterranean taste. the rotating desserts are always a delight too. my favorite by far is this pistachio creme brulee i have had in the past, but as i said rotating. i hope purple pig brings this back because i dream about having it again all the time and i do not even like pistachios!! of course the sicilian iris is always a classic, sometimes when their chef is not it in they will not make it though? it takes roughly  minutes or so they say, usually it comes out faster and is well worth the wait with the ooey gooey chocolate and ricotta. so comfy and delicious. i have also had something similar to the current blackout cake, not sure what it is now but a dark chocolate cake with a hazelnut hard candy piece that was delicious as well! my friends and i frequently also have cocktails here and they taste great as well. i always have several people walk up saying i will have what she is having when i have cocktails after work because they look so tasty! all in all a great place in terms of location, variety in food because they rotate with the seasons and are always trying new things! got to have what you like before it rotates out and is gone forever  like that pistachio creme brulee..."
1101,Adaria T.,1128,5,6/1/18,"this is my first time in chicago, and this was the first restaurant that my husband and i ate at. i absolutely loved it! to be honest, i am not sure if i have eaten better food elsewhere, and i am from california. first off, the atmosphere is great. it was crowded with people, all the servers were super friendly and sweet, we could see the bar and the kitchen from where we sat, and the decor was pretty cool as well. secondly, i love the whole idea behind the restaurant. here you have amazing mediterranean dishes that are served tapas style. i thought that was great! my husband and i ordered several items to share between the two of us, and it was the perfect amount of food green chickpea  hummus, deviled egg, housemade gyros under the meat section, and ricotta gnocchi. for dessert, we had a sicilian iris , and i enjoyed a coffee drink called carajillo. so yummy!!! if you are ever in the chicago area, i highly recommend this place! i am pretty sure you will not be disappointed. if my husband and i come back to chicago, this place is a must on our list!"
1102,Charlene S.,1128,4,5/7/18,"i was super excited to try the purple pig for lunch and i was mostly impressed! i got to the restaurant about  minutes before they opened to ensure that i would get seated. the roasted bone marrow with herb salad and sicilian sea salt was delicious without being too greasy. the large bone was served with several pieces of thick crunchy bread, some greens, and sea salt. a spoonful of that bone marrow with that bread, and i was in heaven! we were basically fighting over the last pieces of that bone marrow! the fava bean spread was pretty average. a few pieces of bread with some spread, which basically tasted like hummus. i would not get again. crispy pig's ears was not my favorite dish. i thought the entire dish was too greasy, but i did enjoy the blend of veggies kale and peppers, along with the perfectly fried runny egg. i would not get again. the grilled octopus came with fingerling potatoes, green beans and salsa verde. the octopus was super tender and perfectly cooked, though the entire dish was too salty. all of the individual components were salty, as was the salsa verde, which made everything too salty. the milk braised berkshire shoulder with mashed potatoes and puffed farro was absolutely incredible! the meat was so tender and basically fell apart in my mouth. as a lover of mashed potatoes, i was happy that these were creamy and not lumpy. i am generally not a big fan of desserts but knew i had to try the sicilian iris , which was a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. cutting open the dessert was glorious, and the taste matched the appearance just as well. i loved how creamy the filling was without being too sweet. purple pig is so close to  stars for me, but some of the dishes were just too salty and oily for my liking. i would definitely come back for the pork shoulder and bone marrow!"
1103,Raiyan D.,1128,5,2/27/18,"i went to the purple pig for the first time ever last week, and this was one of the best all around dining experiences i have had in a long time. excellent food that is very reasonably priced and tops most upper echelon places. be aware of the fact that they do not take any reservations, so if you want to get a table or have a party larger than , you should try and get there sooner rather than later. my girlfriend and i opted to sit at the bar because it opened up quicker but if you do decide to wait, they have a standing room only, heated outdoor patio where you can get drinks and food while you wait. in terms of food, we ordered the brussel sprouts, duck gargenelli, and ossobuco  they all were hits. for dessert, we ordered the chocolate blackout cake, and the sicilian iris , and both were delicious but if i had to pick one, i would say go with the sicilian iris . the menu can be overwhelming at times because there are so many random food pairings and combinations that you would not expect, but based on my meal, i think you cannot go wrong with anything they have. also, the staff is so amazing, and are ready to give you the best recommendations whether that is food or wine. definitely, go with the intention of sharing plates so you can experience as much of the menu as possible!"
1104,Phoebe L.,1128,3,2/22/18,"we went in the purple pig for late dinner. people here were very friendly and helpful. i recommend getting a table though you may have to wait a bit rather than standing. we thought the food was exotic, very different from what we have tried before. recommend the octopus salad, pig ears, pork shoulders, and especially sicilian iris for desert! we did not like the bone marrow though do not know why it is a popular dish. we ordered  dishes and  desert for  people and it was really really filling! recommend getting  dishes for  people keep in mind that though it says only  on yelp but it is   i would recommend it if you want to try new things ^^"
1105,Ivy L.,1128,5,1/28/18,"after a disappointing brunch in another restaurant in chicago, we decided to give the purple pig a shot to see if it can restore our faith in chicago cuisine. we are proud to give the purple pig an a for the following reasons  the broccoli dish is exquisite, elegant, and pleasing to the palate. the flavors are expertly balanced.  the pork shoulder has amazing gravy that perfectly compliments the tender meat. this dish is worth the money and fills you up to the brim of your soul.  the sicilian iris is heaven on earth in your mouth. the chocolate and ricotta filling is to die for. even my friend, an unenthusiastic cheese eater, was able to finish her share of this delicious gem.  last but not least, shout out to our server troy. not only did he stop by frequently to check up, he also graciously cut the sicilian iris for us clumsy fools. his cut was so perfect, we were able to take beautiful dessert pictures for social media. troy is always smiling and his service is the cherry on top  no  the entire sundae to our purple pig experience. we salute you, troy. you are the real mvp, the goat."
1106,edmond t.,1128,5,1/27/18,"i have been wanting to try the purple pig for years, so when my wife and i visited chicago for a weekend getaway, we jumped at the opportunity. we did not have reservations which was not an issue since they have standup tables on their covered patio, complete with full service. we order drinks and waited for about a half an hour until our table was ready. they are a tapas style restaurant, so we shared the butternut squash empanadas, the gnocchi, the pork belly, and finished our meal with the sicilian iris . everything was amazing! the empanadas were fried to perfection, the gnocchi were heavenly pillows, and the pork belly melted in your mouth! the sicilian iris was a rich and decadent way to finish our meal! the entire experience was a wonderful way to kick off our chicago weekend getaway!"
1107,Helen H.,1128,5,12/12/17,"my friend and i arrived at pm on a friday and were seated immediately at a communal table. the entrance is confusing because you go through a door and then through another door. it is almost like you went in the back way. it is more of a family style restaurant. troy, our waiter, recommended  dishes between the  of us. we ordered the polenta cake appetizer, grouper, ribeye, and sicilian iris dessert. grouper was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a nice mustardy tang to it. ribeye was cooked medium rare more on the rare side and it was so soft that a knife was not necessary. there are two types of sauces so make sure to try both. the white sauce had the rice which gave it nice texture when you took bites. i thought the highlight of our meal was the dessert though. sicilian iris tasted almost like a masalada fried donut that i had in hawaii. the dessert comes hot so be careful with that first bite. it was a delicious mix of chocolate and ricotta on the inside. highly recommend! you have got to try this one. it is a generous size so i would recommend to share. after dessert, we were stuffed. we could have gone without either the appetizer or dessert and have been perfectly content. troy was so helpful providing us excellent recommendations for appetizer and dessert."
1108,Reenu F.,1128,4,11/6/17,been here a few times and have really enjoyed the experience. the brussels sprouts and the chicken kebab were excellent. for dessert we tried a few items and would highly recommend the sicilian iris .
1109,Akemi L.,1128,5,10/23/17,"omg! this restaurant is so good! i heard of this place before and just had to try it while we are visiting chicago. we had the seafood sagakada which had large shrimps, mussels, fish and something like calamari. the tomato sauce was very tasty  almost like a thick cioppino but different. we also had the milk braised pork shoulder. the meat is so tender and flavorful. we saw the reviews on the sicilian iris and had to try it. my husband ate  of it as i am gluten intolerant. but this decadent ricotta and chocolate chip filled brioche was worth cheating on wheat."
1110,Natasha D.,1128,5,9/22/17,"what a place!! always busy, but the food is to die for. pro tip go put your name down at least three to four hours before you plan to have dinner then walk around downtown chicago until your wait time is over. i visited with a group of  over labor day weekend and we were able to sit together after almost a fourhour wait. i am a vegetarian and was a little skeptical about the options for me, given the namesake, but there were so many great options! order the gnocchi!! i also had the summer squash salad and beets. so so good. the desserts are also quite incredible. sicilian iris  ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche...literally one of the best desserts i have ever had!!"
1111,Melissa N.,1128,5,8/5/17,"the food and service was amazing! we started with octopus app and broccoli, followed by the lamb sausage kabobs, pork shoulder and gnocchi. everything was delicious! we finished our meal with the sicilian iris dessert. great choice!"
1112,Rick L.,1128,5,7/26/17,"the purple pig restaurant is reason enough on its own to visit chicago. we are from los angeles but find ourselves in chicago once a year for a couple nights ahead of a nearby conference we attend. we discovered the purple pig by accident during our first visit when we attempted to visit a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant across the street that happened to be closed for remodeling. the purple pig sign across the street was inviting...let us see what is over there i said to my wife after it became a reality that we would not be eating at a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant. we have returned every year and the purple pig has become the one given thing that we will do on every visit to chicago. on this particular visit, everything that came out of the kitchen looked gorgeous, like super artsy yummy comfort food, and the looks of joy on people's faces when their food arrived at their tables were pretty universal. they have extensive wine, beer, aperitifs, liqueurs and cocktails classic and house menus. i had the green acres cocktail egg white, chocolate bitters, tequila. it had extraordinary texture and was very well mixed. i also opted for  cheeses. these folks really know what they are doing with cheese. i do not remember all three that i had, but i am fairly confident that from now on, if it is not the  year old cheddar, they served me, it is not as good as it can get. one dessert item we did not order, but which we saw walk by several times was the  sicilian iris  was a brioche ball with ricotta and chocolate chips, covered with powdered sugar. it looked like it would kill you dead with its awesomeness. some day purple pig...some day. there are many options for vegetarians, and drinkers, and people who just love food in general. the place is also always super crowded...at least the five times we have stopped in over the last several years. but we have never actually had to wait for a table despite this...just lucky, or maybe most people waiting were standing by for outdoor seating. on a side note, years after we first visited the purple pig, we discovered it on a list of america's ten best restaurants. what an incredibly happy accident discovering this place."
1113,Richard D.,1128,5,11/6/18,"you know when you enter a place and the line is packed inside and out that you are going to experience something amazing! well this tapas place was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had. needless to say everything tasted fresh and every plate made was beautiful! i decided to try the grilled octopus, seafood saganaki, jamon dish and the chilled calamari ! every single one of these dishes were flavorful, tasty and just outright amazing! i also want to say the grilled octopus's was out of this world! perfectly made, tender and just outright tasty!"
1114,Paul B.,1128,5,10/25/18,great spot. sometimes a little bit of a wait but worth it for sure. try the calamari baby!
1115,Steve R.,1128,5,10/21/18,"had the pork belly, broccoli, and the calamari . all very delicious. if i get back to chicago i will return."
1116,Justin J.,1128,5,10/21/18,"wait was long but expected for a popular restaurant downtown on friday night. we took a stroll down michigan ave during our wait. staff was friendly and readily available. we ended up sitting with a table of strangers but that should not be a problem unless you are looking for a totally private environment. the food was superb! the calamari antipasto and whipped feta may have been the best thing i have ever eaten. cocktails, specifically the old fashioned was spot on. for chicago, price was pretty reasonable. will definitely be going back again."
1117,Stefanie C.,1128,5,9/24/18,"i do not brag about a lot of things, but i am quite proud of my restaurant selections when it comes to group culinary adventures. we were at a convention and hungry for lunch. it was finally time to leave the twoblock radius and take a lyft to magnificent mile. originally we wanted lou malnati's but the wait was too long. i have had purple pig bookmarked for awhile, so we headed there. because it was a late lunch in the middle of the work week, there was no wait. whew! i totally expected at least a  minute line. the four of us were seated at the high top communal table on the outdoor patio. gorgeous chicago weather, and perfect for hanging out on the patio, especially since it was covered. we shared our food family style, and ordered quite a bit  cornbread  chicharrones  caprese salad  calamari salad  garganelli pasta  chicken thigh kebabs the cornbread and chicharrones were my favorites. i could eat them forever. this restaurant  both food and service  lived up to everything i expected. totally worth the trip out here. while i took a lyft back to the hotel, some of my colleagues walked around mm for some sightseeing... great area to go for a walk and just check out the beautiful, historic sites!"
1118,Tony J.,1128,4,9/21/18,"as you can see i have been here several times before where i enjoyed my prior lunches. my party of  decided to return here again for lunch. because this place is noted as a tourist trap, i really do not mind being trapped here in this particular restaurant. we knew to arrive here early around am when they first open because there is always a line outside to enter this restaurant for lunch. we waited inside the adjacent office building. we were seated almost immediately again in the adjacent tented area. i started and enjoyed my rebel scum cocktail for  and my speckled hen draft beer for . a  ounce glass of tasca leone is an expensive  each. my guests enjoyed  of those glasses. my # favorite shared plates here is the saganaki seafood for , which i enjoyed last time. this time we also enjoyed the shared caesar salad for  and the calamari for . i felt the pizza for , bavette steak for  and meetballs for  were not as unique or as tasty. we all felt the saltimbocca for  was tough and our least favorite shared plate. the four of us agreed. heriberto served our table needs well. my total bill was  less gratuities. we will definitely return here again for some more of our favorite shared lunch plates."
1119,D V.,1128,4,9/8/18,"this was one crazy loud, frenetic, unusual, delicious restaurant! we stopped in early  for some food before seeing hamilton fantastic  lived up to all the hype. it was early but quite busy. there is lots of different seating arrangements high tables, communal tables and regular tables  both inside and out. they seated us at a huge high communal table with bar stools with backs so they were comfortable. not much room for wait staff to squeeze between tables so i was often bumped but it was fine. the menu is quite unusual  descriptions are rather vague and there is no way to tell portion size which made ordering tricky. the waiter was pleasant enough but light on the details when we inquired. he said items were tapas size and so we ordered a bit more but most of the items were def larger than tapas size. but oh well, the food was delicious. we ordered a calamari dish it was kinda like a cold salad with calamari , couscous and chopped up vegetables  very good. we had a pigs feet and pheasant dish  also delicious. we got a cheesemeat board which was wonderful you select whatever numberkind of meat and cheese you would like. also got the milk braised pork shoulder over mashed potatoes  that was everyone's favorite. also had the bbq ribs  delicious. the only dish that was not stellar was the fried chicken drumsticks. was not bad, just not great. any way, the place is loud and crazy busy but lots of fun and delicious. it is kinda expensive but not unreasonable  for  of us probably in line with chicago prices and the quality and dinning experience were top notch. do not go here if you are looking for a quiet night but do go to enjoy unusual, delicious food in a jubilant setting."
1120,Eric W.,1128,5,9/7/18,"made plans to dine here several weeks ago, and finally made it down to chicago from milwaukee and was able to dine in with a friend. it was a thursday, and we ended up making it there from the hotel at about  pm. the restaurant was busy when we got there, and despite this we were seated at the bar immediately. by the time we left, the place was packed as well as the patio. their wine and beer list is impressive, and their cocktails are solid as well. the cooks were working at a furious pace as the kitchen is open and the line was elbow to elbow. i started out with a warpigs from three floyd's and my friend had a dark and stormy. then we ordered. the bartender was helpful with his recommendations, but we kind of decided to go in a different direction but appreciated the thoughtfulness and professionalism. he also knew the menu and what each dish was composed of. we started out with the jlt, with jowel and frise, tomato and a sunny side up duck egg. it was awesome and probably my favorite dish of the night. the yolk was perfect. we then ordered the bone marrow, which came with grilled brioche and a citrus herb salad and a little sea salt. again, very well executed and very flavorful. simple, clean and fresh. we then had the calamari last, and we were pleasantly surprised that it was a cold antipasto. it was fresh and vibrant and the calamari was tender and cooked perfectly. overall, it was a very impressive experience from start to finish. i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for small plates downtown or just good food and drink in general."
1121,Tony D.,1128,5,9/1/18,"we waited about  mins for a table of  at lunch and it was absolutely worth it! ask your waiter for recommendations. we had the calamari , chicken kebabs, and broccoli which were all amazing!!! definitely would come back. makes for a great place to go with a good group of friends because the food is brought out family style to share."
1122,Brena E.,1128,4,8/29/18,"i got here around  on a weeknight with  coworkers and the place was packed! luckily we got a spot at a community table. i am not really a fan of that kind of seating, but it was not bad. the food was amazing! we got the beets, pork shoulder, pizza, calamari not breaded, and a few other items i cannot recall right now. we also enjoyed our cocktails and the wine recommended by our server. one of my friends said she wanted a fruity champagne cocktail and there was nothing on the menu like that, but the bartender made her something that she loved. it does get really loud in there, so keep that in mind. also, my coworker went to the restroom and said it was pretty dirty. other than that, a very good experience."
1123,Stella W.,1128,4,8/12/18,"overall very worth the hype! food is creative and generally good, although the ambiance and service could use a little improvement. we were lucky to be seated right away at  pm on a wednesday. although the place is packed, inside the little room and on the patio. the overall turnout of food and service was not too slow at all. food all of their dishes are going extreme. they are great creative and tasty ones, do not take me wrong. but their spice use and flavor level is very extreme. like the chilled calamari , the calamari itself was so salty that your tongue would go numb for a few seconds if you have  bites in a row. so does the eggplant caponata, the mixture of sourness and sweetness is the only thing you can taste of the bite. you cannot even tell there are eggplants there. roasted bone marrow, same thing. it is like eating warm fat. it is like, the cooks punch you with the pure flavors in the face. i would appreciate if i can taste some of the textures of food more with lighter flavors. service the lady at the front door was very cold and unwelcoming. so does our waitress. you can tell that they are busy and trying to juggle with all the people they have to serve. but come on, at least try to pretend you mean it when you ask how is everything, instead of dropping the question then leave. but the manager, i believe, is very attentive and nice. they have an extensive drinking menu. so if you like spirits and wine, you would for sure appreciate their  something page drinking menu. overall a good place to eat and give it a try, but is it worth  hours of wait? i do not think so."
1124,Quynh N.,1128,5,8/9/18,"this was our first time at the purple pig. we went around lunch time when they just opened so there was no wait. the place quickly filled up soon after. our waiter was attentive and informative. we took on all his recommendations. dishes here are made to share, so he recommended to start with  and it was plenty for  of us. the first dish that came out was calamari . i know what you are thinking, it will be fried! on the contrary, it was not fried but very fresh and light. i could eat it over and over again. second dish was the broccoli, which was tossed in a vinaigrette dressing and top with lentils. so delicious! never had broccoli done this way. our main course was the pork shoulder that was featured on the food network channel. and it did not disappoint!!! the pork fell apart perfectly and it was seasoned so decadently. there was mash potatoes under the pork. it was more runny than the typical mash potatoes but i could not stop eating spoon after spoon."
1125,Alex M.,1128,5,8/5/18,"this place is incredible, ans delivers on all of the hype it gets. shame that restaurant politics got in the way of their stars the past couple years. this is a mustdo when visiting chicago and probably my nd or rd favorite restaurant in the whole city. couple of quick notes they do not take reservations, but you can put your name on the list and they will text you when your table is ready. a friend and i went around  on a friday night last month and waited probably ~ minutes. also be mindful that the place is not very big the climatecontrolled patio helps you will be cozy with those around you and it will be a bit noisy. probably not a good spot for kids or a first date, but if you are looking for a fun spot with friends or your so, purple pig is great. i am not a huge wine drinker but their list of reds is extensive, if you are into that sort of thing. i would recommend getting a cheese board to start. they rotate the cheeses seasonally ask your server for suggestions, and when in doubt, lean toward our neighbors to the north wisconsin. the cheese boards come with jam and pita crackers, which they provide for free, and they jam is delicious. we ordered the broccoli, rissoto gnocchi, calamari , all of which was unbelievable. gnocchi was probably my favorite the flavor and texture caught me offguard. we eschewed the octopus, given my seafood allergy, but i know this is a fan favorite as well. instead we opted for the neopolotian pizza. we concluded with the worldfamous pork shoulder. this along with the pigs ears are the musthave items on the menu. how they get the meat to cut like butter is beyond me. ok tldr it is worth the wait and meets the hype. go for it."
1126,Barb H.,1128,5,7/20/18,"delicious and not really small plates!! we got the octopus, calamari and milk soaked pork. all were incredibly tasty. unique flavors and wonderfully delicious. the octopus was cooked to perfection. so tender. a great place for cocktails and tapas."
1127,Felix G.,1128,5,7/13/18,"my friend and i went for lunch on a saturday there was a  minute or so wait. the waiter recommended we each get around  plates. we ordered the porchetta, calamari , deviled egg, and chicken thigh kabob. they were all super delicious, and the portions ended up being perfect! everything tasted fresh and well cooked. we loved the porchetta and the kabob particularly. my only gripe is that the wait staff were a bit too eager to take plates from us, even when we were not done. they came  times and we said we were not finished all  times. but other than that, the experience was excellent!"
1128,Robert K.,1128,4,7/8/18,we were seated immediately towards the back out on the desk. the waiter was really nice and told us about how the food is served where you share you dishes with each other. it was a hot night and w were able to move to a different table where there was a breeze. the duck was delicious and the calamari was very tender. overall we were very impressed. i would go back again if iived a little closer.
1129,Letty H.,1128,5,7/8/18,"a lot of people come here for the wine and cheese! the wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone here. i came for the food and i thought it was delicious! the food here is meant to be shared and that is what we did! we started with the calamari . for once, we got calamari that was not fried and i was not expecting to like it, but it was one of our favorite dishes! it comes cold and with plenty of flavor. it is a very refreshing dish and i recommend it. the roasted bone marrow was tasty! it comes with an herb salad and sea salt on the side. i like that we can add our own salt to the bone marrow and the herb salad was not bad! it had a lot of cilantro, which i am not too fond of, but the sauce really overpowered the cilantro so i could not taste much of it. next was the milk braised berkshire shoulder. it was soft but way too salty for us. the taste was a little heavy, especially with the mashed potatoes. lastly, we had the turkey leg confit one of our favorites! it was delicious and the portion was huge! it did not have a bone in it and was so tender. the seasoning was delicious. overall, i enjoyed the different flavors here. it was unfamiliar yet delicious. i recommend if you are in the area!"
1130,Joe M.,1128,5,7/6/18,"i had been wanting to go to this place for so long, and it honestly outpaced even my high expectations! we got there about pm on a saturday with a party of , so had no wait, but by the time we left an hour later, the wait looked pretty long. they had an extensive albeit somewhat pricey wine list. we got a bunch of plates to share. the grilled broccoli was awesome and probably cannot even qualify as a vegetable it is so creamy and delicious. the english muffin & truffle sausage was a small but tasty plate, and the calamari salad was light and refreshing. finally, the waiter recommended the pork shoulder for our last dish, and it was quite possibly one of the greatest things my taste buds had the opportunity to savor! it melts in your mouth like you would not believe a meat dish could do."
1131,JM P.,1128,3,6/25/18,"half of this the milk braised pork shoulder, calamari  was the best meal i have had in my life. the other half deepfried wtf oddly sweet pizza, flavorless foie gras cut with white chocolate layered with peas and giving it the essence of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich was just bizarre."
1132,Iyay U.,1128,5,6/20/18,"this is a super late post. my ate and i had a late lunch at the purple pig and had the following beef tendon chicharrones, calamari and that day's special chicken bolognese. the chicharrones was great!! the salt and vinegar taste was just right. the calamari is amazing!! the squid was cooked just right  not rubbery. and the bolognese had just the right amount of spice to give it a kick. if i were you, i will have all three at the purple pig in chicago, il right now!!"
1133,Cindy Z.,1128,4,11/4/18,"this was my first meal after landing in chicago. my friends and i came by on a saturday for brunch. we placed our name, walked around, and was called to our table in a little over an hour. luckily since the purple pig is so centrally located, we were able to walk around and explore the city during that time. the restaurant is crowded with a lot of communal tables. the familyknit atmosphere follows with the familystyle of sharing multiple dishes though. between the four of us, we shared  dishes, which was the perfect amount. my favorites had to be the milk braised pork shoulder  and chicken thigh kebabs . the pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and just fell off the bone. the tenderness of the meat paired so smoothly with the pureed mashed potatoes for this divine consistency. as for the chicken kebabs , they came in huge pieces grilled on a skewer on top of beautifully roasted potatoes . the potatoes were so crispy, yet soft that just made every bite so heavenly. i would definitely get these two dishes again. we also ordered the crispy pig's ears , which is one of their most popular dishes. it comes topped with a sunnyside egg to mixed into the crispy pig ears and veggies. this was a nice dish with a sour twist, but did not stand out as much to me. the grilled broccoli  was a very unique take of the vegetable with a crispy yet creamy texture in a hint of sour taste as well. this was a favorite amongst our table. our last two dishes were the olive oil poached tuna  and stuffed squid . the tuna was so vividly colorful in a beautiful presentation from the purple potatoes , green beans, red peppers, yellow quail eggs, and of course the pink tuna. this was a fun and tasteful dish to try! now although the squid was good, it came with only  pieces. it was also stuffed, so made splitting between  people a bit of a mess. overall, delicious and unique spot on various types of menu items. even though i am not the biggest fan of tapas, i would still recommend coming here and living its hype. i would definitely be back for their meat menu items though, especially that pork shoulder!"
1134,Adam P.,1128,5,10/25/18,"one of my favorite restaurants in the city! have come for both lunch to sit at the bar and dinner and both have exceeded expectations. this is a small place where they cook everything on induction burners fun fact so it may take a bit to get a table but it is wellworth the wait. everything is served as small plates so it is meant for sharing but it has a mediterranean twist my favorite!. if i had to recommend one thing, it would be the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki . and i know what you are thinking i eat chicken all the time, why would i get it when i go out but believe me, it is better than the chicken you eat at home. whenever i come back to the city, i will be back!"
1135,Hayley B.,1128,5,9/23/18,"the purple pig has been a longtime favorite spot of mine and after many years it continues to impress. in fact, my latest visit was my best yet. i went here for lunch with a group of four and we split a bottle of ros, and one order of the saltroasted beets, whipped feta, chicken thigh kebabs , and octopus. it was the perfect amount for four people, and we were all silent when the food it the table because we were so busy eating. though we thoroughly enjoyed each dish, the table favorite was the chicken thigh kebabs  the combo of the crispy smashed potatoes , and deliciously creamy tzatziki sauce was to die for. this is a great spot to share small plates with friends, just arrive early and plan to wait for a table  they do the whole we will text you when we are ready deal so you can shop while you wait for your turn."
1136,Kevin M.,1128,5,8/5/18,"being our first visit to chicago, we asked multiple uber drivers and locals where their favorite spots were downtown. the purple pig came up multiple times in those conversations. my wife and i ended up going twice for dinner in the  nights we were in town. it is incredible! we went both times at odd dining hours as we were told it is normally packed with long wait times. we did not have to wait to be seated either time we went. highly recommend the chicken thigh kebabs and broccoli. service was great and fast both times! the purple pig is a must do while in downtown chicago."
1137,Christine L.,1128,5,6/30/18,"so really this is a . but i have to give them  stars as it is jeremy c's fave place in the city. food here has been consistently excellent, we often recommend this place for out of town guests, partly because of the excellent location. it is on michigan ave, not far from the chicago river, and you can walk to millenium park if you are up for it. there is no parking, i would recommend spothero if you are driving, there is a few underground garages nearby. otherwise uberlyfttaxi or use public transport. onto the food! the menu is constantly changing but one dish we always order is the chicken thigh kebabs with smashed fried potatoes and tzatziki . so much yumminess! their veggies are also surprisingly good, and the grilled octopus we had the last time we went was also very tasty. food is served tapas style, so it is technically smaller, shared plates, but priced a little higher than typical tapas.but it is so good it is worth it! it can get very busy, with a wait. and they have both outdoor and indoor seating available. you may find yourself squeezing into a table with other people. it is definitely an experience! anyways, come here, enjoy the food, and then take a walk and enjoy the sights of downtown chicago."
1138,Penelope A.,1128,5,6/29/18,"when we came in we were told there was a  min wait for a table but was lucky to get  seats at the bar. we enjoyed hanging out at the bar. we shared the grilled broccoli as an appetizer, then as our entree's chicken thigh kebabs and the huevos rotos con chorizo, both paired with a riesling."
1139,Ee Vonn Y.,1128,3,6/12/18,"interior  cute, cramped, warm. patio seating is warmed up also. service  slow, took several requests for water and refills to get anyone's attention, all seemed annoyed and ignored us every now and then. wait time  last party to get seated on friday atpm before the restaurant was entirely filled up. grilled octopus fingerling potatoes , green beans, salsa verde  best item. octopus was very soft, fluffy, and light. the dish was oily and salty. crispy pig's ears kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg  also greasy. the kale chips were salty and delicious. best kale chips i have had. pig ears are crispy and salty. saltroasted beats whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter  generous portion, delicious thick pistachio butter. combination worked well. again, rich and salty. chicken thigh kebabs  fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki   cannot get any saltier than this. the chicken was average. the potatoes and tzatziki sauce is interesting but did not work so great for me."
1140,Ryan I.,1128,4,5/25/18,"was in town for work and tracked down this place to try it out as others have told me how great it is. i ordered the chorizo stuffed olives too much vinegar and chorizo flavors did not have much presence and chicken thigh kebabs perfect, would order again. this place is smaller then most restaurants which creates a very tightnit feel almost like you are at a family reunion and everyone is crammed into a small space but do not ever really notice it because everyone is having such a great time. i sat a communal table with some other offend folks and enjoyed my conversations with them."
1141,Tuanh D.,1128,4,5/6/18,"i was so excited to try the purple pig and i had such a good time here. i sat at the bar and the servers were on top of everything. i had a meat and cheese board to start with duck prosciutto, chorizo and prosciutto and a brie cheese. the duck and chorizo were delicious but i would skip the regular prosciutto next time and try a different meat. the brie was delicious and perfect for spreading and i really enjoy the fruit spread that came with it. for the main course, i had the chicken thigh kebabs with tzatziki sauce and fried potatoes . it was amazingly good  definitely a big portion but it was so yummy that i finished it all. would highly recommend coming here if you get the chance!"
1142,Mark N.,1128,5,4/27/18,absolutely outstanding food here. the saltroasted beets is a perfect starter. with whipped goat cheese and an amazing pistachio butter you will get an array of awesome flavors and textures. the chicken kebabs are unique. they use thigh meat instead of breast meat. the fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki that come with it perfectly rounds out the dish. we finished with the housemade meatballs with green garlic and toasted brioch. lots and lots of flavor here. the meatballs were perfectly cooked. nice beer and wine list. service was great.
1143,Sarah S.,1128,5,4/11/18,"first time at purple pig and it was really good! my friends and i have never had tapas before.there was a  minute wait and they called us earlier because someone canceled their reservation but we were already across the street at dylans candy store ordering drinks. they eventually sat us at this big table that had about  chairs or so. it was weird because we basically had to share this huge table with other strangers on the positive we did get to sit together. it was nice to see what others had at the table and ask them what they ordered without it being too weird asking across the room. our waiter, troy, was very friendly and informative helped make our visit great, we tried like  different dishes, the hummus , blade steak , roasted bone marro , chicken thigh kebabs , and the grilled broccoli . my favorite out of all of them had to be the hummus and the grilled broccoli. the blade steak was pretty good too. all of it was excellent, honestly. in the hummus they have a soft boiled egg that you crack and mix it in with the chick peas the pita bread was excellent too! the tzatziki sauce with the chicken thigh kebabs were a good touch, it was also served with fried smashed potatoes which i did not know was at first. the grilled broccoli was good but it tasted a little too salty for me but at the same time it was addicting. our check was split evenly since we split our food with each other. if i come back to chicago i will be coming back and having different tapas since the ones we had were so good."
1144,Vidhi S.,1128,4,9/25/17,"the purple pig is a really cool restaurant right off michigan ave. cool, trendy ambiance. i came here with a friend on a wednesday night  the place was packed and there was a  minute wait for their tables but we were able to get bar seating right away. we ordered the duck confit pate, milk braised pork shoulder, and the chicken thigh kebabs with tzatziki sauce. the duck confit is absolutely delicious and unique  def worth trying. the chicken kebabs were good, but not anything to rave about. i was not a fan of the pork shoulder  the meat was really tender but i thought overall the dish was pretty bland. although the purple pig is a bit pricey the portions are quite large. the service was ok  our waiter was nice but not very attentive. we had to call him over everytime we wanted to order, get our check, etc. overall i enjoyed dining at the purple pig but would likely order different items next time. many of the dishes that people ordered around us looked delicious!"
1145,Melissa F.,1128,5,8/25/17,"one of the best meals of my life  beet and goat cheese, octopus, pork shoulder, and chicken thigh kebabs were all superb. a word of caution on portion size...plates are much larger than we were prepared for so we definitely overordered for two as the waiter recommended at least two dishes each. a surprise highlight were the fried mashed potato wedges on the side of the chicken , though the chicken would have been our dish to cut to make it more of an appropriate amount of food for . delicious overall!"
1146,Amy C.,1128,5,6/25/17,"you will wait forever to get in, it is loud and terribly crowded, but none of that will matter once you start eating. more than five thousand other yelpers have written a review, but it cannot be overstated. this place lives up to the hype. four of us were on a girls weekend in chicago, eating and shopping our way through the city. we made two failed attempts to get in but were foiled by the long wait over an hour on a weeknight! the third time was a charm we came early enough and only waited about a half hour. four was a perfect number for sampling several items on the menu. we started with the pork roasted almonds. no almond will ever live up to the flavor of nuts roasted in pork fat. good lord. next was saltroasted beets with whipped goat cheese. my cousin, a selfprofessed beet whore nearly fainted. we all wanted to lick our plates after sharing those garnet delicacies. the roasted cauliflower was on point. the fried pig's ear was julienned and topped with a fried egg. the chamomille tea smoked pork leg was like tasting pork the way it should always be cooked. i would not bother with the chicken thigh kebabs again, they were fine, but i would keep to the porcine theme rather than fill up on fowl. the meaballs were very good, but i would be more adventurous. after every new plate was served, we would all close our eyes, lean back and blissfully moan over the flavors. you will develop a community with your table mates as you watch what everyone else is trying and adding to your order when you see something you like or hear another patron gushing over their small plates. somehow, i managed a few bites of the meyer lemon bar. perfect ending to a meomorable meal."
1147,Lisa R.,1128,5,5/10/17,"purple pig was highly recommended by a friend of the boyfriend and i. on our way to our hotel we saw it and walked in. you really have to look for it, if not you might miss it since it is located on the side of the building. once entering the side of the building they have an outside patio that it is covered with a purple tent and heated lamps for the cold weather. it was around pm and it was a full house, wait time for  was around  minutes. they take your cell phone number to confirm your wait time and then you receive another text letting you know that your table is ready and you have  minutes to claim it by replying y for yes. since we saw  seats empty by the bar we cancelled our table and sat there instead and i was glad this happened since we got to chat with the bartender and watch him make our specialty cocktails. i got the chicken thigh kebabs with fried mashed potatoes with tzatziki sauce on the bottom, the boyfriend got the pork shoulder which i tasted and it was moist, soft and went well with the mash potatoes it is not a big plate so if you are really hungry opt for an appetizer. both dishes were really good and reasonably priced. for dessert we got the affogato, usually the affogato comes with vanilla bean gelato but we chose the salted caramel instead and with the shot of espresso, the boyfriend and i thought why did we share this but we were stuffed so it was a good thing we did share. purple pig was so good that everything after this was hard to compare and beat. we need a purple pig in nyc, another staple worth coming back too."
1148,Yuan C.,1128,5,5/2/17,"if there is one musttry restaurant in chicago for visitors, the purple pig is it!! it is located in the center of downtown chicago, where you can stop for a bite between exploring millennium park, chicago river, and michigan ave! their menu is also seasonable, offering a huge selection of delicious items! definitely recommend coming here with a larger group since it is familystyle tapas the more people=the more food you get to try!! here are a few things i have tried  roasted bone marrow this is my goto dish! love the scrumptiousness of the buttery bone marrow. pairs so so well with the garlic bread and parsley!  mozzerella w apricot applesauce very interesting take on your typical mozz sticks! note quite worth the price but glad i gave it a try  fried brussel sprouts cannot go wrong with brussel sprouts esp when they are fried !  charred cauliflower great savory flavor!  house cured sardines the sardines are not as salty as i would expected, which is a good thing! really nice way of spicing up boring ol' sardines.  octopus w green beans really delicious and highly recommend!  chicken thigh kebabs  pretty flavorful and a great item for those who are not as adventurous when it comes to food!  sicillian iris dessert with ricotta cheese and chocolate. pretty much likely a beignet with chocolate and slight hint of ricotta cheese inside. not too impressed and probably will not order again. will def be coming back over and over again "
1149,Hiram P.,1128,5,4/12/17,the pigs ear with crunchy kale and egg on top was on point. and the chicken kebabs with fried smashed potatoes was full of flavor. very remarkable experience
1150,Maisee T.,1128,5,5/27/18,"great food and great service! we went prior to the opening of lunch, and there was already a line! thankfully once it opened, we were seated right away. the two of us ordered  chorizo  stuffed olives the greek yogurt sauce was a great contrast to offset the saltiness of the olives   roasted bone marrow like buttah!  grilled octopus soft and well seasoned  crispy pig's ear  seafood saganaki our favorite. i wished we were given a load of bread to soak up the sauce. everyone in your party must be present to be seated!"
1151,K H.,1128,5,5/22/18,"first trip to chicago and stopped by the purple pig on our first day and again on our last. we did not make a reservation and it was bustling, but managed to squeeze in without one both times. we loved everything we tried on the menu, and the food was very well priced for what they produced. menu was unique and the flavors were great! we tried chorizo stuffed olives , corn bread, deep fried pizza, turkey leg, broccoli, rib eye, octopus, and the honey cinnamon donuts  i would highly recommend any and all of these dishes. great spot and great atmosphere and would definitely return if we came to chicago again!"
1152,Eric T.,1128,5,4/13/18,"wow... just wow. so jewboy and i were drained after the conference. we were initially planning on going to eat at eataly but after seeing plenty of mediocre yelp reviews for the restaurants in there, we elected on something else. we had passed the purple pig the other night, our conference had recommended it, and a chicago friend also recommended it so we gave it a shot. apparently, it was a busier night than normal. we were told a  hour wait, but we had a seat in  minutes. i personally do not mind communal seating, but if it is not your thing, your wait could be longer. we got a cheese forget which one but it was bomb and the jam it came with was a good mix of sweet and savory. the chorizo stuffed olives were pretty good... not my favorite but jewboy loved them. we got this whipped feta with date crackers. the crackers added a light touch of sweetness and the cheese was so light and airy it makes whipped cream cheese look like a joke. the red snapper was well cooked with a crispy crust and not dry at all. the gnocchi... wow just wow. so light, not starchy. the sauce and meat just complimented it so well. we finished with a milk braised shoulder and osso bucco... both so tender they just fell apart. the dessert menu looked amazing but obviously we were way too full. definitely in the top  meals of my life. props to the chef and will definitely be back."
1153,Becca T.,1128,5,3/21/18,"so i heard great things about this place and i was so happy i tried it. they do not take reservations but when i came on a friday afternoon it was only a  minute wait which was perfect. there were only  of us but so many things on the menu looked good so we had to be selective. we shared the chorizo stuffed olives , the pork saltimbocca, gyro, and english muffin with truffle sausage. everything was so flavorful and different. this is a perfect place to go with a group of people in order to try all their delicious dishes. i would return here for dinner for sure."
1154,Amy D.,1128,4,1/31/18,"cute tapas style restaurant with a lot of inventive dishes in downtown chicago. they do not take reservations, so come early to avoid waiting in line! they were pretty busy at noon on a friday, and since we came a few minutes before, we were able to grab one of the last tables for a party of . it was partially communal seating, since we sat at one end of a larger table, but there were some empty seats between the two parties. they have an extensive menu, and portion sizes vary between the dishes. we tried salt roasted beets whipped goat cheese, pistachio butter, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  yum i love beets, and they roasted the beets perfectly. it went well with the whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter, and this was a huge serving recommended!  stuffed squid prosciutto, breadcrumbs, santorini fava pure, charmoula, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  the squid is nice and tender, and this dish was very flavorful. i do not eat very salty, so this dish was borderline salty for me. crispy pig's ear kale, pickled cherry peppers, fried egg, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  the crispy pig's ears were sliced a little too thinly for me, but it had a good crisp. i wish they added more flavors to the pig's ears instead of a fried egg, since that did not do anything for this dish. however, the kale was delicious, and super crispy. this dish is worth trying once. fried pizza neapolitan bufala mozzarella, radicchio, fig, balsamic, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  this dish looked and sounded amazing, but the fried pizza dough was very plain. the ingredients did not quite come together for me, and i probably would not order this again. housemade meatballs green garlic, ricotta, toasted brioche, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  solid meatballs, and they were softfluffy on the inside with a nice sear on the outside. lots of flavors going on here recommended!  chorizo stuffed olives , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  these were way too salty for me it was salt on salt. skip! fried polenta & mozzarella prosciutto, pistachio, mint pesto, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  yum i liked this bite since all the ingredients worked well together. recommended! milk braised berkshire pork shoulder mashed potatoes, puffed farro, , yelp.comuser_local_photÄ  this pork shoulder was so tender the meat flaked off with your fork, and almost melted in your mouth. i wish they served the pork with something other than mashed potatoes so that the dish has more texture. i would have preferred this served on top of pasta instead. service was awesome, and our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. the food comes out really quickly, and we received all our dishes within  minutes of ordering. i would highly recommend coming here with a small group so that you can sample a lot of different dishes."
1155,Rachel A.,1128,5,12/16/17,"can i move this place to vegas?! unquestionably the best mediterranean food i have had! this was the first place my boyfriend and i visited upon arriving in chicago and it completely exceeded all expectations. the menu offers quite the variety and plates are suggested to be shareable tapa style. we started with the chorizo stuffed olives which were served on top of some plain yogurt so flavorful and the yogurt greatly complimented the olives . next, we had the olive oil poached tuna and oh my goodness if i could eat this dish everyday i would also, for a salad it was very flavorful and hearty. next came the bone marrow served with bread and mixed greens it was my boyfriend's first time having bone marrow and he compared it to a thicker butter which obviously is a sign of a good bone marrow. and last, the lamb gyro. the lamb was cooked to perfection, layered on top of tzatziki sauce, and topped with some greens and roasted tomatoes just p e are f e c t. and to top it all off they offer a copious selection of wine and service was exceptional! highly recommend this place!"
1156,Kelsey D.,1128,4,12/11/17,"the chorizo stuffed olives and chicken kabobs were delicious!! we got there before pm and walked right in, but apparently the wait is usually super long."
1157,Allison S.,1128,5,8/5/17,service was great and we got seated right away! beets with ricotta was delicious! chorizo stuffed olives were salty but balanced out with the cheese sauce. pork shoulder was so tender and flavorful! grilled octopus was tender and yummy! the only thing was i ordered a ginger soda which was disgusting but the server took it off!
1158,Pam W.,1128,5,7/1/17,"wow! this place is good. it is also super busy, even on a wednesday night. i am often in chicago and love this city for so many reasons, especially its terrific food scene. we were staying at the intercontinental right across the street, which i highly recommend. i have heard a lot about purple pig but have not made it to the restaurant before now. a few things you should know they do not take reservations, so it is first come, first served. be prepared to wait. waiting for a table is not bad because you can grab a drink and enjoy it in their patio area. they have an extensive wine list, so if you are a wine drinker, you will have lots of options. but note that their wines are pricey by the glass, so if a few of you are having wine, just share a bottle. okay, back to the review. we arrived around  and put our name on the list. they take your phone number so they can text you when the table is ready. they give you a minute window to get to the restaurant, so you could check in and then visit some local stores. we were just starting a second glass of wine and beer when they texted. we headed to the host stand and while we waiting in line to get our table, a woman went to the front of the line and was very rude to everyone. she was clearly angry and was saying she was in line before everyone and we all cut the line. the host handled it perfectly, telling her that she would help the folks in line then would assist her. i hope she was embarrassed because she made an a of herself. we were at a twotop table and were quickly greeted by our server, who explained the menu and made some recommendations. their menu has so many great options! we opted for a variety of dishes to share, including chorizo  stuffed olives , deepfried egg, fava bean pure, crispy pigs ears, secreto smoked pork dish, and lamb and pork kefedes. everything was great! little touches elevated each dish...pickled okra with the fried deviled egg, microgreens with the chorizo  stuffed olives , cayenne in the kale with the pigs ears...i am making myself hungry! if you have not tried the purple pig, go now! you will have an awesome, memorable and craveworthy meal."
1159,Kristen N.,1128,5,6/29/17,"we loved our experience at the purple pig! small plates are such a fun way to go and especially when they are not run of the mill. we went on june th, a beautiful saturday in chicago. there were  of us. our friends had been there before, so they knew the ropes get there early we were there at am for the am opening and there was already a line be prepared for very crowded and noisy conditions and seating that is more european so you can make new friends and see what everyone else is eating so you can decide what to try next be adventuresome and willing to try new food. our waiter was excellent and very helpful with choosing dishes  the variety is inventive, fresh and tasty and the perfect size for sharing. i also like that they do not bring everything out at once. the pace was very good. we tried the chorizo stuffed olives , smashed potatoes yum, roasted broccoli yum, calamari not my fave  too much vinegar, hummus ok, deviled eggs yum, and the jlt pork jowl, arugula and tomato  ok. our friend tried the berry infused sangria and loved it. i loved that they had sparkling rose wine and mimosas. we really wanted to try a few more things and have dessert, but were too full. will have to go back and do that. even though it was packed, we never felt rushed or pushed. we were pleasantly surprised by the bill as well  not nearly as high as we thought it would be for the quality that we got. would definitely recommend coming here!"
1160,Jessie Elizabeth J.,1128,5,4/27/17,"what a tasty gem hidden in the middle of the touristy black hole that is michigan avenue! a for service, ambience, and food! long time chicagoan but first time at the purple pig. got there at pm after work and were promptly seated on the patio. saltroasted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio butter were phenomenal. portion is perfect for sharing and the whipped goat cheese was plentiful. just enough pistachio butter to add some weight to the airy cheese and tangy beets. chorizo stuffed olives  olives atop some sour of sour cream. nothing crazy here but if you enjoy olives worth the tasting. chorizo is a teaspoons worth and breading very light. pork blade steak with 'nduja & honey  my favorite dish of the meal! tender, perfectly cooked pork steak seasoned well and accompanied by an arugula salad and smear of ndula sausage. very filling and perfect for  to share. we originally ordered another main but were informed after waiting a bit that the chef was unhappy with the result. we were comped any other dish on the house! we went with the chamomile tea smoked pork leg steak for two with charred cabbage, sherry membrillo & pork marrow custard fabulous presentation of two great cuts of pork leg. the chamomile lent itself to the meat in a really interesting way in that it made the flavor of the pork stand out more. the charred cabbage was delicious i could have eaten it in a salad. the sherry membrillo is a guava reduction and was tangysweet, a great compliment to the pork. the bone marrow custard came served in a bone cavity. this was good for spreading onto the meat and gave the leanness some weight. caramel poached pears. almond genoa bread, pear ice cream & chocolate veil absolutely stunning presentation and flavors. the bread is an almond confection so moist and buttery. this is dolloped with a fair share of tangy, truetolife tasting pear ice cream and fanned with  succulent brandypoached pear slices under a blanket of smooth chocolate. we will definitely be back for a cheesemeat platter and some wine!"
1161,Tania N.,1128,5,1/11/17,"while visiting my sister i had some time to myself and my brother in law recommended this place. i went there for lunch and did not require a reservation but it was packed. the sat me at a communal table since the only two seats left in the bar were impossible to get to. the staff was extremely nice. they recommended to options of wine and allowed me to taste them. afterwards came the food. have in mind that this place is designed to go with a group get different plates and try them all. nevertheless i am a eater so i ate everything myself. i got the chorizo stuffed olives to start and then a shoulder pork chop with honey glaze. everything was delicious! perfectly cooked, great taste and texture. to finish my meal i had a great chocolate cake with homemade ice cream. for all this i paid  including tip which i think is fair for the quality of the restaurant."
1162,Lee F.,1128,5,12/7/16,great tapas. many unique selections. i have the chorizo stuffed olives and the pig ear. both were tasty.
1163,Lisa H.,1128,5,10/24/16,"what can be said about purple pig that has not been said already? the food here really is amazing. my girlfriends and i came for a snack in between meals when visiting chicago but after finishing our mouthwatering tapas we definitely wanted more. we could not stop talking about how great the food was for the rest of our trip. roasted bone marrow flavorful and delicious. pork shoulder perfectly cooked that it just melts in your mouth especially combined with the mashed potatoes. mmmm, this was our favorite!! salt and vinegar beef tendons chips crunchy and had the right amount of vinegar that it does not become overwhelming.  chorizo stuffed olives  tasty but we were not crazy about this dish. thought it was a little pricey for  olives . purple pig is a must try when visiting chitown. keep in mind these are all small plates that are meant for sharing. also, there is almost always a wait. come in and put your name on the list, they will call you when your table is ready. there is a lot of shopping near by to help you pass time."
1164,amanda b.,1128,4,10/10/16,"this place was packed so we were lucky to get a table. to me the food was hit or miss. some standout dishes were the octopus and the taramasalata. they were both amazing. the milk braised pork was good. the chorizo stuffed olives and the foie gras and lobster sausage were both not so good. the sausage was actually pretty bad the texture was too soft and it had a strong seafood taste like the taste fresh seafood should not have. all in all i would go back, but sticking to my favorites as i am a little hesitant to further experiment."
1165,Justin S.,1128,5,9/13/16,"the food here was some of the best i have had. i got the chorizo stuffed olives and jlt sandwich and i wanted to order another to go. the bartender knew the menu well, recommended great food, and was on top of service. i also got the off color beer, which is a local brew, and incredible. try this place out, you will not regret it!"
1166,Jem S.,1128,5,8/19/16,"the purple pig is amazing  outstanding food and excellent service. for a party of three we waited about  minutes to get seated. while we were waiting, a server served us drinks which helped the time pass more quickly. for appetisers, we ordered the chorizo  stuffed olives and the smoked trout. the chorizo  stuffed olives were salty, but came with a white sauce that tamed the saltiness. the smoked trout was delicious. it came in a jar that contained smoke and released in front of us. it was accompanied by crisps, which is eaten with the trout on top. the main dishes that we had were the bone marrow, half duck, and lamb ribs. the bone marrow was very rich and came topped with parsley and capers. the capers added a saltiness to the bone marrow. i wish that the bone had some more marrow because after a couple scoops, there was barely any left to go around. the half duck was prepared perfectly. the skin was crispy and rich in flavour and the meat was juicy. it came with caviar, sauce, and rolls, which could be used to make a mini duck slider. the option to make one's own sandwich was a cute touch. or all the components could be eaten separately. the half duck is hearty and larger compared to the other plates. the lamb ribs were my favourite. it had this amazing glaze that tempered the gamey flavour that is often attributed to lamb. the meat fell right off the bone and i could have eaten two orders of that dish by myself. i definitely recommend the lamb ribs. the purple pig is an excellent dining experience and great for large groups or just two people. i highly recommend it. in addition, it is in a pretty nice area of downtown chicago."
1167,Dily N.,1128,5,8/4/16,"amazing place, the service was outstanding too! we had the chorizo stuffed olives for an appetizer and i had the pork shoulder ... delicious! the dessert was to die for, sicilian iris! yum! will definitely be back next time we visit chicago!"
1168,Rads K.,1128,5,7/28/16,"everytime i go here i order something different and it is amazing every time. the cheeses are really great and come with jams and crackers which complement them perfectly. the lamb was really tender and flavorful, would highly recommend it. the chorizo stuffed olives are a musthave as well. overall, great dining experience and definitely going back."
1169,Parth B.,1128,1,10/25/18,"food was not on par, service was horrible, and my friends and i will never be back. observed waiter not wash his hands after using the restroom. truly disappointed  grossest experience i have had in a long time."
1170,Nancy Y.,1128,1,10/25/18,"service was mediocre, server forgot about our table. waited inline for an hr to try the bone marrow but they were sold out before pm and the rest of the food on the menu did nothing for me. would not go back."
1171,Vicky S.,1128,1,10/9/18,"are you serious this is a newly cooked meal not someone's leftover? this is carrot which really not worth  at all... other dishes are fine. i know it is more money than regular restaurant, but as a business, you has to at least satisfy you customers."
1172,Mark V.,1128,1,9/22/18,"overrated and not even close to being worth the wait... considering chicago is an awesome foodie town, go somewhere else. service with an attitude...a bad attitude."
1173,Ivan C.,1128,1,9/20/18,"we order the pork belly, chicken kebab. the food is very average and super overpriced. i do not know what is the hype."
1174,Jennifer G.,1128,1,9/15/18,"i will start by saying the review is not based on the food. it is based on the experience i had last night at the restaurant. they do not take reservations or wait lists. i understand that about a place  not that i love it bc it is then hard to get in. last night  a little before  pm, we were five blocks from the pig and called to ask how long a wait would be for two people. if it was too long, we were going to veer directions and walk to another dinner place. the person who answered the phone told us, there was no wait and they could seat us now  subject to us arriving. she repeated that twice to us. so  we walked the five blocks there. we were there in less than  minutes from our phone call. we get there...and we are told it is  minute wait for two people. i look at her and i am pretty sure she is the one we spoke to on the phone and ask her how in  minutes, it went from no wait to almost  min? i was guessing a  min wait tops. she said we had a line out the door. why did not she tell us that on the phone??? what did she hope to gain by lying to us on the phone? we will not be back. we have had the food before and it is not worth that frustration. so many other restaurants in the city with just as good as food and a much better customer service."
1175,Laura T.,1128,1,8/26/18,"horrible sevice. they have a lot of employees and still the service is terrible. we had to ask for the menu, then waited for someone to take out order and nothing, two waiters said i am coming and nothing.... we had to leave"
1176,Nicole B.,1128,1,8/9/18,"rating solely for the lack of service. front of house is a travesty, came here on my last night visiting chicago and purple pig soured an otherwise great trip. as new yorkers and no strangers to trendy places, we were prepared to wait but were not prepared to be ignored, forgotten, then haphazardly crammed into a shared table. long story short, no restaurant is worth feeling like a nuisance. i could not stomach patronizing a place that clearly cannot handle a full house and still treat people with respect. long story we came around pm tonight a thursday and the place was packed, both the inside, the bar, and the outside covered seating. we were quoted min   hr wait time for  people. there is not enough seating on the long walkway leading to the restaurant to wait, so we walked to a shopping center nearby. you get a text and  minutes to claim your spot once a table opens up. we rushed over only to be told to wait some more and stand by the window nearby. well...there is about a foot of space between the window and other seated guests. in that tiny space, staff and servers are running by. this meant we were constantly having to shift to accommodate staff coming through which made us feel very unwanted and uncomfortable. the entrance door is the only door to get to the patio and is right by the host stand too so it is just collision central in that area. there is really nowhere to wait or even stand to speak to the host and not be in the way. after  more minutes of waiting and being completely ignored we had waited over an hour total by now, i fought my way to the host stand and discovered we had been forgotten. we quickly got dumped in a shared table with an option to either sit side by side and stare all night at a couple across from us or sit across from each other squeezed in between the couple and a group of guy coworkers. we chose the latter, but the chairs in the communal table were crammed so tightly and the other guests were seated in such a way that we ended up being diagonal from each other rather than directly across. by then, we could not justify staying. so we voted with our feet and got our farewell chicago dinner elsewhere."
1177,Nick B.,1128,1,7/24/18,"this is the perfect spot to go if you are already full, have a company card and do not enjoy a tasteful dinner. i came here with three colleagues and we ordered what seemed to be plenty of food but we left hungry. the portions are small, the food was underwhelming, and the service was average. if you want to have a few bites for fun for a snack and spend upwards of , then you should absolutely stop by. if you want to get your money's worth and have a fine dining experience, stay away."
1178,Barbara M.,1128,1,7/20/18,"happened in on a raining tuesday for lunch. we scored two seats on the corner at the bar and thought we were the luckiest folks on the planet. the servers totally ignored us. they oozed over the group of  sitting next to us and then passed us over for the woman seated next to us. we asked for water while we perused the menus. after  minutes, no water and the servers were busy schmoozing both parties on both sides of us. when we tried to catch their eyes to order we were rebuffed. we got up to leave, and noticed the servers rolled their eyes to each other."
1179,Heide J.,1128,1,7/19/18,"good food but i am sitting in the outside dining area and they are refusing to turn the fans on. one employee said they were not working, another said they would speak to management, and the third said they would make sure they get turned on but that was  minutes ago..."
1180,Jing-Jing Z.,1128,1,7/9/18,"i hated the restaurant. it was loud and crowded, and there was rock music in addition to the noise. it must have been over  decibels in there. there was really poor lighting, so you could barely see the menu properly. the space was really small and you could touch the waiters walking by without even fully extending your arm. the waiters were kinda gruff, and we did not feel welcome. the place was more like a bar than a restaurant. never go here if you want to go to a quiet place for dinner."
1181,Lucy R.,1128,1,7/9/18,"the only thing missing at the purple pig is the trough. one star is for poor dining room  kitchen counter layout, free for all find a place to sit panic overwhelmed servers and an overall uncomfortable disaster. the food looked amazing as i stared into the open kitchen, forever defending off body assaults from the staff bumping into me repeatedly without acknowledging that maybe i was ready to order....forever. not once could i get anyone's attention. i get how they need to pack everything and everyone into this place, but a restaurant famous for pork does not attract the fittest people...and therefore, everyone is on the larger side, spilling into everyone else's personal space and server travel lanes. i seriously have bruises from trying to sit at the kitchen counter waiting for nothing it turned out. i eventually left and crossed the street to bandera, the most wonderful, sophisticated and spacious bar one could ever ask for. lightning fast service and a delicious pork chop. imagine that."
1182,Mimi L.,1128,1,7/6/18,"i was so disappointed with the food and service. we waited  hour for our seating, which was ok but the server that was supposed to take our drink order as we waited outside showed up as we were about to get seated. we ordered the broccoli, pigs ears, beets, blade steak, cheese and sausage and only one thing tasted good. the beets were good, but nothing to come back for. the pig ears tasted like fried batter, no flavor and just crunchy oily batter. the broccoli had a strange after taste. the blade pork steak did not stand out. would not recommend this place as there are so many other places in chicago to try."
1183,Christina S.,1128,1,6/18/18,"what a bummer! i am in town for the night, limited time to explore and eat. tons of friends who live here have told me about the purple pig multiple times. rave reviews from them, i was excited to have the chance to dine! i walk in and after a really long beat, definitely standing, waiting, looking around, wanting to be greeted. first time here, i do not know if i should just seat myself. finally, i catch the eye of the girl standing right in front of me. with a rude smirk on her face. like i had to approach her. total attitude. i ask her if she is the hostess, and she says yes. i told her i was waiting to be greeted, then excused myself and walked out. her vibe was such a turn off, that i lost out on a chance to eat there. managers, be aware. the first impression lasts the longest!"
1184,Brittany G.,1128,1,5/28/18,"my most recent visit to this place was no good to say the least. i loved it the first time, the calamari is to die for, loved it so much i decided to go back a second time and was extremely disappointed with the service i was given. the bartender served many people before me even though i was sitting there before them...unsure if they were regulars but it was like pulling teeth to even get a menu from him. because drinks took so long i decided to go elsewhere for food because i only imagined how long it would take for food, or for him to even take my food order. drank my beer, left cash and the bar and walked out."
1185,Chris L.,1128,1,5/21/18,"was in chicago for work and in my research came up with this place which i was looking forward to trying. went on a tuesday night at  and place was packed with a long line waiting so decided to do take out which i was informed they do not do take out. in all my years of being a foodie and traveling all over, this is the first time i have ever heard of this so my review is based solely on that. what is it to cook food and put in a box and let people go on their way instead of waiting an hour on line and then waiting in the restaurant at a table? lost all interest."
1186,Jackie N.,1128,1,5/10/18,"pros good bone marrow cons salty octopus dish and bread, we did not have a waiter, yes...you heard that right, we did not have a waiter tending to us, so our night was spent flagging whoever was serving the people near us. it was very frustrating."
1187,John A.,1128,1,4/26/18,"the food is good but the service is horrible. each dish is served as it is cooked. this is not a good way to eat. food is meant to be enjoyed together. the restaurant is so loud, the only way to communicate is to tell. these shortcomings come with a large bill."
1188,Joanna S.,1128,1,3/18/18,"terrible hostess. sat us a communal table, which was fine. but, was in front of patio door that every time it opened put a big blast of wind on me at the table, strong enough to blow menu's off table. when i tried to move over a chair, i was informed i cld not change my seat and must sit in the chair i was given. i informed hostess of the blast of wind issue, but she had no sympathy and pretty much told me to take it or leave it. i left it."
1189,Selina Y.,1128,1,2/24/18,terrible experience do not waste your money and time. i left my number with them and double checked but i guess they got my number wrong because i came back the time they told me and they said they texted me a while back. i explained i did not get any text and they called another hostess over to tell me the same thing we actually texted you a while back and made it sound like i ignored the text or something but i explained again i did not get any text. i saw that they wrote down the wrong number and said it is actually  instead of  it seems like they did not even try to listen because they said okay and called over another person to tell me they can put me back on the list for another  min wait. the whole process had not a word of apology or acknowledging that they took the number down wrong.
1190,Tiffany M.,1128,1,2/11/18,such a disappointment. two and a half hour wait. hour wait for food. sliced thumb on bathroom door. told staff who snickered and said gross from bleeding. woman manager came up asked if i wanted to write a report. i said embarrassed no please just let people know your bathroom lock is sharp and dangerous. they laughed and after my table paid full price for birthday dinner and horrible wait and service. the other manager said if i need hospital assistance or had to get a tetanus shot for cut to call him and handed me his card. just ridiculous. awful management. horrible experience.
1191,Pixie L.,1128,1,1/20/18,"disclaimer im not an easy pleaser with food. this place is a no. they recommended three dishes for me  broccoli, the pork shoulder, and the bone marrow. the bone marrow was amazing. definitely get this and possibly only this if you go. after that, everything went down hill. i returned the broccoli and shoulder after a bite. they look amazing but they taste so salty, could not taste anything but salt. bottom line if you like salty food, go. if not, stay away! or get the marrow"
1192,Amber L.,1128,1,1/18/18,"urghhhhh i have gone to many of fivestar restaurants throughout the major cities but this restaurant is absolutely overrated. everything on the menu was salty and overly seasoned. you cannot taste the original ingredients. if they had good service, i would have given them  stars at least. however, unfortunately our server was very rude to us. when we politely asked our server to remove one of the dish we barely ate because it is too salty, he looked pissed off. since after then he never checked on our table, he never poured our wine, he threw the dessert menu at us while we are still eating the last dishalso salty, and he gave us the bill while we were still eating dessertalso highly seasoned."
1193,Nicole P.,1128,1,12/13/17,what an absolute sht show. this review is not even based on the food. it was the fact that we arrived and put in our name and number for them to contact us when a table was ready because there would be a  min wait. well time passes and we notice a table of  being seated before us and they arrived after we did.. better yet they did not even have to wait that long after being told an hour also. we go in to ask the host why we were not seated yet and he proceeds to tell us he texted my phone and asked where we were and i have proof i did not receive a text. seems they are disorganized and he tried to save himself by telling us oh we have a table ready now if you want to sit. we were standing to wait just outside the windowed patio area in his view so if he texted he simply could have seen us and asked us to come in and the table was ready. worst customer service and we have had a lot of people recommend this place to us as out of towners.
1194,Yako S.,1128,1,12/12/17,"sounds really disgusting! once in a great while, eating a pig might be warranted, after all, they are really intelligent creatures. some people in some areas of our planet also eat dogs, so i guess it is all in the taste buds."
1195,Katrina Y.,1128,1,12/5/17,"seriously, what a fail this place is. the purple pig has been a hype and every one of my friends that went to chicago loved this place, however it absolutely did nothing for me. walked in on a monday night around , did not have to wait at all. we ordered three dishes to share since we were not that hungry coming back from the bulls game. we ordered the fried devil egg, uni toast and this charcuterie meat plate thing. portions are so small and the uni toast was the most disappointing one out of the bunch. it was uni butter, not real uni. it tasted like i cannot believe its not butter, butter. the waiter asked how everything was and i did not hesitate to give a negative facial expression because it was just that bad. not impressed. never will return."
1196,Gokhan M.,1128,1,12/2/17,"this is my first time and i really do not understand the hype. this is a badly managed restaurant with mediocre food. we stopped by friday evening at  to get our names in the waitlist table for . we were told that the wait is  to  minutes. we were finally seated after over an hour. to be honest, i did not mind this too much as their callback system is great. you are sent a text when your table is ready, so you can wait in one of the nearby bars which there are plenty in the area, so not really a big deal. we were seated in a communal table in the middle of two groups. the space is ridiculously small. i do not mind communal tables i dine regularly at avec and publican, the space you get in this restaurant is significantly smaller compared to those in the other two. we could not even put two dishes side by side, the space was that narrow. what is worse was the wait. it took our waiter  minutes to stop by and ask for drinks. when he finally arrived, it was clear why. he assumed we were with the group next to us and since he had taken their orders, he did not come back. this is a big managerial mistake. if you operate communal tables, you need to communicate your waiters the groups much better. if not, you need to educate them to ask group size when they first take orders. this continued throughout the night, we were constantly asked if we ordered something when it was not our order. apparently, they have no way of distinguishing different groups in the communal tables. one the good side, their wine selection is very good. also, i loved having the option of ordering half bottles for a good number of wines. but the markup is rather high i paid  for a bottle of wine which you can find for  outside.  times markup is usual at restaurants, but  times did not feel right. having said that, i liked the wine we ordered at the end. most importantly, the food was mediocre. although we were not really that hungry, we ordered  dishes for two people to get a taste of different things. we started with fried brussel sprouts, which was the only good dish of the night. very simple, but the lemon juice and thyme made it really nice. the second dish was fried olives with chorizo. horrible! the olives were so sour, nothing else can be tasted. next was the bone marrow. bone marrow itself was very good, but the dish comes with a parsleycaper mix nice touch but the parsley was the worst i have had in my life, very rough almost woody. nobody should serve them, particularly not a restaurant calling itself mediterranean inspired. the fourth dish was the house n woulduja. there was really no spice whatsoever in the n woulduja, extremely plain. the final dish was the chestnut mouse and caviar. this really sounded interesting as i am big chestnut favorite. yet, the dish fell short again as the chestnut taste was completely overtaken by the caviar, not balanced at all. i must admit i am a picky eater, particularly when it comes to mediterranean food, but the overall experience was disappointing, particularly for almost  per person."
1197,Nicole C.,1128,1,11/4/17,"it has very unique ingredients in every dish, but that is about all it has going for it. went on a busy saturday night, waited  hrs and never received a call back. we had to go there to remind them we were waiting, then got to sit in the cold entryway with no heaters turned on. their menu is not accurate at all for some itemsfor some reason our steak tips came with a fruity sauce, a sugar sheet, mint and some kind of cracker thing. none of that was mentioned in the description. the wild rice was still hard and crunchy. the pork ribs had ground up bonescartilage in the meat. their breaded broccoli was super salty, and the butternut squash had too much truffles on it. it tasted like soil. then we ordered a raspberry tart dessert that actually tasted great, but you could see the lines on it from being stored in plastic in the fridge. add on innatentive service and attitude from the hostess who assumed we did not wait long enough, and i really cannot recommend it for how much it costs. unless you crave foods with weird combinations of flavors."
1198,Dandan Z.,1128,1,10/30/17,"the food was not tasty at all. ordered octopus, pork shoulder and fried egg. none of them taste good, cannot understand why they have  reviews. most likely they purchased the reviews. the service was terrible as well. i asked them for water in plastic cup for my little kid, but they offered him water in glass without listening and watching. at the end, they automatically charge me  tip from the price including tax instead of the price just for the food without asking. felt not being respected. are you guys really need money? offering better food and services instead! definitely never back! highly not recommend! it is so funny! after my bad review, there was a person seems like a server from the restaurant pretend himself to be a customer and shouted at me about my review. why i said that because he has no photos no reviews no nothing but compliments for me. what a shame!"
1199,Andrew C.,1128,1,10/28/17,"the service is awful! they are constantly under staffed. the bbq is very subpar despite what the prices would suggest. would not recommend anything on the menu but especially avoid the wings, mac& cheese, and burnt ends. do not eat here. i feel violated"
1200,Carrie W.,1128,1,10/24/17,i am giving a  star review because our service was so bad we left before we could order. we were seated immediately but the waiter did not come over for at least  minuets.
1201,Rebecca B.,1128,1,9/3/17,"overpriced, ridiculously small portions. spent nearly  for  and i walked out without having a bite because there was not enough food and what they served was not at all appetizing."
1202,Bobby C.,1128,1,9/2/17,we arrived at pm on a saturday night. they said   hour wait. that is . when i questioned the empty tables. see pic. they said do not question the process. we sat at the bar then got a text in a half hour that our table was ready. the manager and bartenders were condescending pricks.
1203,SP C.,1128,1,8/29/17,"the salt is immense and nauseating. i love salt being from the south. country ham is something i grew up with. this place, they have ingredients that are salty which is fine. yet they manage to abundantly salt each piece of ingredient possible to the point of a southern gal's nausea. then they insisted this is the design intent of the dish. it was immense and commented by other customers. i would suggest asking they forgo the additional salt to preparing dishes at the risk that your vegetables may be unseasoned. there should be plenty of existing seasoning to compensate."
1204,Ricky L.,1128,1,8/29/17,"edit from  stars to  star. i originally gave this place a five star review after i ate here, but when i was going through my receipts after my chicago trip and comparing it to my credit card charges, i saw that they tried to double my tip and overcharge me. i left my original review below in case you still planned to eat here, but make sure to check your credit card statement afterward.  had an amazing experience at the purple pig! it definitely is not cheap by any means, but it is an affordable highend restaurant if you are looking for a nice night out. they are a little pushy and rushy simply because there is so much going on at once in the restaurant, but at least the food came out pretty quickly. the bone marrow and beet salad and pork jowl were amazing foods that were both excitingly new and still delicious! these three dishes made the whole wait worth it the fried pig ear was alright, but a little too oily and nothing to balance it out. the tuna was a major disappointment because it was too salty and there was barely anything on the plate. while there were some dishes that we did not like, i am still giving it a five star review for these innovative dishes that are hard to find anywhere else. it was about ~ for a good filling meal for three people!"
1205,Yuki W.,1128,1,8/24/17,"this place did not live up to all the great reviews that previous guest gave it. first, you do not have your own private table,  of the tables are arranged in a group style so you will be sitting with people that you know nothing about and have nothing in common with. the portions are extremely small and over priced. i believe that food network over rated this place, at best on a scale of  it will get a !!! this is a pack place. however, i do not understand why it took the waitress  mins to just take the bill to the table and another  mins to charge my card..."
1206,Stephanie G.,1128,1,8/11/17,hi! we were waiting for a table last night  when my party noted a large cockroach by us as we were sitting by the back hallway. grossed out  we froze. your cook saw what we were looking at and he stepped on it and asked a coworker to get rid of it. we left and ate elsewhere.
1207,Iliana R.,1128,1,8/5/17,nd time and i will not make it a third. two times i have called and asked about seating for drinks and maybe eating in  minutes. the hostess said sure come on over. we have seats outside for cocktail service. we crossed the street to find a long line of people waiting for tables. she could have mentioned that those seats outside have no tables. i question whether they actually own those chairs. note to management  train your hostesses to set proper expectations. just basic customer service
1208,Tom R.,1128,1,7/23/17,"this is one of the most wtf restaurants i have ever visited. clearly, based on the thousands of glowing reviews from pristine yelp pallets, i am an idiot with too average taste and extremely simple words. or maybe you all work at this place. for brevity, here's what we ordered and why it sucked tomato fritters = fried tomato relish or maybe lumpy ketchup. at once crisp and soggy. a crime scene in the mouth. beef tendon chips, like . fried pork rinds, but  and greasier. stupid. how do you mess up hummus? add a poached egg and some greens, and too little pita. never run out of pita before hummus. come on! fried olives. somehow managed to find  of the smallest olives from a bonsai olive tree and spit a drop of chorizo allegedly in the center, breaded and fried. add a nasty mayonnaise. not even food. like things you make when your fridge loses power. . iced tea in tiny cocktail glasses with no waitstaff in sight. this was actually pretty funny. old fashioned was ok, but even that was not old fashioned missed the cherry. atmosphere was annoying, mostly dumbasses in denial  no different than me except the vehement denial... and skinny jeans. left without dinner predicting more gussied up garbage and sadness.  for crap apps... err small plates. you are better than this chicago, which we found out later and portillo's and pretty much every place else."
1209,Fred M.,1128,2,12/31/17,"everyone knows the children's story the emperor's new clothes. hans christian anderson, wrote the story over  years ago, but i think it applies to the purple pig. four stars and over , reviews? i do not get it. this restaurant has been on my bucket list for years. yesterday, december th i was finally able to check it off my list. my wife and i stoppedin late afternoon, and luckily only had about a  minute wait. the place is tiny, and tables are shoehorned in. to that point, if you are a large person and your table is toward the back of the restaurant, you might have an awkward moment getting to your seat. on to the food i was eager to try the bone marrow i love bone marrow. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. it was very rich, yet bland, is that possible. it was accompanied with some greasy toasted bread. the marrow is greasy enough, why was the bread greasy? in fairness, it probably would have been better, if we were a party of  or maybe . it was too much for two people and became a burden to eat. we also ordered the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes  puffed farro. it tasted like corned beef. i do not like corned beef. the cornbread was good. the cheese platter was average. service was fine. the crowd appeared to be mostly tourists and shoppers. i am glad i finally dined here, but i highly doubt i will ever return."
1210,Edna C.,1128,5,12/31/17,"i think it is safe to say that you cannot really go wrong with any restaurant that has the word pig in it... the salty pig in boston, pig 'n whistle in la, the pig in dc, the wooly pig in sf. chicago's purple pig is the quintessential new american, foodiecentered, trendycasual, hyped up, hourlongwait restaurant serving unique and fun creations ranging from crisp brussels sprouts to pig ears to cured meat and cheese boards. with the motto cheese, swine, and wine and a branded gate entrance alongside the river, it is difficult not to be captivated by the restaurant's charm. they do not take reservations, but there is a decently sized covered tarp with heating ! and tall tables where you can order appetizers and drinks. you can also go for a walk and check out downtown including the impressive candy store, because they have a nice texting system that gives you  minutes to return and claim your table. my biggest issue with the purple pig is the perpetual first world problem of the difficulties deciding what to order. the menu has a large selection of interesting offerings, and this is one of those places you want to return to multiple times before officially crossing it off your bucket list.  assortment of locally foraged mushrooms  in my mind i had the image of a purple pig on a leash foraging for truffles and rare mushrooms. while the mushrooms where less bouge than truffles, it was a satisfying dish with the variety of succulent mushrooms. the hearty, earthy taste paired with the tart purple! berry sauce was a subtle surprise.  pork spare ribs with bbq sauce  farro  omg this is possibly the most meticulously finetuned ribs i have ever had. the meat is so tender it appears to fall off the bone spontaneously, and the flavors are robust with prominent smokey tones, with hints of bacon and ham. i thought the thick overlaying sauce would be overwhelming, but the mix of bbq sauce and creamy yogurtlike drizzle added dimensions of familiarity and novelty. not sure if i could go back to plain old bbq ribs now.  milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes  puffed farro  this was a fascinating dish with the pork so tender and mashed potatoes so creamy, it is of molten consistency that melts in your mouth. it is rather indulgent but not too unbearably rich, because they creatively use pork shoulder infused with milk rather than fatty pork belly. intriguingly, the only contrast is the topping of crispy puffed farro. portions are surprisingly big, and the food is quite filling. although yelp classifies it as tapas, i would not go trigger happy and go on foodie spree while ordering.  plates for  hungry people was plenty, and we could barely finish the food the ambiance is lively and hip, and the details such as the marble tables, branded water carafes and silverware, and stellar food presentation make for excellent photogenic touches. it is definitely of gastropub caliber, and the purple pig would land squarely in the realm of fine dining if they halved their portions, doubled their prices, and placed half of its customers in a quadrupled space at th the noise level."
1211,Janine F.,1128,4,10/5/18,busy spot and sat at a communal table which was nice. got to know people and have entertainment. everyone  couples at the table though received dishes they did not order and had to wait for the proper dish. the waiter did allow us to eat the incorrect dish which turned into a sharing for the whole table dish.
1212,Elena N.,1128,4,12/15/17,"when a spot has over  reviews, i make it a point to check it out. the roommate and i walked in on monday, december th around when they opened at am. luckily, there were only a few parties seated, so we got a table for two right away. the restaurant filled up fairly quickly, so i suggest getting here early as they do not take reservations. pig's ear crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers  fried egg  octopus green beans, fingerling potatoes  salsa verde  ribeye lunch special  nv montsarra, brut, cava, macabeoxarelloparellada  for oz glass we started with the octopus. it was tender with a good chew. and i adored the salsa verde. the whole dish was a touch salty though. the pig ears were my fav. crispy and chewy. the fried egg, kale, and peppers went well with the dish. the ribeye was a special they were offering. meat sounded good, so we decided to get it. this dish was salty as well, but the ribeye was cooked to a nice medium rare. i am more of a rare girl, so this was too cooked for me. i think they precook the steaks as our server said they could not do rare. the restaurant itself is cute. has a lively cafe type of vibe. i did not watch much of the action in the open kitchen as we were seated in one of the tables along the wall, but i can imagine it being entertaining if you were seated at the bar. our server was nice and attentive. recommended the glass of bubbly for me. i would love to come back and try more dishes. since we were on an eating marathon of sorts, we only tried three things. there was so much more i wanted to sample. the purple pig, i will probably be back!"
1213,Mike P.,1128,4,7/3/18,the place is packed at  pm so it should be good. i got lucky and snuck in to a cramped seat at the bar. only really good restaurants are packed this late at night. so i tried the pork tongue based on the bartenders recommendation it was very small portion but the flavor was great. it was like eating bacon. then i had the pork shoulder similar to ozo bucco and it was divine! this place knows what it is doing from top to bottom. prices seemed fair for the quality and location of the place.  i would return again and again until i tried most all of an incredibly appetizing looking menu.
1214,Marissa B.,1128,5,7/2/18,"this place is amazing. it is small portions. the liquor selection is an entire book. i had the pizza, beets and cauliflower. it all was great. definitely recommend if you want excellent food and drinks to share."
1215,Susana D.,1128,4,10/9/18,"we went to purple pig a few times and it never disappoints. the staff is very friendly and very accommodating. we came in with my daughter in a stroller and they made sure we sat comfortably in one of the tables. everything we order was very delicious. the only reason for  stars is the pricing. i think it is a little overpriced. but overall, a must in chicago."
1216,Caro P.,1128,5,10/28/18,"purple pig is a must! community dinning style with amazing dishes. my friend and i shared  dishes broccoli, secreto pork, and oxtail gnocchi. the broccoli was cooked in a lemon anchovy sauce...mind you i do not like anchovies and it was delicious! the secreto pork was a lean tender steak that was garnished with a meyer's lemon sauce, pepper jelly not spicy, and verde sauce which would because a flavor explosion with each bite. lastly, the gnocchi had cinnamon aroma which was deceiving because it did not taste like cinnamon. the gnocchi was very fluffy and the sauce was rich. overall, all the plates were unique and complemented each other."
1217,Lauren B.,1128,5,2/3/18,"the purple pig is a must if you are in chicago. i went with a friend and we took full advantage of the small plates concept by ordering a variety of dishes to compose our meal. at pm on a friday it was quite crowded already. there were open seats at large, shared tables but we opted for some seats at the bar. we ended up getting dinner and a show because we were able to watch the kitchen staff prep the amazing dishes with skilled precision. we ordered the potato croquets which included chorizo and truffle along with some killer sauces. the dish was rich but had the perfect amount of acidity to cut through the fat. the size of the plate three croquets to an order also kept us from getting palate fatigue from the richness. next we order the hummus dish. this dish was surprising as along with the hummus that included whole chickpeas for texture, there was a perfectly soft boiled egg to add another layer of flavor. the hummus came with four pieces of pita for a perfect sharing ratio. our second round of dishes started with the ricotta gnocchi. it was served with what was called neck bone gravy. i have no idea what neck bone gravy is except that i like it. it included some type of braised meat that seemed to have broken down so much it became one with the sauce utterly delicious. it topped the ricotta gnocchi which were the absolutely perfect velvety texture. our final savory dish was the fried brussel sprouts. this sprouts were out of this world. they were the perfectly fried texture, fatty but not greasy, and to cut through the fat was a bright vinaigrette of some kind that made the dish. then it was time for dessert. after downing some excellent quality espresso, we settled in for a piece of chocolate blackout cake and panna cotta. the panna cotta had a smooth, creamy texture and a caramel flavor along with mango sorbet, fresh mango, and a sugary brittle for an added crunch. the chocolate blackout cake was incredibly rich but it was also paired with a bright passion fruit pure that balanced the chocolate flavor nicely. overall, this was an incredible meal. so glad that i was able experience it!"
1218,Irina G.,1128,5,6/14/18,"so happy to have stumbled upon this hidden gem. at first, we were turned off by the name. it is called the purple pig and we do not eat pork so we thought we would not be able to have anything on the menu... but the place kept popping up so we decided to look at the menu and give it a go. to our surprise there were tons of none pig options and the food was amazing. we came on a busy weekend in the summer. they do not take reservations and we had to put our name on the list for an hour wait. it was worth every second. chicago is known for its foodie scene and this place fits right into the reason for the hype. the most memorable dish was the duck  it is a big serving and my husband did not leave the table till he finished it and could barely breathe. he could not stop and said it was the best duck he had in his life. the appetizers were also amazing as was dessert and the best part was that we did not have to break the bank to come here. we stayed in chicago for two days and came here twice we would have come back again if we had more time. a must try and i hope something similar would open in our area one day..."
1219,Christa C.,1128,4,12/22/17,"fantastic!! my food met so many expectations. i was traveling alone and managed to snag a seat at the bar with no wait when the wait for a party of  was almost  hrs, yikes!. i love the fun items on their menu i ordered the duck prosciutto, roasted bone marrow, and burrata cannoli. my favorite was the duck prosciutto  sliced incredibly thinly and truly melted in my mouth! the bone marrow was also stellar, so much umami! the burrata cannoli, while still good, was my least favorite of the three. most of its pricetag is probably the osetra caviar, otherwise it was small for the price and i actually prefer the texture of fresh burrata over the whipped burrata in the dish. seating and service was a bit more of a struggle. with the crazy crowds, the seats at the bar, at least were cramped and tightly packed. it was impossible to get a menu in a timely manner with our server running around, but luckily everyone at the bar was super polite and we ended all sharingpassing around a copy of the menu. in fact, by the time my server came to give me a menu, i already looked through and picked all the items i wanted. overall, great meal! it is so busy and cramped, but still worth the visit!"
1220,Gina P.,1128,5,12/5/17,"recommended by michael c i knew i had to hit up purple pig while i was in the windy city. we were hoping to go there for brunch but when we showed up there was a  hour wait. we decided to still put our name in and walk around a bit and come back when they texted. you have  minutes to return back once they text you. the wine list is huge. it is like biblical proportions. they have it separated by region and country. very cool. their menu has a lot of creative options and changes seasonally. it is is tapas style so make sure you are open to sharing. we ordered bone marrow, broccoli, and a charcuterie platter. all the food came out great and the service was amazing. price point is a little high for wine and also for food but it is really good quality stuff. i would definitely be frequenting purple pig often if i lived in chicago."
1221,Bob W.,1128,3,11/3/18,visited pm on a friday . the whipped feta cheese appetizer was excellent. the ham croque signora was also excellent although it is tough to share. the deviled egg was terrible. my daughter does not think it was an egg. i looked more like a hand molded rice with yellow sauce that was deep fried. do not order the deviled egg! photos included. worse was that the waiterwaitress never asked how we like our food. they could care less. i wrote on the check that their deviled egg was terrible. maybe they can fire the chef.
1222,Danielle S.,1128,4,9/29/18,"great restaurant and fun location! i had eaten here and loved in quite a few times before i became a vegetarian. i do allow myself to sometimes eat a pescatarian diet, and i was able to find some things on this menu to fit that flexibility. but i still highly recommend the purple pig! plus if you are a wine drinker they have a phenomenal wine list."
1223,Adaria T.,1128,5,6/1/18,"this is my first time in chicago, and this was the first restaurant that my husband and i ate at. i absolutely loved it! to be honest, i am not sure if i have eaten better food elsewhere, and i am from california. first off, the atmosphere is great. it was crowded with people, all the servers were super friendly and sweet, we could see the bar and the kitchen from where we sat, and the decor was pretty cool as well. secondly, i love the whole idea behind the restaurant. here you have amazing mediterranean dishes that are served tapas style. i thought that was great! my husband and i ordered several items to share between the two of us, and it was the perfect amount of food green chickpea  hummus, deviled egg, housemade gyros under the meat section, and ricotta gnocchi. for dessert, we had a sicilian iris, and i enjoyed a coffee drink called carajillo. so yummy!!! if you are ever in the chicago area, i highly recommend this place! i am pretty sure you will not be disappointed. if my husband and i come back to chicago, this place is a must on our list!"
1224,Akhil M.,1128,5,8/12/18,"after the st.patricks day saturday filled with cheap beer and jameson, i was in dire need of a sunday morning feast to quell my aching head. the purple pig did not disappoint. for my drink i ordered a spicy bloody mary which was great, tasted fresh and not like the premixed tomato mix. i also ordered the bone marrow and deviled eggs which were both amazing. i wish i took pictures but there was no chance once i started eating! my entree was a medium rare steak with a savory balsamic reduction. it was cooked to perfection and the side salad was great too. highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!"
1225,A T.,1128,5,8/26/18,made a last minute decision to come here. i called and they said there was no wait. i took a lyft here and a couple inside said they enjoyed their meal there  days ago. i asked the waiter which meal was popular and he said the octopus. i tried that and it was awesome. i then asked for an appetizer recommendation and he recommended the ribeye meat with a funky cheese. that combo was off the hook! best combo delicious meal i have had. it was the perfect marriage of flavors accompanied by sweet pickles and jelly. the flavor of stars aligned s wow. i will be back there before i head home.
1226,Felix V.,1128,5,10/26/18,"the best pork belly ever. lots of great dishes to chose from. gets crowded quick, so get there early."
1227,Hala N.,1128,5,9/21/18,"probably one of my favorite spots on chicago's magnificent mile. the atmosphere is lively, and communal. the menu is a selection of flavorful mediterranean fusion plates designed for sharing. the portions are just the right amount. great service received!"
1228,Roxanna L.,1128,4,9/15/18,"menu was extremely extensive. flavors were good, but nothing truly mindblowing. it is a cross between traditional southern cuisine and rustic cooking with a modern kick. portions were very large, so you definitely will not go home hungry here. i would recommend eating in a group if you want to have room to try different things. if you are vegetarian, they also have plenty of things on the menu for you to try. there is something for everyone."
1229,Lauren W.,1128,5,10/11/18," stars. all of the stars. i have never laughed in delight upon the first bite of any food, ever. the pork belly changed all of that. yep, it is busy. yep, you will have to wait. do it and thank me later."
1230,Tina Y.,1128,5,7/29/18,"this experience was better than the first. i was not a big fan of the bone broth last time i came,although it was very popular...lots of people were ordering it. the whipped feta cheese was so delicious. there was a hint of acidityvinegar? in the whipped feta that was refreshing, well accented by the pickled banana peppers. who would have thought that a barbecueketchup type sauce would complement it so well? it was so good, i ate the whole thingnot my plan. the roasted cauliflower was very good. the citrus really brightened the dish. the scallops were quite good served with a romesco saucered peppers, tomatoes and hazelnut and creamy polenta. the pig ear was very interesting, salty and crisp, like a bowl of potato chips with a sunny side up egg on top of fried kale and onions. atmosphere is professional yet relaxed, high energy. i have had some great conversations at the bar while in chicago for business. it is always seems to be busy but i have never had to wait long if at all. tapas that is a cut above. staff was friendly and helpful. highly recommend whipped feta"
1231,Han N.,1128,5,10/7/18,"located in the loop, this place has some very tasty small plates. i went with a large group and we pretty had every plate on the menu."
1232,Lily F.,1128,4,7/3/17,"the server suggested  dishes for  people. clearly you underestimate our eating abilities. we ordered  octopus, bone marrow, berkshire shoulder, broccoli, goat cheese with honey and the lemon bar. the two best dishes were easily the broccoli i know, right?! and the octopus, which was not only crazy tender, but had the most perfect char on it. honestly, those two dishes alone would be enough for me to revisit. the broccoli had this addicting sauce that coated every inch of it and it was just as good as girl and the goat's broccoli. vegetables really stepped up their game lately. the only criticism is that the restaurant was a little too loud for me to hear my friend comfortably. and because it is on michigan avenue, it is also extremely busy, even for a thursday evening. we ended up having a slight mixup with one of our dishes and did not get it until much later. but it was the octopus dish and well worth the wait!"
1233,Kerri M.,1128,4,9/23/18,"went here for an early snackdinner. they were switching from lunch to dinner so we had to wait for the dinner menu. it was supposed to be ready at , but we did not get it until . we were not in a rush so we did not mind, but maybe avoid the lunchdinner transition time. we had the pork fat fried almonds. these were really addictive! so salty and warm and all that yummy pork fat. i recommended it. the chicharones were good, but we are dusted with this powder that was tasty, but just kind of heavy on the top of the plate. i would shake it off before eating a piece. it may make you cough when you breathe it in. the polenta was amazing. the burratta foam was something i cannot wait to try and replicate. if you like small tasting plates and cocktails i would say this place is a good bet. the lunch menu seemed a bit more basic whereas the dinner menu had a bit more funk, so you can gauge when is best to go."
1234,Kelly Z.,1128,4,8/16/17,"we waited for about . hours for our table. during the wait, we hung out in the front of the restaurant and ordered a few drinks, where there were servers walking around taking orders. we ordered a few dishes but the only ones, i did remember were the ones i took pictures of. the dishes here are tapas, so make sure to order a few so you get your bellies full and get a taste of their extensive menu. they have something for everyone! the pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg  was eggceptional!! we also ordered the beef coppa steak, which comes with pommery mayo, radishes and preserved tomatoes . this dish was sweet and savory and really hit the spot."
1235,Eddie U.,1128,5,7/5/18,i came for my birthday and man you were superb in food and service. i always recommend you like if i had some type of personal kick back but i do not. i just know one good thing when i see it and that is you
1236,Giselle F.,1128,4,1/15/18,"i went to purple pig for my second time with a friend visiting from nashville. i have taken  friends out of state here and both have loved it. this place does not take reservations so come prepared for that. we came were here while it was cold and were quoted a  minute wait and stood by their outdoor heaters to wait. the wait was definitely less than  minutes as we told the hostess it did not matter if we were seated out side or inside. outside is covered and heated as well!  the prices are up there but the food and taste explosions are well worth it! this a communal sitting type place, its loud and fun and you get to meet new people while trying amazing food! i started with the vinho verde ros and my friend started with a colombian old fashioned. we were here for some late dinner tapas. we had the spare ribs, morcillalobster and cottonwood cheddar cheese. our server, mauro b., was awesome & colombian which two colombian girls really appreciated  he had alot of knowledge on the plates and gave us great recommendations, not only on what to eat but where to go for a drink afterwards. my friend wan't very fond of her colombian old fashioned just not her style of drinking and mauro took that off the bill at the end of the night! thank you for all your help mauro! i will more than likely make my way back in the summertime!"
1237,Regina O.,1128,5,12/19/17,"if you are ever in chicago, you need to make time to go to the purple pig. my girlfriends and i waited about  mins for a table but the wait was definitely worth it. its nice because you can order drinks while you wait and they have a couple seats outside as well. we ordered a ton of different dishes to try and share among my  girlfriends and i. we ordered calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumbers  pistachios  half a dozen oysters  milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes  puffed farro  octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes  salsa verde  pig ear's with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers  fried egg  half duck confit with greek yogurt, smoked trout roe  brioche buns  truffle gnocchi  i definitely recommend the calamari, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder and the truffle gnocchi! the calamari dish was super fresh and light. the octopus was grilled and cooked to perfection. it was not too chewy but tender and it was seasoned perfectly. the milk braised pork shoulder is a popular item for a reason. the meat falls apart easily and literally melts in your mouth! so tender and flavorful, it also paired very well with the creamy mashed potatoes it came with. the truffle gnocchi... wow just wow. i think this was my favorite dish and i would highly recommend you order this. bites of heaven. the pig ears was interesting but not something i would order again or recommend. we actually got two of these because my friend took a bite and pulled out the longest piece of hair from her mouth from the first dish. we flagged down the waiter and told him quietly because we did not want to because a scene so he took it away and brought out a new one for us. i kind of expected them to waive that dish but they did not.. no big deal although it would have been nice. overall, purple pig did not disappoint and definitely lived up to the hype and reviews. service was good, food was delicious and pricing was reasonable. i would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting chicago and i definitely would not mind coming back again."
1238,Alexandra P.,1128,5,8/26/17,"what stood out even more than the food which was incredible was the fact that the service was phenomenal. when we arrived we were greeted by two separate waitstaff offering water and to explain the menu. throughout the meal they checked in clearing plates, refilling water and confirming our satisfaction of the dishes but we are never invasive. the drink menu options alone can make you dizzy in a good way, and the menu is set up for sharing with everything from cheese and charcuterie selections to chicken kabobs over smashed potatoes. so. many. choices! everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and beautifully displayed. i highly recommend this spot whether you are a chitown native or taking in the windy city over a whirlwind weekend visit."
1239,Cameron M.,1128,3,12/26/17,"overrated. i was in chicago for business and wanted to escape restaurants in the loop, so met a chicagoan friend for a weeknight dinner. the restaurant was packed with a minute wait, but we happily put our name down and flipped through the nicely curated beverage menu. my friend, who frequented the purple pig in the past, was excited for me to try the turkey leg confit and pork shoulder. we were seated at a communal table across from a trumpesque brazenly creepy drunk dude, reminding me of my hatred for communal tables, and struggled to keep our plates from getting mixed up with other patrons' plates. the wait staff had to keep reaching around and over us to service the other guests who were along the window. octopus, turkey leg confit, something green that was not memorable, and the pork shoulder. salty. everything was freakishly oversalted! the pork shoulder arrived near room temperature, so we had to send it back i have only sent something back for being cold once before in my life at a red robin burger joint, so no snobbiness here and the same pork shoulder returned resauced and heated to warm. turkey leg confit was simply too salty to continue eating, although the surrounding veggies were crisp and flavorful. the octopus was fine, but of lower quality. this meal left me wishing for something exciting to remember it by. i suggest you order the octopus and other mediterranean fare at nearby restaurant ƒíma and skip the purple pig. sorry chef jimmy bannos jr.!"
1240,Pam W.,1128,5,7/1/17,"wow! this place is good. it is also super busy, even on a wednesday night. i am often in chicago and love this city for so many reasons, especially its terrific food scene. we were staying at the intercontinental right across the street, which i highly recommend. i have heard a lot about purple pig but have not made it to the restaurant before now. a few things you should know they do not take reservations, so it is first come, first served. be prepared to wait. waiting for a table is not bad because you can grab a drink and enjoy it in their patio area. they have an extensive wine list, so if you are a wine drinker, you will have lots of options. but note that their wines are pricey by the glass, so if a few of you are having wine, just share a bottle. okay, back to the review. we arrived around  and put our name on the list. they take your phone number so they can text you when the table is ready. they give you a minute window to get to the restaurant, so you could check in and then visit some local stores. we were just starting a second glass of wine and beer when they texted. we headed to the host stand and while we waiting in line to get our table, a woman went to the front of the line and was very rude to everyone. she was clearly angry and was saying she was in line before everyone and we all cut the line. the host handled it perfectly, telling her that she would help the folks in line then would assist her. i hope she was embarrassed because she made an a of herself. we were at a twotop table and were quickly greeted by our server, who explained the menu and made some recommendations. their menu has so many great options! we opted for a variety of dishes to share, including chorizostuffed olives, deepfried egg, fava bean pure, crispy pigs ears, secreto smoked pork dish, and lamb and pork kefedes. everything was great! little touches elevated each dish...pickled okra with the fried deviled egg, microgreens with the chorizostuffed olives, cayenne in the kale with the pigs ears...i am making myself hungry! if you have not tried the purple pig, go now! you will have an awesome, memorable and craveworthy meal."
1241,Jess G.,1128,5,1/15/18,"the purple pig, is an iconic, michelin star restaurant, located on michigan ave in chicago's magnificent mile shopping district. the head chef here, jimmy bannos jr, was named chicago's rising star chef , so you know the food is delicious. myself and my group decided to come here at about  pm on a sunday afternoon. we were lucky to only have to wait about  mins for seats so if you plan to come on a more popular day or time you will need reservations. the seating is mostly community style at a long table, so it can get a little cramped but it is worth it. the atmosphere felt upscale without feeling pretentious. the decor was simple but the pops of color around the dining area caught my eye. for drinks my friends ordered wine while i went for the vadermill hard cider that was on the menu. as our very knowledgeable and helpful server mentioned, the cider was much more dry that your typical cider, which i thought was delicious. the purple pig has a pretty extensive wine and cocktail menu as well, sure to please anyone. for food, the purple pig serves a series of mediterranean style small plates, sides, cured meats, and a variety of cheeses. myself and one of my friends decided to create our own cheese and meat tray after seeing the high quality and variety of the cheeses offered. for cheeses we got the boxcarr rocket's robiola, the up in smoke, and a black truffle cheese that i cannot remember the name of. for our meats we picked the chorizo, capocollo, and an italian style prosciutto. the board came with baked pita crackers, an apple puree, cranberry jam, and a nut and honey mixture that tasted just like baklava. each of the cheese had amazing flavors that truly amazed me. the cured meats paired nicely with the cheese and presented unique flavors of their own. additionally, each of the spreads paired nicely with the meats and cheeses but i choose to mostly enjoy them between cheeses to cleanse the palette. the purple pig is a wonderful culinary experience, that is sure to please any foodie in chicago."
1242,Sophis M.,1128,2,5/22/18,"kind of hated this restaurant, got to be honest. apparently it is very hard to get a reservation but i was able to land a table rather quickly. i am not sure how i just mentioned my mom and i where very hungry to the hostess. my mom had some sort of octopus, it tasted scary. squishy and cold. not sure if that is what it is mente to taste like. i ordered the ham steak. tasted like ham and steak. service was not good at all, took no joke  minutes to get a simple drink order  diet cokes and then another  minutes to get food order. not cool not nice and then on top of that our food comes out cold was not happy."
1243,Katherine L.,1128,5,8/8/17,"it is so easy to miss this place because it is kinda tucked in from the magnificent mile michigan ave, but it is so good! based on all the reviews on yelp, it seems like there is always a long wait. however, i lucked out and only had to wait  minutes on lolapalooza sunday around pm!! i saw that they had a postit note estimating how long the wait would be based on what time of day it is, so do not give up when the host tells you that the wait is super long! be patient, and walk around magnificent mile while you are at it! my party of  got sat down  minutes after we signed in, and we were seated at the high top communal style table. it was pretty crammed, but not going to complain since we barely had to wait. the waitress was very nice and talked us through the menu, which changes twice daily according to her anyway!! so do not be surprised if you see something on yelp that you want to try, but is not on the menu  the  of us shared an octopus asparagus dish, duck confit, pork malnati, a pasta dish, and the bone marrow. the bone marrow and the duck were to die for!! the bone marrow was not too oily, and it was not overcooked. the duck was juicy and tender as if it would melt in your mouth! the octopus was not chewy at all, and everything tasted great. i am so glad i got to check this place out while i was at chicago, and this place definitely lived up to its expectations.  would recommend!"
1244,Nerissa T.,1128,4,6/29/17,"i was quite surprised that we scored a table on the patio right away on monday afternoon. i came here a few years ago when i first visited chicago so i was excited to be back. we skipped the cured meats and pork dishes this time around since we wanted a lighter lunch but it is a must if you are a first timer. we decided on the calamari, grilled octopus, and pig's ear.  calamari very refreshing, more of a salad type dish. i really like the fregola and the pistachios added a nice texture.  grilled octopus perfection! the octopus was very tender and the salsa verde had great flavors.  pig's ear it was a bit oily and too salty for me. it came with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and a fried egg on top. the pickled peppers did help tone some of the saltiness down. they have a great wine list and food here is excellent. like everyone has already mentioned, be prepared for a wait if you coming during the evening but it is definitely worth a visit!"
1245,Bob P.,1128,5,8/9/18,"in chicago for a college tour and needed a place for lunch. not wanting to hit some fast food chain, i pulled up trusty yelp imho. purple pig was  blocks away. a little more  than i wanted for a quick lunch with my so. but i figured why not eat a little better on a couple day vacay. it was insane!!  kind of like tapas but the plates are a little bigger which is nice. got the polenta and tomatoes. perfect. just the right savory. then tuna and then meatballs.  great dishes and not too full  just right at roughly  a plate. definitely worth it for such great food. highly recommend."
1246,Monica S.,1128,4,8/16/18,"service was fair and the atmosphere was great. it was a bit pricier than we expected because we learned it is tapas style read the the portions are kind of small, and that is the only reason i do not give five stars. but the food was absolutely delicious. we were in chicago for our honeymoon and tried a lot of highly rated restaurants, and we both agreed the purple pig was the tastiest. also, if you can get there as they open i would recommend it. we happened to arrive  minutes after open and we were seated immediately. within  minutes the entire restaurant was full and there was a wait. popular location."
1247,Trang N.,1128,4,6/19/17,"the wait is finally over! we finally got a chance to dine at this wildly popular restaurant in chicago. it was definitely a good experience but personally i do not think it is a fivestar experience. being a typical tourist, i practically ordered everything that were recommended and most popular. we started with the beef tendon chips and some rose sangria. the chips were crunchy and savory rose sangria was refreshing and perfect sweetness. truly star experience and great for happy hour. then we had the pig's ear and pork jowl jlt sandwich. though the ingredients and names are interesting and creative, we did not the food lived up to the expectations.  stars. lastly, we had the grilled octopus and it was quite good! the octopus was tender and juicy... probably best entree out of everything we ordered that night. we also wanted to get dessert but none of the options on yelp was available then."
1248,Muffadal S.,1129,5,10/28/18,i have been here twice and there is a line out the door. i think this is the best bbq in chicago. my mouth still waters for the brisket. the owners are passionate about bbq and it shows. the only problem is that it is a drive to get their from the burbs. best brisket and carolina bbq sauce. my recommendation is that you try it
1249,Lady J.,1129,4,10/25/18,"five stars for the taste of everything i ordered which was basically brisket platter, cole slaw and corn bread and fountain drink iced tea. you do not even need a knife to eat the meat, it is that tender. delish!! i thought i would take some home but ate every delicious bite. i am not a regular meat eater so this was a treatsin and i would say worth it! slaw could have used a tad more umph, though nice to not have mayo drenched slaw but maybe a bit more seasoning just the same. cornbread was still warm and pretty moist and the sauces were both good that they provide for the brisket. i took off a star for the person seating and the person at the register. we got seated under the menu butted up against the wall where everyone would be staring at us to read the menu in a semi empty restaurant, there were better tables for us. plus the counter person did not engage enough to explain anything, ask any questions or inform that there are default sauces and if you want spicy you can ask.  also i wish they did not have so much single use plastic in there.  the sauces are in plastic containers, plastic straws are still being used, plastic lids too, perhaps for the dining in they can put sauce in paper cups and get paper and wax straws...then i bump to five stars.  the person who gave us the stinky table did ask us if we were enjoying our meal and i did say yes, except the table! he apologized..next time we just speak up. i did not speak up this time as i was taking in the menu, surroundings and getting my bearings. i thought the price was reasonable for the very high quality of the food and look forward to going back next time i am indulging in eating some brisket again."
1250,Jimmy C.,1129,4,10/16/18,"quick and delicious. so many people recommend this place to me because i live in the area. decent outdoor seating and the ribs were, of course, some of the best in the city"
1251,Lois L.,1129,5,10/11/18,there is a reason smoque is always busy!! their food is so amazing. the best barbecue i have ever had in chicago!!! beef brisket is always a go to and i actually love the coleslaw here and i usually hate coleslaw!! there is really nothing to go into detail with here. it is a great place. it is busy. it is worth it. enough said!!
1252,Suzan H.,1129,3,8/20/18,i had every intention to really love this place after eyeing up all the pictures and reading all the reviews but this place is aok and nothing more. the chopped brisket was a bit dry and kind of cold. the cornbread did not have much flavor and the mac n cheese was too wateryish. the sauces were good but nothing great. this place is not worth any wait at all. i would say give it a try if it is convenient but do not go out of your way for this place.
1253,Robert S.,1129,5,8/16/18,"wow...what great joint. i ordered a half slab of st louis ribs and a side of sliced brisket.  both were excellent.  tender, nicely seasoned, very very good.  the brisket was so tender, it just melted in my mouth.  six pieces of ribs, brisket, fries, mac and cheese and slaw was a lot of food....maybe next time, i can split with a friend and get only  ribs, the brisket and share a side dish. great staff, very clean, very busy."
1254,Dave W.,1129,5,8/4/18,"we had a proper memphisstyle bbq dinner here during our tour of chicago. while the ribs and pulled pork and brisket were wonderful, the star of the show was the notonthemenu candies jalapeos! sweet yet slightly spicy, these little atomic morsels were unique and delicious! we also enjoy the brisket chili which was packed with flavor! the best part was the friendly and helpful service. everyone took care of us, taking away our dishes, and bringing us togo containers when it was time to hit the road. as for drinks, they only have the soft variety but they have no issue with byob. so, byob we did!"
1255,Nancy R.,1129,5,10/30/18,"this place is the best bbq ribs in town everything was so delicious, coleslaw, fries and mac and cheese. customer service excellent"
1256,Tina V. W.,1129,4,8/3/18,"if one is a customer who has never smoked meat, this restaurant is a solid stars. if you are someone who has smoked meat, this restaurant is a  to   star restaurant a bbq smoker aficionado will be able to smoke better food...but, then, it is a pain in the boongie to pack a  lb smoker in your checkedin luggage.  the restaurant is clean. the service is polite and quick. this is what i had for  meals pickled jalepenos scrumptious!! the heat of the jalepenos was nicely balanced by the slight sweetness. strange, but great flavor combination. beans decent. warning taste these before eating the brisket chile. once you eat the brisket chile, you do not want to stop. yes, the brisket chile is to die for. oh...the beans...yes the beans are good. but, psssssttttt...the brisket chile is better!! brisket chile you will thank the bbq gods for this side dish. coleslaw refreshing, yummy, delicioso, delizioso, dlicieux, kstlich, , oishƒ..you get the picture. this is a fantastic vinegary, nomayo coleslaw. made of cabbage & radish. pulled pork delicious and moist. unlike most bbq places, they actually serve you pork with the smoke ring. most bbq places we have been to most of them highlyrated in yelp, do not serve you any meat with the smoke ring. the smoke ring is a sign that the meat has been smoked properly. also, most bbq places do not inject their pulled pork. so, if the bbq restaurant is not smoking the pulled pork for  hours, do not add additional rub to the pulled pork, andor do not inject their pulled pork with marinade, you will end up with bland pork. my husband & i have just smoked pork during july th...we will eventually become bbq smoking ninjas.  cornbread basic. sigh brisket boring. it was a bit dry. according to their website, the deep, rich smoke flavor is complemented by a layer spice rub. sorry, but, there was absolutely no spice rub or smoke flavor in the  lb to  lb of brisket that i had. luckily, i was able to use the carolina and spicy memphis bbq sauces to flavor the brisket. great pulled pork and surprisingly wonderful side dishes. there is something for everyone at this restaurant."
1257,Bridget M.,1129,5,11/1/18,"amazing. the rumors are true. i had the baby back ribs with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw and, although it was so much food, i wanted to keep eating. slow cooked and smoked for hours, this bbq does not disappoint. nestled on a quiet corner, smoque provides a laid back atmosphere with counter ordering and a casual interior. they will help you find somewhere to sit after you order. it gets packed, so eat then get up for someone else to enjoy this incredible bbq. arguably the best in the city. i will recommend this place to anyone who says they are in the mood for bbq and i will definitely be back."
1258,Rebecca X.,1129,4,7/17/18,"solid bbq for the midwest. you order your food first and then one of the smoque employees directs your group to a seating area. the place was busy but the wait was not too bad, maybe  minutes this was  pm on a weeknight. my group of  decided to share a bunch of stuff . lb of sliced brisket, full slab of baby back ribs, large bbq beans, large mac & cheese, large fresh cut fries, and  cornbreads. we chose sliced brisket over chopped for its higher fat content, definitely worth the extra calories. included with the order were  types of sauce memphis style, spicy memphis style, carolina style. the spicy memphis was my favorite  i dipped everything in it! while the four of us were able to finish everything, we were absolutely stuffed. we probably should have gotten one less side and stuck with  lb of brisket. i thought the brisket was the star of the show. it was super tender and juicy and tasted amazing with any of the sauces. ribs were good, nice and smokey. out of all the sides we got, i enjoyed the beans and fries the most. i am not usually a beans type of person, but the smoque version was bursting with flavor. the fries were hot and fresh and tasted great dipped in bbq sauce. cornbread was decent although i could not tell you what constitutes good cornbread i might have been too full to appreciate it. the biggest disappointment was the mac & cheese. the large we got was simply two of their preportioned containers, which are pretty small. honestly it tasted pretty bland and the texture was not creamy or cheesy whatsoever. would skip next time. overall, i would come back here for the meat, though i am not too excited about those sides."
1259,Joseph Carlo V.,1129,5,7/8/18,"i have been told about this place & how it is one of the best bbq in the city. therefore, this place had some high expectations from me.. & it they were met and exceeded! located a block down and right past the interstate on pulaski and irving park, smoque is in its own tiny hot spot. i came here for dinner on a weekday night right before the line grew outside the doors. the menu is small, which is ideal for an indecisive person like me...but has all the essential american bbq options like ribs baby back & st. louis style, brisket, chicken, pull pork, and sausage. also, most entrees include a couple sides with the meal and coleslaw. sides are fries, brisket chili, mac and cheese, cornbread, and beans. i had the chopped brisket with slaw, mac&cheese, and cornbread. man oh man, the mac&cheese was a small serving but soft, fluffy, and delicious! the cornbread is equivalent to the child of famous dave's cornbread if you know, they have the best cornbread ever with corn inside. lastly, my food came with a caroline bbq sauce & and memphis style bbq sauce that i would interchangeably switch back and forth on my brisket. oooo baby, it was a good, quick bite that came out pretty quick! mark my word, i will be back to get some of those good good ribs i saw others had. "
1260,Robinsue B.,1129,5,9/29/18,"delicious! used smoque bbq for catering for the last two events i have thrown and they do not disappoint! we got the brisket , grilled chicken and cornbread and everyone was very pleased! the bbq sauces are very tasty. for catering, they did a great job estimating the amount of food we would need based on guest count and also provided utensils, napkins and prompt delivery service and set up."
1261,Amirtha U.,1129,5,7/19/18,"soo i was super excited to try this place out and i was not disappointed. the brisket was out of this world. i had a smile on my face the entire time, it was so juicy and delicious...i only wish i had a bigger appetite so i could eat more. definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. i actually ended up going to the one that is in the food hall and it was such a cute lunch spot! oh and i also need to mention that the mac and cheese was absolutely amazing....there was lots of cheese in that...so just be aware if you are a bit on the sensitive side. i am....but either way, it was so worth it."
1262,Michael H.,1129,4,10/27/18,"the barbecue was wonderful. it is so difficult to get that dark crusty surface with a moist and tasty inside. on the downside, i think they could make it work a little better if they took reservations or even when you are there they could give you a number or a beeper to indicate that your food is ready. also we had memphis bbq sauce and i kind of prefer the kansas city variety. on the plus side, they let you bring your own alcohol in you have to open it yourself per city rules. if i were rating on the food alone, it would definitely be five star but i think they could make the set up for ordering and delivery better."
1263,Caprice F.,1129,5,9/4/18,"i am from st. louis, and i was quite skeptical about getting bbq in chicago, but i was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was at smoque! they have really good bbq, very good portions, and the prices are not bad. i got a half slab of stl ribs with mac n cheese, fries, and coleslaw for an early dinner on saturday. we had about a  minute wait in the line to order, and then a  minute wait for our food. it was surprising that the food took so long to arrive, but the food was fresh and hot when our names were finally called. my cousin and her friend both ordered the double meat brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, and it was a ton of meat. all of us enjoyed our food and were pleasantly surprised by how good the coleslaw was. it has really good flavor and is not your typical coleslaw. the watermelon iced tea and sweet tea are also winners!"
1264,Jeremy S.,1129,5,11/10/18,"everything was great, especially the bbq gumbo and a nice spin on the smoked beans. nice work smoque crew."
1265,Rommel Q.,1129,5,9/5/18,amazing service! efficient and friendly staff. bar none one of the best bbqs i have had.
1266,Jein P.,1129,5,5/27/18,"one of my favorite bbq spots in all of chicago! this is backed up by the fact that smoque is guy fieri approved. i came here on a late friday afternoon and the restaurant was not busy at all, though i would not expect the same for for weekend lunch or dinners. we ordered the pulled pork sandwich, bbq beef brisket, and the gumbo. we definitely could have gone without the gumbo but the sandwich and brisket was prepared just the way i like meat  extremely flavorful and moist. it does not seem like a lot of food at first but once you start eating, the meat fills you up really quickly. i would absolutely come back to smoque and look forward to the next time that i do. i think it is a chicago bbq essential highly highly recommend this place to not only meat lovers, but people who feel indifferent towards bbq."
1267,Chrissy D.,1129,5,10/22/18,the shredded brisket was amazing. great flavor. i had the corn bread with mac n cheese on the side. everything was delicious. the french fries are fresh cut and soooo good. we will definitely go back
1268,Katie H.,1129,5,11/6/18,"loved the brisket ! was nervous about only two sauce options since i can be picky, but both were good memphis style was the best though. mac & cheese is baked and topped with breadcrumbs. definitely need to try this place!"
1269,Muffadal S.,1129,5,10/28/18,i have been here twice and there is a line out the door. i think this is the best bbq in chicago. my mouth still waters for the brisket . the owners are passionate about bbq and it shows. the only problem is that it is a drive to get their from the burbs. best brisket and carolina bbq sauce. my recommendation is that you try it

1271,Kenneth B.,1129,5,10/16/18,"i do not know much about brisket . i have had it maybe  different occasions during my  years, but this stuff right here! i mean the brisket they serve at smoque! beats the pants off any other brisket i have had. my only complaint is the consistency. i do not know the mechanics of smoking but the doneness of a particular order can sometimes vary. i have had an order that was a little rare for my taste and i haver had an order that was overdone. any time i had a problem though, the staff fixed it with no problem. this is a great place."
1272,Adrian R.,1129,5,10/12/18,"really great bbq joint, makes you almost forget you are in chicago. tried a full run of their offerings from pulled pork, to brisket , to ribs, to chicken. and ordered straight down the line for sides. everything was considered, differentiated in flavor, and on point. will be back very soon. also the owner is a real sweetheart."
1273,Brandon N.,1129,5,10/6/18,"definitely some of the best bbq you will get in the city. i got the brisket and it was some of the best tasting brisket i had in a while. the ribs, chicken and pulled pork are cooked well and are all good options. the macaroni and cheese here is good. i would definitely try it. peach cobbler is tasty. i honestly cannot say i had a bad item on the menu. the few times i went there was a line out the door so obviously the word is out this the spot to get bbq. do not let this deter you, the line goes by pretty smoothly and it is worth the wait."
1274,Milena C.,1129,5,10/5/18,"i went today for the first time and i had ribs with cornbread, coleslaw and the beans. the food was very very delicious and i will definitely come back and i will try the brisket next time. it is worth it, guys!"
1275,Danielle W.,1129,5,10/4/18,holy cow i cannot believe i did not know this place. to have barbecue like this really close to where i live is a blessing. the pulled pork and brisket are awesome. st louis ribs are to die for. so glad this place is here.

1277,John K.,1129,5,9/9/18,favorite brisket and mac are fire everything is excellent and definitely deserves all the critical claim it is chicago's best bbq overall
1278,Ellarey M.,1129,5,9/9/18,"awesome barbecue. lately i have opted to get this delivered on caviar instead of braving the line in avondale, and it is just as delicious. i usually go with the brisket platter and either mac n cheese or corn bread, but always a peach cobbler. i do not think you can really go wrong here."
1279,Karina S.,1129,3,9/4/18,this place is starting to lose its spark. we just bought some food and it is bland. the mac and cheese taste over cooked and not cheesy like usual. my brisket has way too much fat on it and it is just gross. please do not lose your quality.
1280,Kulee X.,1129,5,9/2/18,"eat in or order takeout. everything was delicious. the brisket melts in your mouth. i did not even need sauce, it was so good. the st. louis ribs smoked flavor was perfect. the sides were really good and not too heavy. the coleslaw was fresh. i loved that the cornbread had bits of corn in it and it was not too dry. the beans were also really good and light, it had chunks of smoked meat in it."
1281,Richard H.,1129,5,9/1/18,"sliced beef brisket sandwich best in the chicago area bun  outstanding meat  juicy, taste so good it does not need sauce house sauce  excellent coleslaw  excellent baked beans  wow"
1282,abby k.,1129,5,8/24/18,excellent food and service. brisket is tender and tasty. mac and cheese is scrumptious but portion size is small. lack of parking but worth the struggle!
1283,Vijay P.,1129,5,8/22/18,best brisket and sauces that i have had in chicago. great attention to making everything the best it can be. huge plus is that it is byob so you can your favorite beer with this bbq so a great bargain for a gourmet meal
1284,Curtis M.,1129,5,10/25/16,awesome bbq joint. got the  brisket   pulled pork sandwich with corn bread. meat was moist and very flavorful and both bbq sauces were very tasty in a complimentary way. want to return!!!!
1285,Francis F.,1129,4,2/2/16,"i went here a couple years ago before my most recent visit here tonight and i have to say that this time around my experience was much better! some notable options are getting the cornbread, pecan bread pudding over the peach cobbler, and bbq beans were ok and avoid the coleslaw! furthermore, i really like the  pulled pork and  brisket sandwiches over the baby back ribs because they were moist, had more flavor and were more tender. the ribs were not fall off the bonesome parts was not as soft as id like it to be and reminds me of dryrubbed ribs i can get elsewhere which might be the reason they lack more flavor because you have to apply either the side of memphis style sauce or carolina style bbq sauces they give ya...happy to have made it here just before pm so there was a short line. it do not know when they started having you order even before they allow you to sit down but i kinda like the line management and the bus boy clearing off tables right away to allow additional seating. service was quick considering the turn out and woman at register was very nice!"
1286,Naomi G.,1129,5,10/30/15," pulled pork .  brisket sandwhich was amazing. came with two types of bbq sauce both delicious. i am usually not a fan of loud atmospheres, but the food was so worth it. plus, you can get food to go."
1287,Anna G.,1129,5,10/28/15,"heaven on earth. definitely worth the wait. three of us got there around  and the line was to the door already. it moved fairly quickly and pretty soon we were waiting for an open table. they really have this process streamlined as best as they can. after you order your food, one of the employees confirms the number of people in your party and as other people leave, they seat you. at that point they start preparing your order. about  minutes after we got our table, our food was ready. everything was so good and you get so much food. between the  of us we had  and  sandwich order  pulled pork ,  chopped brisket. i wanted to try both and this was the best way to do it. if you think ordering half portions means you will get less food, you would be wrong. sliced brisketsuch good flavor smoky and tender. probably liked this version better than the chopped brisket in my sandwich. half chickenthis might as well feed  people because it was so large  slab of st louis ribsyou can get this as an add on so of course we did. again, amazing flavor, so tender. all of our sides came as part of the meals. mac and cheeseit looks like a small portion, but it is so rich you will be glad to not have more because it is tasty so then you would eat more and be even more full. friesyou get a brown paper bag full of them. is this the small version when it comes with the meal? i do not know, but you get way more fries than i expected. cornbreadpretty standard, but good coleslawmore on the vinegary side than mayo, which i appreciated because it is my preference. oh and the sauces. i was a big fan of the thicker memphis style sauce, but the carolina style was good if that is your thing. we pretty much finished everything because we are gluttons and because it was so good it would have been a waste not to. and then they had to roll us out of there. but seriously, i was full until lunch the next day. next time, i would probably not eat the rolls that come with the sandwiches. they are good enough, but they take up valuable space in your stomach. overall, pricing was quite fair, especially when you consider the portions. all of our food plus  fountain drinks and free cup of water came out to just under . we used an a la card so our total bill was even cheaper at . we easily found free street parking. the decor is not anything to write home about, but that is not why you are there."
1288,Joshua C.,1129,5,12/26/14,best bbq i have ever had. park around the corner down the block and just order the pulled pork . i had  pulled pork and  sliced brisket. both were amazing but i wish i had more pulled pork . i also had the peach cobbler which was also amazing and the perfect serving size. pulled pork   brisket   peach cobbler   parking  na service  .
1289,Jennifer N.,1129,5,4/23/14,"best bbq in the city! we waited for about  mins to place our order, then it was just a few minutes till our table was ready, and another  mins for our food to be ready. it was well worth the wait. we got the  brisket  pulled pork sandwich and a half slab of ribs. it was so yummy the meat was nice and tender and i love that they give you the sauce on the side so you can add the bbq sauce as you like. for sides, we got the mac and cheese and peach cobbler and instead of cole slaw we got the corn bread. besides the bbq the next best part of the meal is the peach cobbler. warning it might be hard to find parking around there."
1290,Allison V.,1129,5,7/21/13,went here for lunch with a friend. i had the  and  pulled pork and bbq brisket. yum and yum. i paired it with coleslaw which was very good. i tried my friends baked beans  great fantastic bbq and i cannot wait to go back. outdoor seating.
1291,Jennifer C.,1129,5,7/27/12,"amazing! i have always been skeptical of bbq in chicago, but now smoque has changed all that. i stood in line for about  minutes on a saturday night, but it was well worth the wait. i had the  and  sandwich  brisket,  pulled pork . the coleslaw, baked beans, mac and cheese, and peach cobbler were all equally amazing.  my only complaint is that this place should either be bigger or they should open another location. yum!"
1292,Stan K.,1129,5,7/5/12,"i have never given a restaurant  stars, but this one deserves it. this has to be the best bbq place in chicagonorthwest suburbs. i am a huge fan of bqq and believe that this is as good as it gets close to home anyway. the place is a little small and the line can get farely long but it is well worth the wait. there is not much room to sit inside either and the tables are close together so get ready to sit next to someone you do not know. the ribs are incredible and just put you over the top. when i do not have a lot of time i usually get the  pulled pork  brisket sliced sandwich, coleslaw and fries. also an amazing choice. the pulled pork is tender and has a sweet and sassy bbq sauce. macaroni and cheese is a delicious side as well if that is more to your liking. if you have room left over for desert, definetely try the peach cobbler, taste's like its from georgia if you have ever tried it. absolutel must go!!!"
1293,Justine H.,1129,4,6/18/12,"restaurant smoque bbq cuisine bbq location north center chicago address  n pulaski rd price range ~  poor  ok  good  very good  excellent food  service  ambiance  overall . extra information ranked # restaurant on urbanspoon chicago pay first, and then sit down smoque bbq was a random find for me. nobody told me about it, and i did not find it on urbanspoon or yelp. to be honest, i cannot remember how i stumbled upon their website. anyways, regardless of however i found this spot there was no way i was going to pass up on a bbq place. it was a few minute drive from chicago downtown, so my friend and i decided to check it out. smoque bbq is known for their brisket and bbq ribs but personally, i find briskets to be a little too dry for me. since there were only two of us....i had to think really hard as to what i wanted to order before i visited the restaurant. once i walked in, i was surprised to see the restaurant lay out. i was expecting a full service restaurant, but it was order and pay at front and sit whereever kinda thing. there was a guy from the restaurant guiding everybody and making sure everyone had tables, which was super helpful. keep in mind that they do not let you sit down unless all of your party is present at the restaurant. ordered st louis rib  combo with coleslaw   sides   st louis rib, coleslaw, mac n cheese and fries for .  you can choose between baby back ribs or st. louis  they said st. louis is the meatier and fattier cut so i went with that  if you choose a combo, you get to choose  sides other than a coleslaw  sides are bbq beans, mac n cheese, fries, brisket chili and corn bread  for ., this combo was huge and it could be shared between  people girls  ribs were kind of on the dry side, and the sauce was more so marinated into the meat rather than dripping from it  explains why there was a side of bbq sauce on the side for you to dip in  it was not falloffthebone type which i prefer, it was kind of disappointing  coleslaw was light and refreshing but nothing special  mac n cheese was so good! it was small in portion but had the perfect consistency of cheeseyness and the crust on top was to die for  fries were huge in portion, it was good but again nothing special ordered  pulled pork sandwich   pulled pork sandwich for .  this was better than i thought it would be  most pulled pork sandwiches i find it to be dry  but the pulled pork was so tender and juicy  i did not really like the bun since it was toasted and made it a little messy to eat  they give you some more bbq sauce on the side to use  bbq sauce was tangy with the just right amount of sweetness and smokyness ordered cornbread  side for  cents  this went well with my meal and it was well made  it is made like a corn muffin which made it easier to eat  i could feel the texture of cornmeal when i ate it how it is suppose to be  if you like cornbread, it is def worth  cents! summary i looked around as i was eating my ribs and it seemed like a lot of people were getting the briskets what they are known for. and they looked pretty damn good! it was not dry looking like the most briskets i have seen. i love bbq and meat and i cannot stop thinking about their mac n cheese. price is decent and the turnover rate for tables are quite fast. would recommend to drop by if you are in the area"
1294,Kate M.,1129,4,3/5/12,"before i get into the meat of this review get it? i would like to dedicate it to my very tall friend jim. without his guidance and insistance on making me fat i probably would never have tried smoque. smoque obviously is doing something right,  reviews and . stars makes that pretty clear. the food was good, the service was friendly, and the dining room is nice and clean read not sticky. i had the  &  pulled pork and sliced brisket with cole slaw, fries, and beans. do not worry, i had no intention of eating all of that, but i wanted to try it all. the pulled pork and brisket were both very good, either would make a fantastic sandwich. the cole slaw and fries were also good. something just was not quite right about the beans though, they were too sweet i think. skip the beans, you will not miss  them. it is a counter service place, which works efficiently here. when i got there they were pretty much empty, by the time i was leaving there was a line to the door, so go on off peak times if you do not want to wait. the food was worth it if you are nearby or it is on your way. i do not know that i would go too far out of my way to get some smoque bbq."
1295,Gayle G.,1129,2,6/29/10,"am i the lone dissenter here? we tried to hit smoque on two separate occasions over the past couple of weekends and the line was out the door and down the block. i do not like lines so we did not wait. last week, we had a free afternoon during the week and decided to head to smoque for a late lunch. i did not love it. i had the  and  sandwich platter.  pulled pork and  chopped brisket with beans and slaw. the meat was dry. both of them. either they were cooked to death or they sat in a warming tray for a long time and we got the end of lunch service. the beans were really tasty. the slaw was good, vinegar style, i like it. my friend had the  and  ribs.  st. louis and  baby back. they were okay. i liked that they were not cooked to death and falling off the bone, they still had some structure to them. they were tasty, but i have had way better. he had beans, slaw and mac & cheese. the mac and cheese was ok, but not my fave. overall, the service was really great, the people were nice and it is a typical bbq atmosphere. i love bbq, but being raised in the south, i think i have a pretty high standard. think i will pass on visiting smoque again."
1296,tracy g.,1129,4,5/30/10,"we were looking for a place to pick up food for my husband, the kids and myself. we came upon smoque. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the  brisket,  pulled pork , and the kids had the mac and cheese. the meat was so tender and the sauce that comes with it was so good. my only regret was that i had to eat it fast and could not savor this tasty delight! the kids inhaled the mac and cheese and even my  yr old went to town on the stuff. i could not give  stars because i did not dine in and my husband went in to pick up the food! next time, i am going in!!!"
1297,Gabe L.,1129,4,1/30/10,"just got back from here. that line was out the door and more. i almost hit some people on pulaski. i tried a  pulled pork   brisket   slab of ribs  cornbread  other people's fries. glorious food. the doctors have confirmed that i am currently in a food coma. as my friend said, halfway through the meal, the storm is coming. i feel like cassandra warning of the fall of troy. heed my warning. i shall now heed."
1298,Dennis J.,1129,4,11/30/09,"the worst part about smoque is over quickly finding parking and limited seating. i had the  brisket  pulled pork dinner with cornbread and bbq beans with a peach cobbler to finish. the pulled pork was decent but the brisket was amazing. i feel like i had never eaten brisket before smoque! the beans and cornbread were good, but have i talked about the brisket yet?? the staff is great  we had a larger group and they really worked to accommodate us during their dinner rush."
1299,Steve N.,1129,4,9/2/09,"on my recent trip to chicago, bellamy fat friend brought me here, it was walking distance from where we were staying. i ordered the pulled pork combo with  side dishes. she got the  brisket and  pulled pork and got way more meat than i did! i have never tasted a better mac and cheese in my life. only problem was that the serving was too small. the pulled pork was really good and so was the brisket. this is one of the better bbq places i have been to."
1300,Nycole H.,1129,5,6/26/09,"in love....i am not a huge bbq fan but i do enjoy it on occasion. my friendcoworker and i needed a new place to go for lunch so we decided to head on down irving and see what the fuss was all about. i decided to have a  pulled pork sandwich, fries and peach cobbler...i know..piggy me! i could barely finish the  sandwich  of my fries and the cobbler. the fries are those delicious fresh cut friends yum! the pulled pork was to die for just absolutely yummy!! i like that it was not drowned in bbq, they put sauce on the side to let you choose how much you want. the peach cobbler was average but it was good.  sandwich honestly was plenty! they are very organized even though it gets packed!! the guy came and got us seats and everyone was cleaning tables. it is one of those places where you have to eat and go but it is no big deal! i just read a review about it being byob...really?? i will be back many more times not just because of byob but that is a cool option. first thing i did was run back here to yelp about it."
1301,jeff c.,1129,5,5/6/09,"a group of friends and i yes, with tom t went to try smoque last night. i was not quite sure what to expect...good bbq is one of the few things i miss about living in texas. i ordered the  brisket sliced  pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac and cheese. the meat is a little hard to describe...it was soooooo tender and yet not mushy. super tasty! the mac and cheese was so good also...i am glad the portion was modest, as i probably could have eaten a gallon tub of it, no kidding. the few bites of coleslaw i had i liked, also...very crunchy and not too wet. when i first got there, the line was such that i did not think we would be able to sit down, but somehow a spot to seat all  of us appeared throughout the meal, i noticed nobody was standing waiting to sit down with their food. i do not know how they do that. if only kuma's was the same way.  anyway...i loved this place. it is just my style...great food without being fancy."
1302,Abby B.,1129,5,2/28/09,"i have been here  times since the begining of january when i first heard about smoque on channel . wow. it is the best bbq you can get in chicago. everything here is good. my husband has had every type of meat on the menu except the texas sausage that is being saved for the next trip. his favorite is the chopped brisket. mine is the pulled pork . last time we went for valentine's day he got the best of both worlds  pulled pork and  chopped brisket sandwich. i have to have baked beans when i come here. they have the perfect flavor and are infused with smoke. the macaroni and cheese is so good too. i like to eat a little bit and then wait for it to cool down so the cheese is not runny. it tastes like macaroni and cheese cake! my husband loves the peach cobbler and eats it first because that is when it tastest the best. this place is also byob. and though there is quite a wait at dinner time, many people just open a beer and talk with friends while waiting in line. it is totally worth it. the ownersmanagers are also extremely nice and make sure that you have a place to sit down when it is time to eat. everything is very organized and you know that once you get your food you will not have to wait to eat it. one problem that i have noticed, it seems as though at dinner time the only cashier has to ring up both togo orders and sit down orders. this takes up a lot of time and causes people to wait more than they would have to if they had a separate person ring up only togo orders. it seems to get bussiest around  pm on the weekend nights and around  pm for lunch. busy means that a line has started that goes out of the building. i would try to go before these times to avoid a wait. also, you get quite a bit of food and they put the sides and sandwiches in great easytotakewithyou togo boxes."
1303,paulette b.,1129,5,2/15/09,"yum. there was a line to the door around  on a sunday night they close at . no problem getting a table once we ordered. i had the  pulled pork and  chopped brisket sandwich. they were out of coleslaw, so they gave me my one side really good crunch flavory fries and threw in a peach cobbler for free. the cobbler may have been the best part of the meal  save room. as my friend noted, they use real peaches, not del monte fake ones. the pork was fantastic. i probably will get the sliced brisket not chopped next time, to have a better ratio of smoky beef to charred outer layer though some will surely prefer more char. definitely worth the trip, and it is a short walk from the irving park blue line."
1304,Trevor T.,1129,4,9/25/18,"wow, smoque was jumping on the evening we went. the line was almost out the door on our arrival and went out the door shortly after. for this venture we ordered the sliced brisket , texas sausage, rib combo  baby back,  st. louis, mac and cheese, fresh cut fries, cornbread, and the pecan bread pudding. the rib combo was pretty good with me liking their st. louis ribs just a tiny bit more than their baby backs. typically, i am usually more of a baby back guy. the mac and cheese, fries, and cornbread were okay. the texas sausage was pretty good and had a nice snap to it. the takeaways for me were the sliced brisket and the pecan bread pudding. the brisket was so soft that it barely stayed intact when lifting it with a fork. there was more than enough flavor where adding barbecue sauce was just to see how well it paired. i am no bbq pit master or aficionado, but i really did enjoy the brisket a lot. the pecan bread pudding was a sleeper hit for me and my friend. we only ordered one to try and my friend took a small piece of it saying that was all he wanted. yeah, after eating that small piece he came right back and apologized and said that he is going to have to be taking his half now. i wish i had ordered like six of them."
1305,oscar r.,1129,5,9/3/18,i am not sure if this place needs any more reviews to prove they are the best bbq place in chicago. the sliced brisket is the best i have ever had. the meat is so tender and flavorful that no bbq sauce is needed. the mac and cheese and bread budding are a great combo to this heavenly tasting brisket dish. enjoy!
1306,Robert S.,1129,5,8/16/18,"wow...what great joint. i ordered a half slab of st louis ribs and a side of sliced brisket .  both were excellent.  tender, nicely seasoned, very very good.  the brisket was so tender, it just melted in my mouth.  six pieces of ribs, brisket , fries, mac and cheese and slaw was a lot of food....maybe next time, i can split with a friend and get only  ribs, the brisket and share a side dish. great staff, very clean, very busy."
1307,Mark D.,1129,5,8/10/18,"awesome bbq. i usually go with the sliced brisket sandwich. i also like the chili gumbo. great flavor and very filling. typically we carryout. although they are always busy, the service is usually friendly and fast."
1308,Rebecca X.,1129,4,7/17/18,"solid bbq for the midwest. you order your food first and then one of the smoque employees directs your group to a seating area. the place was busy but the wait was not too bad, maybe  minutes this was  pm on a weeknight. my group of  decided to share a bunch of stuff . lb of sliced brisket , full slab of baby back ribs, large bbq beans, large mac & cheese, large fresh cut fries, and  cornbreads. we chose sliced brisket over chopped for its higher fat content, definitely worth the extra calories. included with the order were  types of sauce memphis style, spicy memphis style, carolina style. the spicy memphis was my favorite  i dipped everything in it! while the four of us were able to finish everything, we were absolutely stuffed. we probably should have gotten one less side and stuck with  lb of brisket . i thought the brisket was the star of the show. it was super tender and juicy and tasted amazing with any of the sauces. ribs were good, nice and smokey. out of all the sides we got, i enjoyed the beans and fries the most. i am not usually a beans type of person, but the smoque version was bursting with flavor. the fries were hot and fresh and tasted great dipped in bbq sauce. cornbread was decent although i could not tell you what constitutes good cornbread i might have been too full to appreciate it. the biggest disappointment was the mac & cheese. the large we got was simply two of their preportioned containers, which are pretty small. honestly it tasted pretty bland and the texture was not creamy or cheesy whatsoever. would skip next time. overall, i would come back here for the meat, though i am not too excited about those sides."
1309,Jin M.,1129,5,6/5/18,"it is good. the sliced brisket is sometimes hit or miss  and by hit i mean the 'best brisket in all of chicago' and by miss i mean 'just good.' when it hits.. it is almost an unreal combination of smokiness, juiciness, flavor, fat, sizzle, drool... some days it can get pretty dry. other than that, the sides are always good  fries, mac & cheese, beans.. did not like the slaw at first but it is grown on me  the vinegar cuts through the heavy meat and sides for a refreshing break. one thing that is  consistent is their service  always friendly and helpful. for the volume they get they manage to keep the lines moving quickly. outside seating is great as well."
1310,Jennifer L.,1129,4,5/24/18,"tasty bbq with awesome sauces. ordered the sliced brisket and pulled pork platter, added sausage and st louis ribs, with side of brisket chili and mac n cheese. sliced brisket was very lean and a bit dry but everything else was great. favorite was the pulled pork, which was surprisingly tender. my favorite sauce was the spicy memphis. also really enjoyed the chili. portion was small."
1311,Mary F.,1129,5,5/9/18,"this restaurant has been on my list for quite a while! i also heard about it on the tv show and told a friend about it. they really recommended this place and i went along with my sister. something i would suggest from the beginning would be to order ahead of time and then just eat outside. the wait was quite a bit to order and then go get out food. it is a decent sized place. but there is alwayyysss a line. from the moment we got there to the time we left there was still a line out the door. i ended up getting the st. louis half rack with corn bread and mac and cheese as sides, which were anazinngggggg. you could really taste the smokiness of the ribs. i also had the peach cobbler which is a must try! my sister ended up getting the sliced brisket which was incredibly tender and juicy. if i were to do it again i would get the brisket !"
1312,Jason C.,1129,5,5/6/18,get the sliced brisket by the pound. it is a ton of meat and the value is great. came here on a sunday afternoon at pm and luckily there was no line. grabbed some sliced brisket and a few sides. i had everything on their menu and everything is delicious. make sure to get the peach cobbler!
1313,Marissa B.,1129,5,4/29/18,"when i crave bbq, all i want is smoque. the sliced brisket is the best i have ever had, and you cannot go wrong with the mac & cheese, cornbread, cole slaw and fries. it is a casual place where the line goes pretty fast we waited about  minutes on a saturday night for  people. your whole party has to be there before getting seated."
1314,Mikala D.,1129,4,2/13/18,"get the sliced brisket . it is so tender, perfectly seasoned and moist. i even eat the fat on it which i cut off of all other meat. shhh do not tell anyone. mac and cheese is good, so are desserts. i am not a fan of ribs that do not fall off the bone like most chicagoans so i do not care for them. still have not had good restaurant ribs outside of the south to date and i have had most of the hyped rib joint ribs near and far in the chicago area. the smoked chicken is just ok, i have had it a few times but the real winner here is the smoked brisket . wait times are long and the communal seating is just not my thing. it feels like an old timey western saloon in there. order takeout, but be warned the parking is strugglebus."
1315,Amy D.,1129,4,1/5/18,"smoque bbq was highly rated on yelp and a byob so it had to be a winwin. only half of our party had arrived, so they would not let us order. if we did, they could not guarantee seating for our whole party. i understand that there is limited seating and it is a popular place, but this rule was a pain in the butt. when the rest of our party did arrive, we ordered and waited a while to be seated because the rush that walked in earlier was happily eating. luckily, they did not prepare our orders until we had a table. finally we were able to dig in! all of our platters were served with coleslaw and two choices of sides. between all of us, we had pulled pork, three orders of sliced brisket , and one order of chopped brisket . each platter was served with memphis and carolina style barbeque sauce. most of the meat is lean here. the pulled pork was delicious. i really enjoyed the crispy pieces. the chopped and sliced brisket were also very good. two of our orders of sliced brisket were lean and one was not, so the brisket is not totally consistent. in all, the meat was tender and had a nice smoke flavor. the only thing i did not care for was the texas sausage. it was not memorable it tasted like a regular sausage. now, for the special part of the meal the sides! sides ranked . beans . coleslaw . gumbo . chili . mac . fries . cornbread the beans took the gold. they had an addicting smoke flavor and just enough sweetness to make you want to ditch the spoon and drink it out of the container. okay, maybe that is just me. but seriously, smoque bbq should can the sauce from the bbq beans. i found it even better than the memphis style and carolina style sauces. a very close second was the coleslaw. thank god they include it on everyone's plate because we all devoured it. not a single shred was leftover! the coleslaw was crisp, light and refreshing. i love that they did not weigh it down with a ton of mayo. the gumbo was in third. it may not technically be a side, but it is the same size, so we will allow it. the spice level was where a gumbo needed to be. i could not find anything wrong with it. chili was next. it was heavy on the chili powder, but i enjoyed the kick. mac and cheese took fifth place. smoque keeps their mac classic creamy and topped with breadcrumbs. i was thankful for the small portion, so i could enjoy the other sides as well. second to last, the fries. just plain ol' fries here folks. nothing to it. and in last place, cornbread. sorry cornbread lovers, but i found it as dry as a day old biscuit. smoque bbq is a great place for barbeque in chicago. heck, i even like it more than some bbq places in texas. bring your friends, arrive all together, drink some beers, and get that food in your belly! do not forget to order the bbq beans. oh, and if you have room, the bread pudding is full of cinnamon. it is delicious and i normally hate bread pudding."
1316,Sean S.,1129,4,12/23/17,"a couple coworkers talked about this place, so i finally had lunch there. i ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and peach cobbler for dessert. then stood by the door and waited for a table because all the seats were taken. a host sat me a few minutes later when a table became available. a few minutes later my name was called, i went to the counter and retrieved my meal on a tray. two small containers had bbq one was memphis style and one was north carolina style, i think. i liked them both. brisket was great. mac and cheese was good but awfully small portion. peach cobbler was good i do not recall having peach cobbler before, so i was not sure what to expect. it was also a very small portion. brisket sandwich with a side  coleslaw, peach cobbler dessert and a fountain soda was about . staff was friendly and quick. it is near the blue line. i am planning on going back"
1317,Cassidy H.,1129,3,12/4/17,"of course like everyone else says, the bbq is to die for! i always get the sliced brisket , mac and cheese, corn bread and of course the bread pudding i am obsessed with! i atually worked there for a short amount of time and ended up quitting because to be honest some of the employees there are foul human beings. they do tip pool there and is split between the restaurant and the beginning of each month. they ended up taking mine away because i had the flu and still tried to work because i had no one to cover my shift and i did not want to leave them short handed. they ended up sending me home after  hours of work because they said i looked too ill and out of it. well come two days later i am approached by the manager and told that i do not deserve my tips for the month because i could not perform the proper customer service skill that day because i looked too sick...it is funny because la ville restaurant down the street even told me they are known for screwing people out of there tips. so needless to say i will always love the food but it is sad i have to go there and get food when i know when i am dealing ignorant employees that are making the food.."
1318,Suhan K.,1129,5,10/1/17,"fall off the bone, perfectly charred st. louis riiiiibs, woooooooo!! i just had the best slab of ribs here at chicago's own smoque bbq. until now my local hometown buzz and neds reigned supreme...but this rich, juicy, tender, smokey charred meat marshmallows in my mouth goodness the brisket here is amazing too, i would recommend the sliced brisket and the st. louis ribs over the baby back ribs. located  miles out the city, even though it was poppin inside, the wait was not too horrible. there were  of us and we were seated in about  mins and got our food in  mins on a busy saturday night at around  pm, so i can only imagine what this place looked at around prime time pm. the staff here is awesome, very courteous and helpful, this is not a sit down restaurant but there was one guy who would go around asking how many in each party and reserving tables when people got up to accommodate each group which i thought was cool. the price is not bad, my full rack with  sides and cole slaw was .. there brisket chili is and i just added fries with that which were good. the cole slaw was really goood too. i saw a lot of ppl getting the beans and mac and cheese but the mac and cheese did not look worth it as it looked like an ice cream scoop worth of mac and cheese compared to the amount of fries they gave you, in too much of a fatty and wanted more for what i felt i was paying for. brisket chili was a generous portion too smoque bbq is rockin out some midwest goodness, cannot wait to head to texas and kc one day because i love bbq frank underwood tap tap"
1319,Ray H.,1129,5,9/22/17,great place for bbq the sliced brisket was great as well the baked beans the mac and cheese and the coleslaw the chicken was top notch also cannot say enough about the bbq at a great price
1320,Matthew L.,1129,5,6/26/17,"two things to preface  i love bbq and, as a result, have a pretty low threshold for a star review  my favorite bbq in chicago and that of many other yelpers is green street smoked meats, so i am going to potentially unfairly write this review in this context. overall, green street has better sides and a better nonfood experience smoque has better meat and better price points. but both are amazing and you cannot go wrong with either. atmosphereservice whereas green street presents itself as the trendier location barnwarehouse decor, west loop locale, etc., smoque is more of a neighborhood joint. it is in a more residential area, with plenty of parking on side streets there is even a small parking lot, suburban style!. the interior is pretty barebones, like countless bbq joints in the south. it is more authentic, but, at the same time, i am a bit of a sucker for the warehouse vibe, and it is a little more unique. both places can have long lines for food, but smoque has more limited seating and kind of botched our order at first. edge green street. sides green street's beans are the best. smoque's are smokier, but less complex and tangy, and maybe a little watery. still good. smoque's cornbread is tasty but small. their coleslaw is vinegary a plus and full of raw onion which i found to be not great. their mac n cheese is tasty, but i am not a mac n cheese guy with bbq. green street's sides are more varied and bigger. but neither place has collards! where are the collard greens, guys?! edge green street. meat i have really only had sliced brisket at both places. green street's, while very tasty, is not as good as smoque's. why? the fat. smoque's brisket at least the slices i got was laced with amazing, meltinyourmouth smoked fat. if i could, i would order their fat trimmings and spread it on a cracker or eat it with a spoon. do not go to smoque if you think that saturated fat is really bad for you.  smoque is cheaper. also, it is byob but only indoors. i would say go to green street if you are not so much into bbq as you are into the sides andor your main purpose is for the social aspect of eating out. go to smoque if you are serious about your smoked meat product."
1321,Nicollette W.,1129,4,6/23/17,"get the pecan bread pudding! i am not usually a bread pudding type, but this specialty item not always on the menu was delish! and of course their bbq was amazing as many have stated. shared some sliced brisket and hot links with my man last night for dindin."
1322,Marie F.,1129,5,6/20/17,"this place has the best barbecue i have ever had. i love barbecue and i take the drive from wisconsin at least once a month to come here. it is worth the horrendous traffic. they recently added a seating area outside to double their seating, and they will still be full all the time. i love the sliced brisket , the sausage, the bread pudding. my husband loves the brisket and the pork, the peach cobbler and the beans. you can not go wrong here. everything is amazing!"
1323,Johnny G.,1129,5,9/30/13,"amazing!!!!!!!!! i have never had bbq like this in my life. we were recommended this place by a friend of ours who travels the country in search of great bbq. he said it was the best in chicago. he was right. this place is nothing fancy. it is on the corner of a busy intersection and is a typical chicago style diner. there is indoor and outdoor seating and the busboys help you find a table. we went on a saturday at  p.m. and had no trouble getting a seat. i ordered the sliced brisket with sides of cole salad, peach cobbler and cornbread. the cobbler and corn bread are baked in these little tins and are absolutely divine. the meat literally melts in your mouth. i got all of this food which i could not finish for .. this place is worth the trip for bbq loversabsolutely fantastic!"
1324,Adrian R.,1129,5,10/12/18,"really great bbq joint, makes you almost forget you are in chicago. tried a full run of their offerings from pulled pork , to brisket, to ribs, to chicken. and ordered straight down the line for sides. everything was considered, differentiated in flavor, and on point. will be back very soon. also the owner is a real sweetheart."
1325,Urock M.,1129,4,8/16/18,food. is so good my job ordered for a pot luck brisket was tender pulled pork was delicious and the sauce was good.
1326,Tina V. W.,1129,4,8/3/18,"if one is a customer who has never smoked meat, this restaurant is a solid stars. if you are someone who has smoked meat, this restaurant is a  to   star restaurant a bbq smoker aficionado will be able to smoke better food...but, then, it is a pain in the boongie to pack a  lb smoker in your checkedin luggage.  the restaurant is clean. the service is polite and quick. this is what i had for  meals pickled jalepenos scrumptious!! the heat of the jalepenos was nicely balanced by the slight sweetness. strange, but great flavor combination. beans decent. warning taste these before eating the brisket chile. once you eat the brisket chile, you do not want to stop. yes, the brisket chile is to die for. oh...the beans...yes the beans are good. but, psssssttttt...the brisket chile is better!! brisket chile you will thank the bbq gods for this side dish. coleslaw refreshing, yummy, delicioso, delizioso, dlicieux, kstlich, , oishƒ..you get the picture. this is a fantastic vinegary, nomayo coleslaw. made of cabbage & radish. pulled pork  delicious and moist. unlike most bbq places, they actually serve you pork with the smoke ring. most bbq places we have been to most of them highlyrated in yelp, do not serve you any meat with the smoke ring. the smoke ring is a sign that the meat has been smoked properly. also, most bbq places do not inject their pulled pork . so, if the bbq restaurant is not smoking the pulled pork for  hours, do not add additional rub to the pulled pork , andor do not inject their pulled pork with marinade, you will end up with bland pork . my husband & i have just smoked pork during july th...we will eventually become bbq smoking ninjas.  cornbread basic. sigh brisket boring. it was a bit dry. according to their website, the deep, rich smoke flavor is complemented by a layer spice rub. sorry, but, there was absolutely no spice rub or smoke flavor in the  lb to  lb of brisket that i had. luckily, i was able to use the carolina and spicy memphis bbq sauces to flavor the brisket. great pulled pork and surprisingly wonderful side dishes. there is something for everyone at this restaurant."
1327,Vince B.,1129,5,8/3/18,"wow probably one of the best bbqs i have had. came all the way from the loop by the l just to experience that well recommended place. not disappointed at all. tried thee of their meats  pulled pork , baby back ribs and brisket. each one better than the other!! portions of fries are generous. mac & cheese's much less. staff is cool and ready to attend you. service is quick despite loads of people turning up to eat in or to go. will be back."
1328,Karlos S.,1129,4,7/30/18,great bbq brisket and pulled pork . line can be a bit extensive so get there earlier to devote some time to waiting.
1329,Lisa P.,1129,5,7/30/18,one of the the best bbq places in chicago! you order at the counter and then have the option of indoor or outdoor seating weather permitting. i usually get a platter with  sides. i have tried almost all the meat options and the brisket and pulled pork are out of this world. all the sides are good but i really love the mac n cheese and the cornbread. you can also get a sandwich or platter with slaw which is also amazing. the place is usually packed and nothing fancy but if you are looking for some delicious meat smoque is the place to go. there are a few options for sauce and you really cannot go wrong!
1330,Betty P.,1129,5,7/25/18,"if you have not tried smoque bbq you are definitely missing out! i honestly believe there is no one better doing bbq in the chi! my usual go to is the full slab meat falls right off the bone with one bite with mac and cheese and fries! ? i have also tried their pulled pork in the past and it is juicy and tender. their cole slaw is not your traditional slaw, it is more of a vinegary slaw which gives the bbq sauce a nice contrast! i love it! portions are pretty large and filling. expect to a. wait in a long line and b pay your traditional bbq joint prices example meal for two will cost you ish? but totally worth it! my mouth watered writing this review and i cannot wait to go back! also this is probably not the best place to go for a first date unless you can care less about stuffing your face and getting messy or maybe it is totally the best place to go on a first date and if they call you after, they are worth keeping around!"
1331,Kelly T.,1129,5,6/21/18,"i recently used smoque to cater a family party in fathers day. i was absolutely impressed. i have used various catering services often for both work and family and my experience with smoque was one of the easiest and best. i called to make the order and the head of catering was very friendly and efficient. my pick up time was available and she included plates, napkins, and serving supplies. on pick up day, catering orders do not need to wait in the long regular line, you just go to the front and tell them you have catering, which i appreciated. there was a two minute wait and i was offered a free drink! nice!! then, a lady brought out boxes , double checked everything was there thank you!! and even loaded boxes into my car. everyone loved the brisket, pulled pork , beans, and mac. the salad was pretty bland and boring so i would skip that next time. everything else was amazing and well priced. we will def use again."
1332,Stefan F.,1129,5,6/20/18,definitely the best all around bbq in chicago. all bbq items are nicely smoked and served with sauce on the side as i like it. the brisket and pulled pork are both very good. the real stars are the st. louis ribs which are excellent. additionally the sides are great and i think they have the best vinegar slaw around. the only drawback is that they can get pretty crowded.
1333,Daisee D.,1129,4,6/14/18,"there is usually a long line at this place, but we got lucky and the wait time was not any longer than  minutes to get our food and seated. i know this is a barbecue joint, but my favorite thing on their menu is not their ribs, or their briskets, or the pulled pork ,  it is their macaroni and cheese! they are so good, they were my two sides with the order. the ribs were good, just a bit on the dry side for me. briskets were good also. i did not like the sauces that came with the ribs, so i used tabasco sauce instead. they are a bit on the pricey side. i had the brisket platter, comes with coleslaw and  sides. i also added  of a slab. total was . i am not much of a ribs person, so i will be back next year, or when i am craving mac and cheese."
1334,Jonathan S.,1129,5,5/8/18,"i am a fella that is big on bbq, and smoque does not disappoint. i mean, with this many reviews, i know they do not need mine, but had to drop a quick line because it is so darn good. i try to stop in on the weekdays for lunch, it is not as busy as it is on the weekends, but regardless the line goes quickly. if you like pulled pork , it is a must try. it melts in your mouth tender, and the flavor is amazing. you get a couple different bbq sauces, i enjoy both very much. the carolina style goes great poured on the pork and i actually like dipping my sandwich and fries in the memphis cannot get enough bbq i love the brisket as well, but i prefer the pork . as far as sides, the mac and cheese and coleslaw are the way to go. although you cannot go wrong with the beans either."
1335,Bodhi D.,1129,4,5/6/18,this was my first time eating at smoque and it was a good experience. i got the pulled pork sandwich. the meat was absolutely meltinyourmouth tender. will definitely come back!
1336,L L.,1129,4,4/26/18,very good bbq. i had the texas sausage and my beau had the pulled pork . comes with two bbq sauce options and two sides when ordering the plate. easy to order and the kind gentlemen is watching out for the open table to direct you to. do not plan on having any in depth conversations as the tables are pretty tight together and the noise can get quite loud. there is a patio area that i'm sure will be packed in the summer time. cannot wait to come back.
1337,Cassie N.,1129,5,4/20/18,"this place was awesome. i love bbq and trying new places, smoque bbq did not disappoint. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and mac and cheese. they serve the sandwich with two different sides of bbq sauce both delicious. the mac and cheese was hands down the best i have ever had at any restaurant. staff was attentive and friendly. and to top it off, the place is byob"
1338,Stacy D.,1129,5,4/9/18,"seems like whenever i have visitors from out of town we always end up going to smoque... and for a good reason! the food here is awesome! for a party of  we shared a full slab of baby back ribs, half a chicken, pulled pork , cole slaw, fries, beans, and chili. nothing else to say than everything was great and highly recommend you come and try everything, cannot go wrong with anything on the menu."
1339,Julie T.,1129,5,10/24/18,very good bbq the chopped brisket is delicious and their coleslaw is so good not the mayo kind!
1340,Debbie L.,1129,2,8/8/18,"we tried this restaurant for the first time and while the st louis ribs were meaty and delicious, the baby backs were dry and unappealing. we also had the chopped brisket and mac n cheesedry with little favor. the brisket chili was very tasty. not our favorite triple d place at all."
1341,Refael Hai S.,1129,5,7/22/18,"i have been traveling all over the country and i had bbq in different places. this bbq restaurant is by far on my top  list. from the second you walk in the amazing smell make you fill like you are in bbq heaven! i had chopped brisket , texas sausage , brisket chili & the pudding .... i have one word , wow. everything is so fresh and yummy , the flavors explode in your mouth and you can stop eat even tho you are already full. the only thing i wish they have , tasting sampler. defiantly a place to go back again & again."
1342,Keli W.,1129,5,7/9/18,"best food of my life!!! i cannot eat bbq anywhere else. great staff, simple menu, superb food.  the chopped brisket is what is up!!!!!!"
1343,Joseph Carlo V.,1129,5,7/8/18,"i have been told about this place & how it is one of the best bbq in the city. therefore, this place had some high expectations from me.. & it they were met and exceeded! located a block down and right past the interstate on pulaski and irving park, smoque is in its own tiny hot spot. i came here for dinner on a weekday night right before the line grew outside the doors. the menu is small, which is ideal for an indecisive person like me...but has all the essential american bbq options like ribs baby back & st. louis style, brisket , chicken, pull pork, and sausage. also, most entrees include a couple sides with the meal and coleslaw. sides are fries, brisket chili, mac and cheese, cornbread, and beans. i had the chopped brisket with slaw, mac&cheese, and cornbread. man oh man, the mac&cheese was a small serving but soft, fluffy, and delicious! the cornbread is equivalent to the child of famous dave's cornbread if you know, they have the best cornbread ever with corn inside. lastly, my food came with a caroline bbq sauce & and memphis style bbq sauce that i would interchangeably switch back and forth on my brisket . oooo baby, it was a good, quick bite that came out pretty quick! mark my word, i will be back to get some of those good good ribs i saw others had. "
1344,Will M.,1129,3,7/3/18,"i had such high hopes. it was not for me. i had the chopped brisket sandwich. i found it dry....and tasty. but not as tasty as i have had elsewhere. maybe i am not the connoisseur that everyone else is. my tummy was not right afterwards either. oh...also parking is a bitch, over there."
1345,Laura T.,1129,4,6/6/18,i have to say  it is hard to find good bbq in chicago. it is not like kansas city where there is a great bbq joint on every corner  here you really have to pound the pavement to find places that deserve to be called real bbq & smoque is definitely on my list. went there on mother's day  at pm  and there was a line out the door! everything is good but my favorite is the chopped brisket . yum. go. eat. lick ya fingers!
1346,Mark Y.,1129,5,6/2/18,"love the chopped brisket , bread pudding, and salad ?!. actually my favorite salad in the city. get it with the chicken."
1347,George B.,1129,4,5/6/18,"freakin' good!!! in search for some good bbq while visiting chicago my wife and i decided to head a little north of the city and tried out smoque. trust me it was worth the trip! by far one of the best bbq spots i have been to in a while. i think it is safe to say waaaaay better than mighty quinn's nyc. there was just something about the st. louis ribs that made you want another bite while you were chewing on your previous bite. the smokiness, the meat falling free off the bone, pure bliss. for  people, my wife and i destroyed a full order of ribs, chopped brisket , beans and mac n' cheese. i cannot rave too much over the brisket , but honestly i never do where ever i go. but those ribs is a must. another must if you have room for it is the delicious pecan bread pudding. you will be missing out on a taste of heaven if you do not try it."
1348,Val A.,1129,4,3/19/18,"this is good bbq. the portions are big and the service was friendly. the sauces were ok, nothing special. i wish they had an alabama white sauce. i got the chopped brisket which i am a huge fan of chopped instead of sliced, so kudos to smoque for offering that. i am taking off a star because due to their popularity the line was long and the wait was at least  minutes just to put in my order and then it was another  minutes for my order to be ready. i think it would be best to put in an order ahead of time by phone and then pick it up."
1349,Jinu J.,1129,5,2/20/18,came here on valentine's day. the food was delicious. i especially loved the chopped brisket and the mac and cheese. the meat was the tender and the sauce went very well. the mac and cheese now was like cheese heaven. it was a perfect meal. also the service was great. there were ppl helping to seat us and it was busy day with not much wait time and more than affordable prices.
1350,Lydia M.,1129,4,2/2/18,"awesome brisket , if you go early and it is slow ask for the burnt ends, incredible! get chopped brisket if taking to go and sliced if eating in. pulled pork is very good, as are all the sides i have tried.mac, fries, beans, cornbread"
1351,Burim S.,1129,4,1/20/18,"i heard ton of friends raving about smoque. i had to try it for myself. i knew this could be special once i seen the meat served with no bbq sauce. st.luis ribs where awesome, so was the chopped brisket . the baked beans and coleslaw where not nothing to write home about. i was however satisfied, as i went there for the meat and the meat was  ."
1352,Nicole H.,1129,5,1/4/18,"this place is amazing. best bbq around, i am upset i had not tried it sooner. we got the pulled pork and chopped brisket both with mac n cheese on the side. it was sooo good. i have tried tons of fatty brisket , but this was cooked to perfection. the baked mac and cheese also blew my mind. we will be back here very soon!"
1353,Cj M.,1129,1,12/10/17,"these guys have just lost touch with reality, food is fine but an increase in their chopped brisket from . to . is evidence that their intent on gouging the foodie klans that roam chicago. this place used to be nice departure from conventional cuisine but they are clearly intent on exploiting their niche in their culinary space. it is an easy decision for me, just say no, there is no justification for such drastic price increases that grossly outpace the rate of inflation, and i can assure none their employees saw a cent of this additional increase. nice try, maybe the folks that come in from the suburbs will pay this ridiculous price but for those of us who live in the neighborhood understand what is going over there. simple just do not go there any longer until they start to become reasonable."
1354,John H.,1129,5,9/9/17,"bbq in chicago is generally disappointing, so this place stands out as one of the top spots for me. it is nothing compared to texas or kansas city, but in my eyes it is pretty damn good. the brisket at smoque is really something to write home about. so rich and smokey and unbelievably tasty. the chicken is good too, really recommended if you like smoked chicken. i had to give the ribs a few tries before i warmed up to them, but i think they are great. the meat definitely does not fall off the bone, you are going to be using your jaw a little which is not necessarily a bad thing, just depends on your preference but the ribs are charred in that special way that brings out every ounce of flavor in the meat. my recommendation chopped brisket sandwich with a side of fries and mac n cheese, cornbread instead of coleslaw, and a rib addon, which is just a few bucks extra. you will get plenty of food and a great showcase of some of the best bbq in this terrible city."
1355,Scott R.,1129,4,6/13/17,you know how some places are hit or miss. this place is like home run or double. the food is either very good or amazing! i went on a saturday a few months ago and the bbq was good. but i went for lunch the other day with a work associate from out of town and the food was on point! i always get the chopped brisket and it did not disappoint. i highly recommend if you are looking for a good bbq joint.
1356,Tanner C.,1129,4,6/12/17,"lineup to get in the door built some anticipation, did not really like the menu structure but the food was really good. as usual with a bbq place, ordered too much and paid for it the next day. had the brisket platter with the taste of pulled pork, ribs, and sausage  decided to have the  and  sliced & chopped brisket , would def recommend. it ended up being really, really tasty but it was too much food. great service, the staff was really awesome and super helpful. above all, would definitely recommend the bread pudding for dessert  so good. had the menu ordering structure been more friendly, would have given a five star"
1357,Trevor T.,1129,4,9/25/18,"wow, smoque was jumping on the evening we went. the line was almost out the door on our arrival and went out the door shortly after. for this venture we ordered the sliced brisket, texas sausage , rib combo  baby back,  st. louis, mac and cheese, fresh cut fries, cornbread, and the pecan bread pudding. the rib combo was pretty good with me liking their st. louis ribs just a tiny bit more than their baby backs. typically, i am usually more of a baby back guy. the mac and cheese, fries, and cornbread were okay. the texas sausage was pretty good and had a nice snap to it. the takeaways for me were the sliced brisket and the pecan bread pudding. the brisket was so soft that it barely stayed intact when lifting it with a fork. there was more than enough flavor where adding barbecue sauce was just to see how well it paired. i am no bbq pit master or aficionado, but i really did enjoy the brisket a lot. the pecan bread pudding was a sleeper hit for me and my friend. we only ordered one to try and my friend took a small piece of it saying that was all he wanted. yeah, after eating that small piece he came right back and apologized and said that he is going to have to be taking his half now. i wish i had ordered like six of them."
1358,Charles G.,1129,5,8/17/18,"all week i have been craving bbq and today i finally satisfied those cravings. sometimes you have to travel for good food and let me tell you it was totally worth the trip.  minutes drive in chicago traffic to dine get to go food at smoque bbq. today i had the pleasure of killing an order of baby back ribs, texas sausage and the best brisket in the city with memphis style bbq sauce which is needed, food so good that you do not need sauce i encourage everyone that if you want some really good bbq try smoque bbq. if you cannot make it to the full service restaurant they have a scaled down version at the revival food hall"
1359,Steve P.,1129,4,5/18/18,"we live about   hours away and made the drive to chicago on mothers day just go give this place a shot. our son and his fiance live in chicago so it was a win win for mom. we visit kelleys island in lake erie a lot. last year we saw an ad for smoque on a place mat at one of the island restaurants and knew we just had to try it! this place did not disappoint at all. having lived in texas for  years, we know good bbq and this place has it...hands down. the meats were all amazing with the perfect amount of smoke. the texas sausage was deelish and the brisket was out of this world. so good. the only thing we did not care for was the mac and cheese. while we wanted to, we just could not love it as it was a bit dry and seemed to have been in the warmer for a while. will surely try it next time as it was probably a fluke. however, those darn french fries looked amazing so we will try those on the next trip. overall, we loved this place and cannot wait to go back again."
1360,L L.,1129,4,4/26/18,very good bbq. i had the texas sausage and my beau had the pulled pork. comes with two bbq sauce options and two sides when ordering the plate. easy to order and the kind gentlemen is watching out for the open table to direct you to. do not plan on having any in depth conversations as the tables are pretty tight together and the noise can get quite loud. there is a patio area that i'm sure will be packed in the summer time. cannot wait to come back.
1361,Bill C.,1129,3,2/21/18,did not live up to the hype. average at best. brisket was very dry. bbq beans were okay. mac and cheese was good. texas sausage was very good. peach cobbler had a bitter taste. cole slaw was really bad. basically cabbage with vinegar. there is better bbq in chicago.
1362,Robert R.,1129,3,1/17/18,"the food was ok. it was not great, it was not horrible. it was just ok. the texas sausage was bland and flavorless. the fries, slaw, and beans were pretty good."
1363,Amy D.,1129,4,1/5/18,"smoque bbq was highly rated on yelp and a byob so it had to be a winwin. only half of our party had arrived, so they would not let us order. if we did, they could not guarantee seating for our whole party. i understand that there is limited seating and it is a popular place, but this rule was a pain in the butt. when the rest of our party did arrive, we ordered and waited a while to be seated because the rush that walked in earlier was happily eating. luckily, they did not prepare our orders until we had a table. finally we were able to dig in! all of our platters were served with coleslaw and two choices of sides. between all of us, we had pulled pork, three orders of sliced brisket, and one order of chopped brisket. each platter was served with memphis and carolina style barbeque sauce. most of the meat is lean here. the pulled pork was delicious. i really enjoyed the crispy pieces. the chopped and sliced brisket were also very good. two of our orders of sliced brisket were lean and one was not, so the brisket is not totally consistent. in all, the meat was tender and had a nice smoke flavor. the only thing i did not care for was the texas sausage . it was not memorable it tasted like a regular sausage . now, for the special part of the meal the sides! sides ranked . beans . coleslaw . gumbo . chili . mac . fries . cornbread the beans took the gold. they had an addicting smoke flavor and just enough sweetness to make you want to ditch the spoon and drink it out of the container. okay, maybe that is just me. but seriously, smoque bbq should can the sauce from the bbq beans. i found it even better than the memphis style and carolina style sauces. a very close second was the coleslaw. thank god they include it on everyone's plate because we all devoured it. not a single shred was leftover! the coleslaw was crisp, light and refreshing. i love that they did not weigh it down with a ton of mayo. the gumbo was in third. it may not technically be a side, but it is the same size, so we will allow it. the spice level was where a gumbo needed to be. i could not find anything wrong with it. chili was next. it was heavy on the chili powder, but i enjoyed the kick. mac and cheese took fifth place. smoque keeps their mac classic creamy and topped with breadcrumbs. i was thankful for the small portion, so i could enjoy the other sides as well. second to last, the fries. just plain ol' fries here folks. nothing to it. and in last place, cornbread. sorry cornbread lovers, but i found it as dry as a day old biscuit. smoque bbq is a great place for barbeque in chicago. heck, i even like it more than some bbq places in texas . bring your friends, arrive all together, drink some beers, and get that food in your belly! do not forget to order the bbq beans. oh, and if you have room, the bread pudding is full of cinnamon. it is delicious and i normally hate bread pudding."
1364,Foodie J.,1129,3,11/1/17,"cole slaw  stars it was by far the best thing on the plate. sent my palate straight to heaven. they need to jar it and sell it at grocery stores... bbq sauce  stars very runny. not thick at all. quite a thin texture. have to soak components in sauce when dipping in order for sauce to stick on food before it makes the short trip from dipping sauce cup to lips. perhaps it would be best if they served the sauce on the food, instead of in small cups. that way, the experience with utilizing the sauce would be much more convenient. ribs  stars tasted like carpet. point, blank, period. old carpet, not new fresh carpet. almost killed my apetite, and my palate. bbq beans  stars overwhelming taste of bbq. but i guess that is what i should expect considering that they are bbq beans, had bbq beans in the past from other places did not quite like them then either. so, im assuming it is just me and these were cooked perfectly. im just not a fan... texas sausage  stars satisfying, not memorable. nothing to write home about... brisket  stars some of the best brisket i ever had. nd best thing on the plate, after cole slaw. would come back just for the brisket, it was quite tender, yet delightfully melted on the palate. simply amazing..."
1365,Eric P.,1129,5,5/28/17,"some of the best brisket in the city. if you are showing up on a clear day, be prepared for a long wait in the line but it is well worth it. great helpful staff and great service rounds out a great bbq eating experience. recommendations  sliced brisket  texas sausage  ribs [i am a st. louis ribs man but the baby back is good too]  mac n cheese  bbq beans  for a limited time, the bbq gumbo  handiwipes"
1366,Ryan P.,1129,4,12/18/16,"bbq, more than any other food of which i am aware, is subjective. where you come from has almost as much to do with any opinion as meat and seasoning. that said i am somewhat of a snob. disclaimer done, the is a solid meal. i order a  &  platter with brisket and sausage . the star was the sausage , while not a traditional chicago hot link, it is well above the grilled eckrich sausage many of their peers serve. for a real hot link see hecky's or uncle j's it is not fine ground. in fairness, they call it texas sausage and not a hot link. brisket was bland to me, maybe an off day, but it failed the i can eat this without sauce test. see green street. i know that that test is controversial but it works for me. i would eat here again as the staff was friendly and the meal came at a very reasonable price considering what some of the peers charge for the same. i really liked the music and all in all it is pretty chill. did i mention i really like the music?"
1367,Carlos A.,1129,4,10/17/16,"my girlfriend and i shared  lb. of sliced brisket,  rack of st. louis ribs, the texas sausage , fries, mac & cheese and cole slaw. all of the meats had great flavor. the mac & cheese was great, as well. the fries were fine. the cole slaw was pretty mediocre but it is just cole slaw so it does not really matter. staff was friendly. came out to about  for all the food and  drinks which is about par for the course when it comes to quality bbq. they do not serve alcohol, by the way. would definitely come back next time i am in chicago."
1368,Chiquita E.,1129,1,7/17/16,"i really wanted to give this place  stars. i purchased a slab of ribs, sliced brisket and the texas sausages . i also got sides bbq gumbo, mac and cheese and brisket chilli. the sides and the texas sausages were great. the ribs and the sliced brisket were unseasoned. i was extremely disappointed. the bbq sauces are very good that is the only saving grace for the unseasoned ribs and unseasoned brisket. i understand this place is very busy but, unseasoned meat is totally unacceptable."
1369,Desmond F.,1129,4,2/12/16,"chicago is not a place particularly known for bbq but with a record like the one it has on yelp it was a must try. i have high expectations for bbq joints. no, i am not from the south and will not harp on authentic this or non authentic that. i just love meat and bbq so much that i would go broke going out to eat it all the time. so instead i make the time to make it myself hours at a time in my own smoker. i know how much care and time it takes to do this. it cannot be rushed, and mistakes covered with sauce will be wet messy mistakes indeed. so yeah, smoque fits the bill. i ordered the brisket with two sides mac and cheese, and fries and it came with coleslaw. what is nice is that they allow you to add tastes of the other meats. perfect for someone like me who just has to try everything. texas sausage ? yes. some of the ribs? thank you very much. i can confirm that the meat is done right. they provide sauce on the side and serve the meat dry. it allows me to add sauce to my own taste and judge the meat by its own merit. which, was very good. right consistency, which is to say fragile and about to break down from its time in the smoker. perhaps a tad dry but i understand they have to do it ahead for the volume expected of a restaurant. the sauces also were not overly sugary brown concoctions either. had some variety and some kick if you wanted as well. sides were good, but with a special note on coleslaw that is not just green mayo mash. eat up fellow carnivores!"
1370,Hallie G.,1129,5,1/22/16,"i am from texas and crave bbq from home a lot. i've tried many bbq eateries in this city and they are horrendous. i have had this place marked for a few years, but after trying multiple bbq here i gave up and started checking in brisket and meats in luggage returning from visits home. best bbq in this city. hands down. now, i do not feel the need to check in luggage filled with brisket ! also, the customer service is another probably best in the city. everyone in there, came to see how we enjoyed our first time and just super nice. this made the full experience we got the half and half platter with a taste of ribs. i had pulled pork, sliced brisket. one of the managers so graciously gave us samples of the other meats as well that included the chopped brisket, and texas sausage . any of the meats, literally cannot go wrong. my favorite, and this is hard is the texas sausage . not many out of staters understand the taste to get the taste just right  and boy did they! the st. louis ribs meaty and fall off the bone completly. used the spicy st louis sauce..superb. sliced brisket delicious as well, charred enough on the outside and little fat as should be. very tender. chopped brisket a little crunch and little tender and more juicy than the sliced. added spicy st louis sauce. pulled pork equally delicious, and pulled enough to just add sauce and eat. tender as well. beans very sweet! i am not a fan of sweet beans, but they were good.  mac and cheese very good, bread crumbs on top and very creamy on the inside ! soo good cannot wait to go back. i will be here anytime i am craving home."
1371,Dinah T.,1129,5,12/20/15,"i have been here a couple of times and it is one of the best bbq joynts that i have ever been to here in chitown! they are also shown on food network tv show diners, driven, and dives. it is a stand alone building at a corner street. there is no parking lot so look for street parking. keep in mind this is a popular little place so during the weekends and prime time dinner hours it is going to get pretty busy...so busy that you will end up waiting in the sunshine, rain, and snow to get in. but the food is worth it! my tip, come during the week or early evening like as soon as it opens so you can get what you want because if there is a long line by the time you get to order they may run out, yeah really... the decor is rustic, to get more seating you may we sitting very close to other people like a community table feel. they play music in the back ground sounded like jazz music to get you into the bbq mood. now keep in mind, bbq meats do get pricey so it is a good idea to know what you want to order ahead of time. while you wait in line, you can see what others are eating and you can see all the awards this place has posted on the walls. for their ribs, they use a memphisstyle dry rub and apple and oak firewood to get that great flavor. they give you sides of bbq sauce not overly sweet. i usually order the following just to let you know the ribs are not precut so be prepared with a knife to cut your meat or get down and dirty and tear that meat apart! it can be messy... the baby back ribs are fall of the bone ribs with a nice crust so you can eat them dry or dip or pour their bbq sauce all over it! the st louis ribs is a meatier kind of ribs you can see the smoke ring around it. eat it as is with the dry rub or pour on that bbq sauce. their brisket is one of my favorites. they cook their meeting for  hours in the smoker and man it is so moist and tender melts in your mouth, oh wait that is the fat yum! i get these sliced or you can get them chopped to order. they put on a light bbq sauce just for the brisket. they also sell pulled pork, chicken, texas sausage which i have seen people eat and they said it is very good. i like the fact that you can also order smaller sizes of these meats to your main order or if you can add it to your salad for those who are cutting the carbs. the sides we get are all premeasured in their own little containers coleslaw thinly shredded slaw that they use a vinegar not a creamy dressing it comes with your meal. i like it, not so much the hubby. bbq beans is very sweet but the beans are cooked well. i liked it. macaroni & cheese it comes it is own cooked container size topped with bread crumbs. both of us like this side i would get it again, if you love mac n cheese then order . cornbread sweet bread reminds me of boston market sweet, it is ok. brisket chili hubby ordered this, good flavor meaty chili hearty he says. overall, great bbq place. i would come back again if i am in the area."
1372,The M.,1129,5,10/9/15,"this place is awesome the food is delicious the mac and cheese is unbelievable the texas sausage , unbelievable, brisket sandwich unbelievable, you are a straight  stars......."
1373,Tori M.,1129,5,9/10/15,"i finally made it here!! the line was out the door but our wait was only about  minutes from walking in until i was stuffing my face. i was surprised that the setup involved ordering at the counter, getting your number called, but then being seated by the staff. no table service though, except to pick up your trash. we got the sliced brisket, texas sausage , pulled pork, side of mac & cheese, fries & cole slaw. the brisket was melt in your mouth good! great texture, visible smoke rings, impeccable flavor. the pulled pork was good too and came with a great bbq sauce on it that was not too overpowering. i was a little bummed by the texas sausage . it is based on rudy's recipe so i had high expectations but the texture was a little tough for my liking. honestly, weber grill's sausage links are much better. all of the sides were good. definitely too much food for two people but we just had to try it all! it is the best bbq i have had in illinois undoubtedly, and i have been to a lot of bbq joints... very reasonably priced & it is byob! ps i wish they offered carolina mustard sauce..."
1374,Annaliza F.,1129,5,6/22/15,"ummm.... i will have some more of you please!!!! =d we decided to finally try this place after my neighbors catered their annual memorial day party from this place. my family ordered the combo ribs, sliced brisket, texas sausage , & our sides were mac & cheese, brisket chili, french fries, cornbread, & peach cobbler for dessert thanks to our neighbors, we have od would on bread pudding.... bless me father for i have sinned by cheating the poop out of cheat day.... oh, we will be back...."
1375,Grace G.,1129,5,6/21/15,"worth the wait in my opinion, i am not a huge bbq eater but i know when the pulled pork is melt in your mouth tender then they are doing something right. just the right amount of charred bark and meat to make me need to take a nap after eating. fries are good, but the mac and cheese was bomb. corn bread is nice and soft and moist. yep, i used the word moist. my parents had the ribs each got the different style and my hubs got the texas sausage . the beans were smoky and have some heat to them. overall we were very satisfied even after waiting about an hour and  minutes. the people in line made it very entertaining. wish i would have brought some brews, forgetting that it is a byob joint, but i will definitely come back. if you do not want to wait, i suggest calling ahead and picking up, the line was long even during nonpeak hours."
1376,PJ B.,1129,1,9/20/18,"shameful singleuse plastic for everything!! barbeque tastes like crap on stryofoam!! bakes beans and mac and cheese taste like crap in styrofoam!! too much plastic!! do not eat at this place. imagine how much plastic and stryofoam they have contributed to the garbage piles!!! no, no no nonononono!!!"
1377,Leigh T.,1129,1,7/5/18,"i wanted to. i had high hopes. nope, no wafting smokiness in the air. should have gotten back on  and driven back north. the standard is high. lem's, or a corner joint on th street...you cannot grow up on the southside and not have had true que. smoque gave me ....reheated, dry, old tasting ribs. this slab of st.louis did not come out of a smoker anytime today. they were reheated in an oven and kinda smothered in that process. there was not a snap to back membrane. there was not a good bark on the meat. really no smoke ring. the rub is nasty and leaves a sour taste in your mouth. sad, if folks think this joint is real barbeque. nope, not."
1378,Sasha S.,1129,1,4/20/18,"this place is so overrated that it hurts. i have been there a few times and every time, the food is dry or cold and overpriced. ever since they got food channel recognition, they went to hell. there are a lot of other bbq places that are better in chicago, this one is just a tourist trap."
1379,Dave S.,1129,1,2/27/18,"limited menu, lack of parking, slow service. food is very salty."
1380,Peter D.,1129,1,9/24/17,tried to place an order for pick uo. called twice. got instantly put on hold for  minutes both times. lost my buisness.
1381,Cadie O.,1129,1,9/17/17,"maybe we went on a bad day, but boy oh boy were we ever disappointed. everything was dry... the cornbread, the bread on the sandwiches, the brisket, the pork. the tea something i consider a staple to bbq was absolutely terrible. the bbq sauce was really runny, straight liquid, basically vinegar. the meats both had a smoky flavor, which was the only plus of this place. overall, a disgrace to the world of bbq!"
1382,Jeffrey D.,1129,1,7/12/17,would not answer the phone with an hour to go before closing time. pretty sad.
1383,Bob A.,1129,1,5/22/17,"this bbq joint is way overrated. yes the food taste is pretty good, but the portions are so small, my  yr old can finish it and still be hungry. hey guys, where is the beef. the sauces are very average tasting, and the parking in that area is very difficult. great job on the smoque, but terrible job on the portions! will not return!"
1384,Ben C.,1129,1,5/20/17,stopped by here after landing in chicago and beginning the drive to detroit. got the chopped brisket and my lady got the sliced. by  am she had the worst case of food poisoning i have ever seen. it was completely disgusting. parking is nonexistent and the neighborhood had signs posted that you were not allowed to park on their street to go to smoques. i thought the meat was dry. maybe it was just an off night based off the  reviews giving it a . star total. but i personally would not return here. ever.
1385,Paul B.,1129,1,2/11/17,"i am writing this as i am throwing up from both holes. this place is way over rated. we got two slabs of ribs, mac and cheese, beans. honestly i do not know what people find delicious about this place. the ribs are ok at best, but both myself and my gf got food poisoning from this place. i knew first bite something"
1386,Reid G.,1129,1,12/16/16,"i seriously cannot understand how an employee can close a togo container without putting any bbq sauce in the container wthe meat?!?!?!?! first day in a long while eating anything more than broccoli for lunch i am an avid healthy eater and you ruined my lunch. thanks. p.s. this is the second time this has happened. how difficult is it to train your employees to understand that most people, when they order meat from a bbq restaurant, want bbq sauce!!!!!!"
1387,Chiquita E.,1129,1,7/17/16,"i really wanted to give this place  stars. i purchased a slab of ribs, sliced brisket and the texas sausages. i also got sides bbq gumbo, mac and cheese and brisket chilli. the sides and the texas sausages were great. the ribs and the sliced brisket were unseasoned. i was extremely disappointed. the bbq sauces are very good that is the only saving grace for the unseasoned ribs and unseasoned brisket. i understand this place is very busy but, unseasoned meat is totally unacceptable."
1388,April C.,1129,1,6/3/16,i was surprised that they served over cook ribs.it was burned and bitter. i am not going back.
1389,Daniel P.,1129,1,5/27/16,"just going to be blunt. reviews looked amazing. it has . stars. it smells good. however everything is absolutely horrendous taste wise. we just spent  dollars for nye ribs and my god not only were they dry to the bone, they were also tough. i am not saying i need my ribs to fall off the bone however i should not have to fight to chew through it. coleslaw was mushy. beans were gag inducing. absolutely a joke. all in all i will never spend another cent here. i advise you to do the same."
1390,Bernard P.,1129,1,2/28/16,"total garbage! take this crap over to the south side or west side, and this would not even pass as roadkill. dry bbq with mediocre sides and a hefty price tag, that is a formula for a  star review. smoque, you definitely earned it."
1391,john s.,1129,1,8/17/15,"tried to order carry out here three times now and . have waited on hold for a minimum  minutes each time, and . been told each time at least  hr to pickup when its a single simple order. no wonder there is a line out the door every time being they cannot have a simple pickup order ready in a reasonable time. smoque you really need to fix your severely broken pickup order side of business!"
1392,Michelle V.,1129,1,6/14/15,there is nothing special about the barbeque. we waited longer to actually place our order than to be seated or get our food. for the price we paid i expected a better atmosphere. even being served water at the table would have made the visit better. the staff was nice but it does not make up for mediocre bbq and a bland atmosphere.
1393,Steve S.,1129,1,5/5/15,"this place used to be a weekly stop for me and my family. i am very displeased to have seen what i have because we loved their food so much however i can no longer subject my family to the sub par cleanliness smoques employees have. when we were walking into the restaurant we witnessed one of there employees oht back with his hand inside his pants scratching himself. he went so far as to inspect the underside of his fingernail after he was finished to see what it was he had picked off. by the time it took me and my family to walk to the door and enter this employee had already assumed his position behind the counter and was handling meat. he was the only one there without gloves on, probably because he forgot but it was clear that he had not had enough time to wash his hands prior. he was a very large heavy set man and when i pointed it out the employee at the register she apologized with a smile and thanked me for the info. i do believe a supervisor overheard the convo but we left before anything was done, if they did anything. this truly upsets me because this is probably the best bbq in the city."
1394,J M.,1129,1,2/4/15,"ok, i was not impressed the first time i went there but wanted to give them another chance tonight. i am sorry to say i was even more disappointed this time. i understand the name is smoque but that does not mean everything has to be smothered in that taste. it was a cross between that and burnt flavored. i am still trying to get the taste out of my mouth. the fries and brisket chili were decent, the baby back ribs and chicken were not. this was definitely not worth .. i will not be back."
1395,K N.,1129,1,1/9/15,"i have heard mixed reviews about smoque so i was eager to try it. meh, i was not missing much. my friend and i walked in right before the lunch hour mayhem so, we were able to order and sit down immediately. my goto is pulled pork and theirs was pretty dry. the bunbread the pulled pork was served on was not complimentary either. and their bbq sauce, aside from being extremely runny, tasted off. i took a bite of my friend's rib meat and that was really dry, too. maybe some people prefer dry rubbed ribs over the kind of ribs that fall off the bone, i do not. overall, i think smoque is over priced. i honestly believe i can make a better pulled pork sandwich at home."
1396,Roberta B.,1129,1,12/23/14,"i had a horrendous experience at smoke tonight. when i arrived at  pm i was in formed in a belligerent tone that no brisket was available tonight. since brisket is the primary attraction of smoque, the restaurant was rendered useless by virtue of this fact. imagine mcdonald's without hamburgers or hot dougs without hotdogs. that is the equivalent of smoque without brisket. there is no excuse for this type of indifference to your customers. if this continues smoque will no longer be a destination restaurant. i certainly will not be going back."
1397,Bon D.,1129,1,10/30/14,"we were truly disappointed with the taste of food, service and high prices. we will not be going back to the smoqued in orange, ca and will let everyone we know not to get rip off by going there."
1398,Jeannette R.,1129,1,9/15/14,not a fan. i have had better ribs down the street at la villa. no offense but for however long we waited it most definitely was not worth the wait or price for the ribs. meh
1399,Michelangelo V.,1129,1,8/1/14,honest review okay do not come here i was excited because they said this is the best barbeque in chicago its not at all trust me its supper expensive n the portions are so small m its a very small restaurant the entres were cold n gross the sides were great the bread puddin was great i would jus go back for the sides n that not the actual barbeque if you want the best barbeque go to hog wild on th its amaizing supper cheap n the portions are huge
1400,Saro O.,1129,1,7/11/14,"great sides, terrible everything else. no idea why this place gets a line except for hipsters trying too hard in the nw side. also the setup inside seems create to make a line so it looks like something is going on here. tons of better places for b b q."
1401,Dotty K.,1129,1,4/6/14,not worth the wait in the long line tried the baby back ribs and brisket. preferred the ribs over the brisket. brisket lacked flavor. the line was long but moving fast. they did a good job in helping people with seating.
1402,Neil F.,1129,1,1/22/14,the chicken was terrible! the sausage was not even close to what bbq should be. i would have rather had a bbq chicken hot pocket! the sides were decent but that is not what makes a restaurant good. i am not a food snob or a bbq snob but this was some of the worst bbq i have ever had. the smokey flavor tasted like it was sprayed on like people spray on tans. i am sure they are nice people but the food was super disappointing.
1403,Mel S.,1129,1,1/20/14,"not a fan....i have been here at least  times because of the reviews, my friends and all the good things you hear about this place all the time. i want it to be good, i really do. that is why i keep going back, but i think i have finally given up. i have tried all the different meats. i want to be part of the crowd that loves this place, i just cannot seem to get into it. the sauce is decent, but that is about all this place has going for it. the ribs are never fall off the bone, the pulled pork needs the sauce, its dry and the brisket....nothing special. sorry all of you smoque lovers out there, but it just does not work.  the bread for the sandwiches....nothing special, always seems likes it is on the stale side, the fries...blah. i could go on, but you get the picture."
1404,Chris J.,1129,1,7/30/13,"the problem with chicago is no one can do bbq and this place has no exception. cold, dry, chopped pork. the sauce is a mix of a typical bbq saucepaste with some vinegar, which is just enough to drive this city wild with excitement calling it revolutionary. do yourself a favor and buy a plane ticket with the money it would cost you to purchase a sandwich here and fly to any place in the south and figure out what real bbq really is before ranting and raving. this place is not diverse or anything special, it is truly just a cash crop for the owners and has quite the poorest wait staff i have ever experienced, it seems a bit useless to even have waiters if you have to get your own food."
1405,Jo P.,1129,1,6/26/13,"do not get the ribs! these were a dry rub and the meat itself was dry and very smokey i guess that it why they call it smoque. the worse part was that my fingers smelled like smoke for the rest of the day, after washing my hands a couple of times. it was so overwhelming that it literally made me sick to smell that all day. the only thing to remove the smell was a scented lotion. in fact, it is making me sick right now... just thinking about it. i cannot speak for the rest of the food."
1406,Leslie A.,1129,1,2/15/13,really overrated. there is nothing special about this place. the people who work here are not that nice. and i ordered a pulled pork sandwich... it was sooo dry and bland. not worth it.
1407,Andre B.,1129,1,1/8/13,"i tried this place solely based on the reviews it has here on yelp. i do not understand why it has such great rating but the food was not good. i ordered pulled pork sandwich with chili and corn bread. the sauce that came on the pork was very blend no spicing. the part of the pork that i tried without sauce it was very hard to swallow. i had to drench the pork in very water down sauce in order to be able to eat it. chili was also lacking the kick of spicing, i took one bite of cornbread and left the rest. the person i came with also did not like the food. this place is just as much good bbq as is chipotle good authentic latin food. tried this place once and will never go back. very disappointed."
1408,Dave K.,1129,1,12/26/12,"you have never eaten at a real bbq place, you will think this is great. if you have had real bbq before, you will know this is a waste of time. protip to the owner learn how to trim a brisket before you smoke it. not only is an inch of fat on brisket unappetizing, but it does not allow the fat to render properly or smoke or smoque if you are being cute to penetrate the meat."
1409,Anna V.,1129,1,10/7/11,ewwwww!!! my bbq ribs had a taste & smell of gasoline!!!
1410,Sara V.,1129,1,9/1/11,"i do not know what ya will are smoquein, but smoque is a joke for bbq. i went with a texan and we both agreed the best thing we had was the sixpack of beer we brought in. he tried the brisket and i had the pulled pork... the pork was dry and flavorless. i tried their bbq sauce... well i actually mean their taco bell sauce. seriously it really tastes like taco bell sauce. the owner could see i did not like the sauce and brought me two other sauces. still no better. really runny and really bad flavor. the corn bread was dry and flavorless. the cole slaw was vinegary and soggy, but not a good soggy. the actual best part of the food we had was the bbq beans. was the only thing i cared to finish... all in all a bust. i would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason. go to fat willy's. even twin anchors is better, even carson's....  how there is always a line there, i do not know, but i guess you fans have never had truly good bbq!"
1411,Mary S.,1129,1,6/23/11,"their catering service is a mess. we used to call the day before to order takeout ribs for small family parties. now they make you go through catering. i called on thursday morning for a saturday family dinner and they said they were at capacity. that is not good business. will never return nor recommend smoque in the future. too bad. their ribs are pretty good. btw, called lillie's q right after. very accomondating and their ribs are right up there. sorry smoque. you got too big for your britches!"
1412,James M.,1129,1,6/12/11,"after dozens of trips here for the great bbq and being wellacquainted with the controlled chaos that is smoque, last night the chaos was frankly uncontrolled and we left feeling like we would been abused. normal sized line, yet after we ordered we then had to stand around for about  minutes waiting for our chow, vs. the usual  this is after ordering. the place was jammed, shoulder to shoulder to the extent that you could not move. want to get to the drink dispenses  forget it, hopeless. we were at the point of abandoning our  and just leaving when we finally got to sit down. when we said something to the staff they said this is normal. well, as i said we have been there dozens of times and it was not normal. at one point i counted close to  people in there, when the sign says occupancy by more that  is illegal and dangerous. yes, it was. as far as we could tell the kitchen was in meltdown, and there were long pauses where no food was served up whatsoever. then it became so out of order it was a a joke  at one point they were calling numbers in the 's and the s at the same time. it finally became apparent that the problem was they would run out of ribs ready to serve, when suddenly trays started flying off the counter. only problem? the ribs we finally got were so dry and overcooked they could better have been served with a pickaxe. if they would served them when they were done rather than overdone all would likely have been fine. there are hundreds of other rib joints in chicago and i am walking with my feet and giving some other places a try."
1413,D Y.,1129,1,5/31/11,honky tonk kills smoque. smoque i hear was really really good back in the day now its like everyone else in chicago who was really good. their service on the other hand is really good. the gentlemen who work away from the counter anticipate your needs. oh well.
1414,Joan K.,1129,1,4/13/11,"wow i was disappointed last nite. what is going on? been here a number of times and the meat has been great but noticeably starting to change. this time brisket was dry as a bone and st louis ribs were as well. thank goodness for some sauce to help ease that used to be moist and delectable dry brisket meat down. i am hoping the popularity of this gem has not begun to ruin the quality.  places get popular and quality starts suffering. please smoque, do not go that route."
1415,Eugene S.,1129,4,9/2/17,"great bbq! three thumbs up, lol... in my arnold schwarzenegger voice i will be back, lol...."
1416,Kieran H.,1129,5,4/20/18,"after being spoiled in st. louis, i was concerned that chicago could not satisfy. smoque has proven that i was mistaken. it is consistently my favorite bbq in chicago. the stl style ribs have a flavorful rub and the meat falls of the bone. fries and slaw are idyllic. when i save room a difficult feat the bread pudding is a joy. their service is great and they seem to give job opportunities to local kids. also, smoque is reasonably priced for a bbq joint."
1417,Paige D.,1129,5,10/17/17,"we ordered brisket and a half slab of st. louis dry rub ribs, along with two sides each plus slaw. we left with another meal in leftovers! we thought the meat was the star of the show, though we were pleasantly surprised with the nonmayoy slaw. meat fell off the bone and nothing required a knife. highly recommended  go hungry!"
1418,David T.,1129,5,2/16/18,"terrific bbq and really affordable compared to most other bbq joints. if we were in the area longer, we would definitely be going back here again. check it out if you find yourself near here. the staff was great too, super friendly."
1419,L M.,1129,5,7/21/18,as good as the other reviews suggest. baby back ribs are the best. brisket also excellent but not sure why others are sweating it so hard. get the ribs. just go there.
1420,Kenny Y.,1129,4,1/19/17,"would not have noticed this place if it was not featured on diners, driveins and dives. it definitely lives up to the hype though  the meat is tender and the sauce is delicious. the ribs and the brisket are the specialties and they are both pretty amazing. expect to large portions and not much in the way of vegetables. at the end of the meal i was very full but i kind of did want a bit more of the cole slaw and mac and cheese. if you have space at the end, definitely try the bread pudding."
1421,Ella P.,1129,3,3/28/18,not really what i expected. it is good bbq but it is not the best i have ever had. the brisket was better than the ribs but they all had way too much sauce and it leaves you with an upset stomach. mac & cheese is my favorite but i was very disappointed in theirs. it tasted like leftovers that were warmed up. the corn bread is very good  not dry at all. the prices are a bit high but they usually are for bbq places. would go again sometime.
1422,Christine C.,1129,5,1/8/16,"if i could eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would be here. everything i have tried here is amazing. the sliced brisket plate with mac and cheese and fries is a must. but the star of the show is the sweet jalapeo. i always ask for  cups of these because they are so dang good. the crunch of the jalapeos with the brisket is heaven. i highly highly recommend them. thank me later. the only downside of this place is the size. it gets super busy around dinner time and you sometimes have to wait in line for awhile, but it is so worth it. i would not recommend coming here with a big group because of the limited tables. if i could give this place  stars, i definitely would."
1423,Felicia B.,1129,4,5/3/18,"make sure you call and order ahead of time so you only need to pickup when you are there. waiting for your food to get ready when you are hungry is no fun! at home we found out that they left out one whole slab of bbq that should have been included in the bag. good thing they have great customer service so they had it delivered to our house free of charge. it was just the waiting part that is frustrating. still, mouth watering food as always."
1424,Chris M.,1129,5,7/29/17,"we pulled in here on our way out of chicago. arrived at  a.m. and went right to the counter to order. got very busy soon after. very friendly staff. quite the assembly line pumping out the orders. nice ambience. lots of outdoor seating. got the sliced brisket platter with two sides, mac n cheese and fries. they throw in coleslaw as well. added a quarter slab of st. louis ribs for an extra . the brisket was incredible. great smoke, great bark, super tender. the ribs were very good but a little chewy, not as tender. the mac n cheese was excellent, cheesy with a nice crust. the fries were delicious and a generous portion. the coleslaw was different, like just cabbage dressed lightly with vinegar. refreshing but not my favorite."
1425,Taina R.,1129,4,3/21/18,my daughter love this place they go after school and get fries with bbq sauce. lol bbq is delicious and the sausage is spice but good.
1426,Danny W.,1129,5,11/8/16,"this is chicago. we are not exactly a bbq town, but when a place has over k reviews and a  and half star average you are doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out. the other day i did and i got to say, smoque lived up to the hype. go to texas, and you will wait in a hour long line for ribs that are really close to as tasty as these. the fact that you can get them in under  minutes on a sunday is just unreal. not to mention it is actually pretty darn cheap too. full slab with  sides was about  which was way less than i was expecting. the place is a machine. line moves quick, your food comes out in the blink of an eye, and there is always a staffer there to answer your questions. the only other advice i will offer than has not really been said is to order more than you can eat. cold bbq the next day is actually really underrated."
1427,James P.,1129,5,1/27/16,"cost . sliced brisket w  side . chopped brisket w  side .  slab baby back ribs .  slab st louis style ribs . x  cornbread . peach cobbler with salted caramel and bourbon  yum! and breathe! yes, between a friend and i we really ordered and ate all that food. it was bbq heaven. we would have ordered chicken and pulled pork too, but they were out of it! i guess this just gives me an excuse to go back in. my favorites off the platters we ordered were the baby back ribs and sliced brisket with the memphis bbq sauce. the peach cobbler was to die for as well! byob which is awesome and we came on a friday night. the line was about through the door, but the wait was not terrible at all! it took about  minutes from the door to order to sitting down and having your food called out. i will be back for sure!"
1428,Cree J.,1129,4,10/21/17,decided to visit this place because of the reviews and i must say the food was good....ribs are very tasty and tender. service was prompt and staff were nice. place is kinda small but who cares i will go again
1429,Hallie G.,1129,5,1/22/16,"i am from texas and crave bbq from home a lot. i've tried many bbq eateries in this city and they are horrendous. i have had this place marked for a few years, but after trying multiple bbq here i gave up and started checking in brisket and meats in luggage returning from visits home. best bbq in this city. hands down. now, i do not feel the need to check in luggage filled with brisket ! also, the customer service is another probably best in the city. everyone in there, came to see how we enjoyed our first time and just super nice. this made the full experience we got the half and half platter with a taste of ribs. i had pulled pork, sliced brisket. one of the managers so graciously gave us samples of the other meats as well that included the chopped brisket, and texas sausage. any of the meats, literally cannot go wrong. my favorite, and this is hard is the texas sausage. not many out of staters understand the taste to get the taste just right  and boy did they! the st. louis ribs meaty and fall off the bone completly. used the spicy st louis sauce..superb. sliced brisket delicious as well, charred enough on the outside and little fat as should be. very tender. chopped brisket a little crunch and little tender and more juicy than the sliced. added spicy st louis sauce. pulled pork equally delicious, and pulled enough to just add sauce and eat. tender as well. beans very sweet! i am not a fan of sweet beans, but they were good.  mac and cheese very good, bread crumbs on top and very creamy on the inside ! soo good cannot wait to go back. i will be here anytime i am craving home."
1430,Annie Z.,1130,5,11/5/18,"i have dreamed of dining at alinea for over  years now. it is hard to anticipate something for so long and fantasize about it but still have it meet and exceed expectations. the thousands of glowing reviews speak for themselves, but alinea is on another level! this is not just a restaurant, it is an entire experience. there are reasons why everything is placed and set the way they are. even the minor annoyance of dining as a party of   when booking tickets i found this requirement to be very cumbersome, but once i dined there the experience was much better with more friends than just my significant other. their attention to detail is also remarkable. they waitress overheard us as we were leaving and offered to help us obtain a reservation at the aviary. once there, they knew our allergies, celebrations, and even our food allergies. amazing! everything is a surprise so without ruining too much, i loved it so much i would love to come back again next time i have an opportunity to visit chicago. thank you chef grant achatz for making my birthday unforgettable!"
1431,Ari P.,1130,5,11/1/18,"a once in a lifetime experience that i am no lucky enough to have been two twice. i was honestly a bit worried that dishes from my last visit  years ago would be repeated not that they were bad at all, but rather so creative i thought they were signatures. the only repeat was the now famous dessert balloon. i do not want to share too much and spoil the fun surprises at dinner. alinea is a world class restaurant that keeps getting better. this is not a restaurant where technique is a gimmick it easily could go that way but chef grant who was there making sure things were as they should be for dinner on a monday night, and nice enough to wish my brother good luck on a new endeavor. amazingly the food was delicious and the experimental techniques and environment only support it wagyu rossini with rossini anyone?. it used to be like the meal was a show and now it feels like an adventure. watch chefs table and read life on the line before you go! only complaints are that the lucite table top was a bit cracked and server told us it was vintage."
1432,Cuc N.,1130,5,10/30/18,"wow. i do not even know where to begin to even portray, literally, the best meal i have ever had in my lifetime, and probably for all of my lifetime. even from my small handful of michelin's and fine dining experiences, nothing prepared me for the endless surprises, the captivating experiences from the variety of ambiences, flavors in all of my senses. did that even make sense? i will try to relive my experience at alinea.. put into words. but i already know that nothing i say, no picture i take, will even make you guys understand why this was the best meal i have ever had. you can also watch chef's table, season , episode , that features chef grant achatz and his restaurant alinea. the episode gives a brief biography of the chef, which i am so grateful to have watched the next evening after my meal because it gave me a whole new found respect for the chef and his creations. it also did not ruin the surprise for me. did i mention, this is the first time i did not research anything online, on yelp, whatsoever. i just went by my friend's word. we must eat here in chicago. it is a  michelin star restaurant. it used to be # in the entire world at one point. now it is like # or # or #. but whatever it is, it is still top  best restaurants in the world. i asked our waiter, will we get a copy of the menu at the end so that we know what we ate? he replies, this is your menu. everything is on there. it was a crossword puzzle! or not that one.. the other one. let us find the words! throughout our meal, we found words before or after we were already served the food. so it was fun to play with, fun to guess with. i remember at one point, we circled nostalgia and we kept wondering.. wow is this dish nostalgic? no.. this one is... no, wait, this dish is nostalgic! just this simple menu game kept us guessing, kept us engaging with each other, kept us intrigued with our food. but that is not just it. it was not just about food anymore. it was about experience and surprises and emotions. i will not get into detail because i do not want to ruin the surprise... not everything is going to be what it seems. he likes to trick the senses. what may smell like something is something else. what tastes like something is something else. what looks like something is something else. you will be surprised at every turn in every way possible. you get a little field trip to the kitchen "
1433,Bailey Z.,1130,3,10/22/18,"i have been waiting so long to try alinea. even before the chef's table episode. was it overhyped? were the expectations too high? possibly, but what it came down to was the flavor of the food. it is hard to even explain the degustation journey that we embarked on, but i think of the  menu items we tried, there were few that stuck out, flavorwise. there were also many interesting textures, but not the ones that were particularly enjoyable. it was also tough to understand any cohesive theme as many displayed use of molecular gastronomy but i think it was used to showcase the technique rather than the food. we started with a communal salad with avocado, kiwi, cucumber, and herbs with a light dressing sprayed on with a perfume sprayer. there were whispers that it felt like we were eating just flowers. the best part was the little brioche bun that came with the salad. biting into it, i was surprised with the filling of mushroom, feta cheese, and jalapeno. we were then whisked alway to a tour of the kitchen where we had a drink and a small bite with puffed pizza dough gnocco fritto filled with caramelized mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, brushed with rendered pepperoni, and dusted with tomato powder, fennel pollen, and garnished with fresh basil. when we returned, our communal table had been broken down into our individual tables which was a fun surprise. from then on, we the meal became a blur as we had plate after plate of visuallystimulating dishes. i did enjoy the cultured charred onion cream  that smokey smell still lingers in my mind. the sunflower petals with toasted sunflower seed custard, sunflower leaf oil and golden osetra caviar was a beautiful presentation. the scallop, mustard, and chili thai noodle dish was the most flavorful dish of the evening and a standout. the shot of lemongrass that accompanied it was one of the most visually appeasing dishes, which glowed in the dark dining room. the next few dishes including the korean bbq glazed octopus with pyrolyzed negi onions, the nori roll, and the langoustine paper were misses for me. although fun, the clam chowder, with the potato that had been cooking in front of us was one of the biggest misses. i really did not enjoy the flavor of that chowder. the next course after this was the wagyu, foie gras, and matsutake. how can you screw up wagyu at a three star michelin restaurant? you cannot. the wagyu, pan roasted with herbs, garlic, pepper and butter was kept simple and amazing as it usually is and one of my favorite bites. we dined to the music of composer gioachino rossini. the next dish, many at the table did not enjoy, nor finish. the chilled peach and begonia soup, heirloom tomatoes, mascarpone, nasturtium and honey was too chilled to enjoy, but i did enjoy that lovely heirloom tomato flavor. the transition dish with palo santo ice cream, charred tamarind meringue, grilled pineapple and candied hoja santa was also a great dish. loved this as a dessert. it was served with mexican hot chocolate milk punch. the next couple of nolstagic dishes featured the classic helium sugar balloon which was green apple flavored. the caramel popcorn liquid was also a fun presentation. then, of course the finale with the multitude of frozen treats and sweets that were painted on our table was quite the spectacle. i think both chef grant achatz and simon davies are creative geniuses and are doing amazing things. overall, if you come here, view it more as performance art that you are paying a hefty price for. we spent . gratuity and tax included on tock for a meal in the gallery. was it worth it for the food? probably not. was it worth it for the experience once? definitely!"
1434,Edward W.,1130,5,10/27/18,"overall sentiment of alinea is a must try! this place blows you away with the smoke and mirrors and takes dining to a whole new level. i ordered the wine pairing, which was hit or miss. some pairings were excellent while others left me wondering what happened. i personally would not get it again. the entire meal is  courses along with  wine pairings. i see this meal as a fully immersive experience instead of treating every course as it is own individual thing. highlights of the meal. foie gras and black caviar mix. orange cocoa nibs squid ink balls  fully dark tasting experience a wagyu  savory and earthy. pairs well with the earthy wine. grandiose classical music as the meat is being cut and served. meat was not as hot as it could have been since it took them awhile to serve it. edible balloon dessert finale spoilers the meal begins with everyone seated at a long table. after a short stint into the kitchen, we came back to the dining room to find that all the tables had been rearranged to be more intimate. very novel and demonstrates how important the arrangement of the furniture can be. the finale is at the very end when the dessert arrives. never had anything quite like it and it was certainly splashy and delicious at the same time. they take the decorations hanging from the ceiling and create the dessert in front of you."
1435,Frank K.,1130,5,11/8/18,"what a delight. the entrance is unassuming. once you enter through the doors, you are greeted by the alinea team. everyone including the wait staff, maitre d, sommelier and the chef were friendly and seemed to genuinely care about your dining experience. we were pleasantly surprised with each dish. we elected for the seasonal supplement white truffles which was a pleasant addition to our experience.  wine pairing was nicely done. will not go into specific details of the dishes as there are wonderful elements of wow and surprises that should not be spoiled. helium filled apple taffy ballon was a hit with everyone in our group and filled the dining room with laughter from each table. every detail has been looked into even down to the coat check where the coats were warmed for your comfort."
1436,Alex M.,1130,5,10/29/18,"i am going to do like most people and refrain from writing , , words, attempting to summarize this experience. because you cannot. logistically, reservations go live  months in advance at am on the th. you choose your ticket to the show, and prepay in advance, with a variety of packages  budgets available. no refunds, so make sure your group is solid. they typically prefer seating in 's, so great doubledate spot... just as long as this is not your first date.... or th. would not be bad spot to take the parents either, but definitely leave the kids with the babysitter on this one. leading up, whoever made the reservation will correspond with a team member, on a couple of occasions, to confirm attendance and cover any dietary restrictions. one of our group members is a veg, and i am allergic to shellfish, so they modified accordingly. after we sat down, they confirmed who was who, and never again was there a mention or a mixup. as a matter of fact, at the end of the meal i said something along the lines of despite tonight's selections being laden with shellfish, i would not have known i had a substitute unless i had been told. so there should not be any concern about diluting the experience. inside of the establishment is regal it is an elegant dining room that their family is sharing with us. we are dining with them, as the waitstaff are incredibly friendly, knowledgable and fun. they were pretty playful with our group, which added to the experience. dress is pretty casual most men were dressed in blazers, and women in dresses. this was a lastsecond audible for me another friend backed out so i came in my barron's and a bomber and did not feel judged. i will defer on addressing the food or sharing pictures despite how incredible many of them turned out. the menu rotates often, plus, it is almost certainly more fun to be surprised. there is some really amazing twists and turns along the way. for those that read my reviews, i travel to nyc and la often to visit friends, and love to indulge in fine dining.this is hands down the best place i have ever been to, and it is really not close. my buddy who came with me said it compared nicely to emp, albeit a much different experience than that is. i think setting expectations heading in is important. if you want the best food you have ever had in your life, you are misunderstanding the allure of places like this. it is a celebration of culinary arts. everything is intentional! the plates, seating arrangements, decor, presentation, armoas, glasses, and so forth. the attention to detail is astonishing, the team is so wellrehearsed. this is not simply dinner, this is an experience, a show, if you will. and one i will likely remember for the rest of my life. "
1437,Laney B.,1130,5,10/27/18,"my boyfriend and i ate here this past wednesday and it is taken me almost a week to put my experience into words... and believe you me, i am never at a loss for words. i initially wanted to write a review that detailed every dish, choreography and everything in between but then i felt guilty at the though of potentially ruining other people's experiences. this will for sure be one of my shortest reviews on yelp, and this is it alinea is a culinary experience. more than an experience, it is like an artistic expression and so much more. the best meal i have ever had. the professionalism, ingredients, execution, choreography, ingenuity of each course, and laid back style are second to none. the staff is incredible and the restaurant is not stuffy or pretentious. legit. the. best. meal. i have. ever. had. do yourself a favor right now and do not read any more reviews. go experience alinea it is more than just food."
1438,Stanley W.,1130,4,10/6/18,"a fantastic experience i think everyone should try at least once if they have the chance. alinea is undoubtedly one of the most unique places i have had the pleasure to dine at. strangely, with all the glamour and showmanship, my favourite part of the night was how perfectly cooked the bincho charcoal seared squab was. it was, perhaps some of the best squab i have had in a long while and i could not help but think back to it every single time i have had squab since. strange then, that this comparatively simple dish left such an impression over all these amazingly creative plates. do not get me wrong, alinea was great, and it certainly had its fair share of moments which i do not want to spoil in a review. but i have been wowed more elsewhere and it was not as memorable as i had expected. i was at the salon twice. maybe a gallery seating would change my mind."
1439,Tory G.,1130,5,11/4/18,alinea is an amazing experience. the food is delicious and very unique but the presentation is definitely the main reason to visit. our experience lasted almost three hours and it was a show from beginning to the end! the best part was getting to visit the kitchen for a cocktail and a small bite to eat.
1440,Stephy L.,1130,4,9/18/18,"what a once in a life time experience. i can understand why it received  michelin stars and is rated within the best  restaurants in the world! although i heard that past menus since they change their menus every so often was way better than what i had. reservations are hard to come by, make sure you read when you can sign up for reservations. i believe it is every th of the month at like am or some early time depending on what time zone you are in, that you can reserve for the next month or two. i booked it right when it came out and since i was going on a holiday weekend, it sold out instantly. i was lucky enough to get my hands on a pm reservation though. we did the cheaper tier since there are two prices. the more costly tier allows you to sit at the chefs table and has more display artwork with the food. it is nice that you prepaid for it so you go there and simply enjoy. although we added  wine glasses and a wine pairing to our bill since we did not book that beforehand. everything is a surprise. all we are given is this wordsearch on the table that has part of what we are eating on it. it was hard not glancing at other people's tables to see what they were having. each item came out and each was delicious and different from anything we had before. the food kept surprising us. at one point during dinner, they invited everyone in the room to go downstairs to the kitchen to enjoy a bite and drink, which i thought was unique and fantastic. in the kitchen, it was cool to see them mass make plates and to absorb everything in. once our bite was over, we went back upstairs to continue our dinner. i do not want to spoil the menu but the dessert was aboslutely amazing. that banana looked so real and it was sooooooooo good. the instagram photos that you normally see is the candy balloon. it is difficult to take a photo with it. unfortunately, my boyfriend's balloon deflated when it got to him, but our server was nice to get a new one. but by the time he got a new one, my deflated and we were not able to get a nice photo together with it. we did, however, suck the helium in and our voices were squeaky momentarily. overall, we enjoyed the experience. i think people over hyped it for me that i did not believe it was amaaaaazing like oh my god, but it was definitely an experience. i do not know if i would do it again, maybe in the long future. the price is really decent for a  michelin stars, given that anything in the bay area is at that price already for  star or less."
1441,Sneha P.,1130,5,9/19/18,"chef achatz's mastery of flavor, cooking techniques and his creativity will surely get a nod from even the pickiest eaters. it does not take long to realize that you expect the unexpected at alinea starting with the menu which is presented as a crossword puzzle. the highlights of the night included the ranina, ranina, pizza puff, perfume course with the scallops, and the squab roasted in coal. each meal is arranged with such care, precision and timed perfectly for a harmonious meal. from amuse bouches to tantalize your taste buds to palate cleansers before dessert, you certainly get a range of little bites over the course of your meal. i also enjoyed the kitchen tour and the whole night lived up to the hype. there was only one dish that really did not agree with me but  is not bad at all. because of their ever changing menu, i have heard rumors that the previous dishes were more outstanding but i think that varies with the individual's preference. balloon and the banana dessert were just awesome do it for the gram. now the price and the ease of getting a reservation was my least favorite part haha i live on the east coast and it is easier to get reservations in new york cities finest restaurants than it is to get one at alinea. the price is also more than some of the  michelin star restaurants such as eleven madison park in nyc but the gallery offers much more tastings which validates the price. i finally managed to get a reservation at the salon and i think it was well worth it. getting a table at the gallery requires much more preplanning and time but i am sure it is worth it. i did enjoy my salon experience very much but hopefully i will be back for the whole shebang another time. after eating at countless restaurants casual & fine dining alike, i can vouch for the experience at alinea  there is nothing that comes close to it. every chef can cook a delicious meal but how many actually dare to get you outside your comfort zone and make you pay attention to your surroundings? bravo, bravo, bravo! and do yourself a favor and do not try to research too much before your reservation. half the fun is in the surprise!"
1442,Eric F.,1130,5,10/30/18,"i find alinea a tough restaurant to review. my experience there was a mixture of revelation and disappointment, but i am giving it a reluctant five stars because overall it was a very memorable experience. alinea is a bucket list restaurant. a trip down alice's rabbit hole. it is expensive very expensive and difficult to get a reservation. upon being seated we were served an amuse bouche, in the form of a little clay pot filled with frozen snow of some kind, fish roe, and some edible flowers and herbs. was it delicious? not really, but it was interesting. i will not go over every course in detail. some were very delicious, some were slightly disappointing. there were some theatrical surprises that were definitely brilliant, like when liquid nitrogen is poured over the centrepiece of oranges and you are completely engulfed in a fog of citrusy smoke while eating some orangeshaped bites on a glowing plate, filled with an intense cloveflavoured liqueur. it is an almost overwhelmingly intense sensory experience that is beyond simple categories like delicious. i am not sure if it was delicious. it was intense, nostalgic and... what is the right word? beautiful. some of the dishes presented flavours i had never experienced before. i could almost feel my brain creating new neural pathways as it tried to grapple with them. i even had vivid flavour flashbacks the next day  something i have never experienced before the memory of redolent juniper smoke, the rich umami of bouillabaisse with it is reconstituted langoustine noodle. if i could do it all over again i would have skipped the wine pairings and gone for more courses. the wine was good, but was actually overkill for the small courses a full glass with every course. i sometimes felt rushed to finish the wine before the next course arrived and felt a bit tipsy by the end of the meal. then of course there is the edible helium balloon. it is hard to give a meal that ends with an edible balloon less than five stars, even though there were some bumps and disappointments along the way."
1443,Tiffany W.,1130,5,9/10/18,booked  mths ahead for an early bday celebration for hubby. i also watched the chef's table episode on netflix before we went. heard so much about the restaurant and the chef. flew from los angeles to chicago just for this meal and of course touring around the city. i will let my pictures tell the story rather than ruining the experience for you. just go with an open mind let your eyes enjoy the food of cirque de soleil performance and allow your taste buds to embrace every bit of flavor dancing about in your mouth. it felt like we woke up from a sweat dream...it will be a meal to remember for a lifetime!
1444,Nichole X.,1130,5,8/13/18,"you can always find excellent food at many restaurants, but not too often can you have so much fun while enjoying delicious food. the experience at alinea was very unique and entertaining, which made alinea a step above other restaurants. it seems like they change their menu quite often, so it probably will not help much listing the dishes we had last night. overall, the food was delicious, but some dishes are too savory for me. what impressed me the most was alinea put a lot of thought in presenting the food. the plate was nicely decorated and the way the food was delivered was entertaining. for example, they lit up a bowl of salt while we had some octopus. the room was dark, so it felt like we were deep in the ocean. after the dish was finished, they turned on the lights and dug out a potato from that pile of salt and start preparing clam chowder. surprises are also throughout the meal. who would have thought they put two vanillapodlooking beef jerky in a vanilla jar lol. we also got a chance to enjoy one dish in their kitchen and they totally changed the dining room setting when we are back. although the meal took us  hours, we had a blast. hopefully we can get enough people next time so we can try the kitchen table."
1445,Silvia G.,1130,5,7/11/18,"alinea has  well deserved michelin stars and has been on the list of the best restaurants in the us and it surely lives up to the hype! after years of planning, we finally decided to make a reservation just a few weeks prior and were lucky to secure a reservation at the salon nd floor. we had about  courses in  hours and were very full at the end. each one was creative and stimulated all senses. do not expect a traditional steak or lobster here. everything is infused and almost transformed into a unique shape, color or flavor. molecular gastronomy. the taste is good but it is mainly the presentation and the experience that blows your mind and stimulates all five senses. be prepared to be surprised along the way. we had . terrarium avocado and beautiful herbs and jelly on a bed of iceberg. smoked osetra with an edible sunflower . ranina ranina crab, curry, liquid oranges . black squid ink pasta . langoustine paper in a broth . scallop dumpling infused with lavender . clam chowder made in front of you . morel . squab seared with coal . a tube with a pineapplealoe shot . banana split with a green apple balloon. be sure to inhale the helium and say something! the service is great and the menu does change every couple months so everyone's experience will be slightly different. i especially enjoyed a field trip to the kitchen where they showed us a shaker for our cocktails and of course the famous sugar balloon. hands down, the best culinary experience i have ever had!"
1446,Lisa W.,1130,3,9/17/18,"there is no doubt that grant is an excellent, creative, innovative chef. and there is no doubt that the food here is really good, deserving its  michelin status. everything was made very well to the very last details and surroundings. so then... what is the deal? where is the protein? we felt like all we ate was air, foam, and essence of something good. where was the actual food that they took the essence of? can we have that too? we left hungry afterwards... and that was not even the gallery menu selection. maybe that was our first mistake? i made reservations on the very first day it opened at  but someone beat me to it, and i had to settle with the salon menu... which is  course tasting menu. but now that i think about it, it would have been even more disappointing if that was the menu plus a bit more courses and had to pay more for gallery experience. i cannot speak for anyone else's experience because the menu often changes. let us just say when we came, the menu was the worst menu for a  michelin star that we tasted we had our fair share. and to correct myself, worst as in the menu lacked substance and protein, not creativity. it was just like, that was it??? feeling you get when you ate something and it was the end, then thought to yourself, what did i eat and was that it? where is the rest of it? there were  different items but  main courses. everything was made in a unique, innovative way... the most disappointing part was what was cooking in front of us in the fire turned out to be a potato a potato?! and they mashed that and made that into their version of clam chowder with the chowder being a foam essence of clam. but the worst menu item was the main entre came and it was a sonoma squab literally a size of nickel or quarter at most cooking by a coal in front of you. the squab was flavorless, and their homemade bbq sauce was like a sad overly sweet version of mexican mole and this berry sauce. i did not know what i was eating but it was not good. if you are expecting protein, forget it. i swear i felt like i was a vegetarian, kept saying where is the protein? the presentation and the way it was made was super cool and creative and i did enjoy the show but not food. sad to say i had no favorite dishesnone stood out and no flavors blew my mind. do i regret coming here and spending ish for  people salon,  wine pairing, auto gratuity, taxes? no, it was still a good experience. and i love trying different  stars fine dining whenever i can. but at least now i know i am not really missing anything great. i blame netflix. haha."
1447,Christopher M.,1130,5,7/22/18,"first and foremost  the food and the theater of it all is as incredible, if not moreso, as you think it would be. there is just no giving alinea less than a full  stars based on those criteria alone. i would advise against splurging for the wine pairings, though, especially the alinea pairing. a la carte is the way to go here. the various wines were fitting and complimented the dishes well, but they did not add nearly enough to the experience to justify the ridiculously expensive rare alinea selection. there really is no overstating how incredible the food is, though. an undeniably singular experience that is worth whatever hassle you have to go through to make this happen."
1448,Haley S.,1130,5,7/19/18,"i am not sure what i can add to alinea. it is quite the experience, and one worth having if you are able. worth the hype even as a vegetarian  they tailored an incredible and creative alternative menu. we were fortunate enough to sit at the chef's table, which was awesome. the one downside is that you hear the same speech yelling over the noise on repeat as each group comes into the kitchen. if i go again, i will probably do without the wine pairing. it was interesting and the wines were very good, but it was a little fast paced for me and i might have more enjoyed a glass or two of my choosing at my own pace. that is the risk you run though, and it was probably better to go allin on the experience for our first visit."
1449,Melinda Q.,1130,5,6/23/18,"my friends and i flew to chicago from la just to dine at alinea and it did not disappoint. i fell in love with their concept pretty much at hello. i am inclined to visual art and alinea stimulates all of my senses to the max, especially with their visual presentation. the whole hour experience was filled with the unexpected, interactiveness and whimsy throughout. the food was executed beautifully, creatively and deliciously. there were three wine pairing tiers tier  is the most expensive you can choose from as an addon to your dinner experience  we chose the tier  at  per person and it did not disappoint. if you can get a seating in the gallery then i recommend doing so. i do not want to give any more spoiler alerts here because if anyone is considering a visit, then you should let it be a surprise. what i will say is that this is the only star michelin restaurant i have visited that will garner a return, again and again."
1450,Sean O.,1130,5,6/22/18,"what is the definition of perfection in culinary? this will differ from person to person, but for me and the travels around the world, dining at many different restaurants, the answeris alinea in chicago. you can read the full and updated review at the wine dine and play blog. fourteenÄã courses, from the scallops with fourteen textures, rabbit, duck with plate garnish tasting, ginger tasting course, the tokyo inspiration, vealÄã cheeks, a black truffle ravioli and to finish for one of the many desserts, a pte sucre. service was perfect, the wines pairedÄã with each course were right on spot and chef bigale's presentation and professionalism exceeded all expectation. alinea is  michelin star restaurantÄã and rated as one of the best in the world."
1451,Jordan W.,1130,5,10/6/17,"wow. my boyfriend and i had an unforgettable experience at alinea. he had just been promoted and this was the way he wanted to celebrate. we booked the salon menu on the day reservations opened up. everything was sold out within  hours. we enjoyed about  full courses with additional amouse bouche with every other course. the standouts, in my opinion, was the veal dish, the black truffle potato salad made table side and the seabass with coconut. when you see  courses listed, they are counting the small bites as part of that. our servers made us feel totally comfortable and had a great way of reading the table. my boyfriend and i made jokes about the word search and they were able to tell we were not wanting or expecting stiff service. we had previously dined at a  michelin star restaurant and it was white glove service and i felt like i was not allowed to breathe, but that is not the way it was at alinea which by all standards is one of the top restaurants in the country. as someone who has previously served in fine dining, i was amazed at the silent communication between the staff and the kitchen. i could not see them ring in any orders and had no way how they knew when exactly to bring out the next course. it was truly like watching choreography. my boyfriend did not want to drink and i asked for a glass of dry white and they poured one for me. expecting sticker shock at check out, it was actually only  a glass which was better than i was expecting. having seen chef's table and stalked their tagged pictures on instagram, a little of the magic was gone as i knew what to expect. i would recommend to stay away from social media so you can truly be immersed in your experience. we have participated in many chef's tasting menus and i will say alinea is the only one i would go to again."
1452,Megan K.,1130,5,7/24/17,"i have wanted to dine at alinea for...ever? finally my time came. my friend got us a table in the salon for my birthday and it was certainly everything i had hoped it would be. i will preface by saying most find me to be picky, in the sense that i am typically very skeptical when it comes to highly rated places. i have been duped far too many times. but alinea is the real deal. we arrived on a rainy friday evening and the hostess pushed back the doors. it was like being led into some culinary fantasy. every detail was meticulously planned and i cannot choose a favorite course. the savory oreo was pure sin, black truffle , pumpernickel, and guyere cheese. the caviar taco was genius. the short rib was so smoky and sweet. and of course dessert was terribly whimsical and fun. our waiter was delightful and the atmosphere was not stuffy in the least. the other couples in the salon were interactive and we had a lot of fun. i will say, if you are not much of a drinker, you will be drunk when you leave based on the wine pairing. they are definitely generous. i also felt that there could have been a bit more time between courses but i understand they want to accommodate as many patrons as they can. overall, it was wonderful!"
1453,Ksenja T.,1130,5,4/4/17,"three michelin stars.  in the world world's  best, . we made our reservation  months in advance for the gallery. after spending a small fortune ahead of time, we were more than intrigued to see if alinea would live up to the hype andor compare to other michelin restaurants of this caliber. pros newly renovated interior, still intimate yet simple. elements of surpriseshow. staff brad, miguel, everyone was amazing. attentive to allergies. experiencing the alinea kitchen very smart idea. drink pairings not mandatory for the whole table if one person opts for it.  the iconic taffy helium balloon and grand finale dessert were everything we had anticipated, and more. seriously mindblown. the number of desserts in the tasting menuperfect for me as it is my favorite course. thai inspired dish outstanding. my one point of contention we had the  pm seating. i personally felt as though the pace of the courses went very fast. by the end of the more savory courses, i felt overwhelmed as the food was quite decadent ie. black truffle mousse, caviar, lobster, more black truffle sandwich, wagyu beef, bone marrow, mushroom. i am surprised to read that anyone would leave alinea hungry because this to me seems impossible. the staff, however, were very gracious and we stayed for as long as we wanted."
1454,Robin D.,1130,3,11/26/16,"i have been wanting to check this place out for a few years now. it has been ranked as one of the top restaurants in the world so we decided to celebrate our th anniversary here. my rating for this place comes with highly critical expectations and rightfully so. i have been to charlie trotters, tru,  grams, duomo sicily, europea montreal and other ultra fine dining places here and abroad and i honestly cannot say that alinea takes the top spot in my dining list. if your exposure to this dining category is minimal to none, you might say that this is the best dining experience ever. otherwise, you might think it would be at par to some, better than other or even worse than some. i had a good experience not a wow experience. we paid  pp without drinks and we were seated on the second floor. the moment i sat down, against the wall i felt the seat was a bit low and uncomfortable. as minor as this is, it sets the tone for rest of your dining experience. troutcoconutpassion fruit  interesting scallopnori  super yum sanma fish  i am a seafood lover and this one i did not consume, it just did not taste right. the presentation was superb. ciderorangemaple...  good pork belly  fantastic but anyone can make this dish taste good. pearpaprikajamon  i already forgot this mastic concorde  if this is the one with the foie grois then it was outstanding black truffle gruyere  this one was truly divine wagyu  so so so good! short rib  delish desserts  well done although the servings were very small, i thought it was enough. i am glad we did not order the soup that was the special for the day  usd for a bowl of soup because at the end of meal, i could not even finish my dessert service is good to very good. we had some dietary restrictions against refined sugar and the email communication was very efficient. just like most places that charge a lot, it can be a bit pretentious. i have to say that the service was more casual than refined elegance. there were a few flaws like they refilled my sparkling water with flat water. they tried to take my dish even when i was not done twice. we mentioned our anniversary in our email and there was no acknowledgement of it in any way shape or form. a bit disappointing. all in all it was a good experience. was it worth the money? sure. would i recommend it? absolutely! would i be back? not unless someone else is paying the bill."
1455,Char L.,1130,5,11/9/16,"what could i say that has not been said already? surprised throughout the meal as the chef only have  or  words on the menu for the courses. favorite courses of the night were the black truffle toast and rock dessert. just wow. it is also white truffle season when we went, so for a  charge per person, we got potatoes with white truffle shavings. so damn good. it is also quiet the presentation. i think our bowl of potatoes was served on top of a stack of  plates. service was fantastic, as one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. what was fun was that the waiters were super friendly and would crack a joke or chit chat with you if you are cool with it."
1456,David E.,1130,5,11/3/16,"after watching chef's table on netflix, i thought i would find myself eating at alinea only in my dreams. fortunately the stars aligned, and me and some friends squeezed alinea, a byumsu football game, and an eagleslions game into a   day trip from utah. as much as i love football, alinea was the highlight of the trip and truly a culinary experience of a lifetime. many reviews offer a detailed playbyplay of the evening, but i would recommend, do not read the details!. alinea is not just a meal, it is an experience. chef achatz and his amazingly creative staff have designed an experience around their food. there are tricks and turns, a few jokes, and some killer food. the element of surprise is half the fun, so do not lessen the experience by knowing every minute detail of your meal before you arrive. our first course was ice. there were five small glasses, set in a chunk of ice. in the cups . black truffle mousse, with grated black truffle , . chunks of king crab in a crab vinaigrette, . herbs from chef achatz own garden, . osetra caviar, . egg yolk custard. we were then given toast points, and encouraged to mix each of the ingredients on the toast to create our own taste combinations. each little cup held a bit of culinary perfection, and mixed together in different ways, each bite was a new experience. this dish is probably the single most memorable dish i have ever eaten. amazing! we sat at the kitchen table, which is a glass contained dining room with with full view of alinea's kitchen. it was simply amazing to watch chef achatz work in his star michelin kitchen. there had to have been  staff members in the kitchen, yet is was crazy quiet and orderly the entire evening. if you can swing the cost of the kitchen, do it! the cost is ridiculous, but so is the cost of the entry level dining option  and for me being in the kitchen made the night. it was also a nice bonus to have chef achatz join us personally to add the finishing touch to the dessert grand finale. we do not drink, so we added the nonalcoholic drink pairing  which i would not recommend. some strange concoctions that did not enhance the food. not worth it... as for details, i will say no more. the food is amazing, the experience is even more amazing. my recommendation would be go!! but, skip some reviews and let alinea surprise you."
1457,Donald B.,1130,2,10/4/16,"not impressed with the alinea .. the last time i dined was , that was more real with soul. now it seems all about ego, tricks, and ponies. each dish i had in the past was better than the next, black truffle explosion, bison and pine. if something did not work it was not because it was not good, it was my personal taste. . is over priced, stuffy, messy, and over the top. it is not real food."
1458,Eugenia L.,1130,5,10/4/16,"the most amazing dining experience in my life. i have been wanting to go here for years and finally made a trip to chicago for one night just to go here! tons of spoilers so if you want to be surprised skip this review! i know the menu changes but just a disclaimer! we attended the gallery tasting which consisted of  courses. this is the middle tasting menu. communal when we first arrived we were seated in a huge communal table with different items in little glasses that were in an ice block. tables are separated after the next course. the items in each glass were truffle mousse, king crab, herb salad, osetra caviar, and an egg custard. they told us to wait until everyone was seated. fyi this is why you need to be on time, everyone is waiting on you if you are late!! do not be that guy or girl!! once everyone is seated they gave everyone toasted brioche and told us to start digging in! shakerroll for the next part we were asked to leave our belongings at our seats while we moved to the kitchen to get our next courses. they made an alcoholic drink gin, tomato, chartreuse in front of us with a little roll of cucumber, feta, and caper leaves. since i told gen earlier i did not drink they made me a special non alcoholic drink with ginger and cucumber that was so yummy! crunopaper diver scallops are pureed and then formed into these paper looking things! a delicious corn broth is poured over it to rehydrate the paper looking things which then turns into a scallop noodle. omg. this was the most amazing dish ever. so unique, so full of flavor. the crunch part was a nori roll that was filled with scallop mousse. delicious. i wan't these packed up in snack bags! contrastsangreswirl this course consisted of contrast tomato soup, freeze dried watermelon, parmesan, sangre green peanut, iberico jelly, apple jelly, sherry foam, and swirl apple, yuzu, lemon verbena! the smokey thing coming out had strong scents of yuzu infusing the air and table while we ate these dishes! amazing! i hate tomatoes and i actually liked the soup, so many interesting and different flavors! spectrum a big plate comes out with what looks like a painted fish! the main item is a mackerel with an avocado sauce, aji amarillo sauce, and katsuobushi sauce. there is also a potato stuffed pepper, a radish salad, and avocado. i loved mixing pieces of the fish with all the other sides. such a tasty dish that just looked so fun! yellow this came in a weird silicon bowl that fit your hand! this dish was pork belly in curry with banana. the pork belly and the sauce were amazing! there were also sliced fennel on top for that extra texture. the pork belly was so good and was cooked perfectly. the sauce was not a typical curry, it had a sour note to it that made it extra special! toast um yum. this is what they called their version of a grilled cheese! this was a piece of pumpernickel toast with gruyere cheese and black truffles . this was so good and so rich and so filling! i cannot even express in words the taste explosion in my mouth! petalglass i wish this course came earlier because i love mushrooms but i was getting so full! this was maitake mushrooms,apsang souchong  black tea, with blueberry paper. if you love mushrooms you will love love this. so so good and the blueberry paper added a sour element and just made it just that much better! the petal was onion, purple allium, and black pepper. bone this dish was one of my favorites of the whole night! a piece of wagyu on top of a crispy rice square seasoned with myoga type of ginger. this was just such an interesting and surprisingly good course! it kind of reminded me of a savory rice crispy!! who does not like a savory rice crispy?! cloche as they put the bowl down and lifted the cover, all sorts of aromas hits you! i think it was anise and clove. the bowl contained tender short rib pieces, lentils omg so good, and champagne soaked grapes. the short ribs and lentils were so freaking good. i kept going back for the lentils though!! nostalgia wow! i was stuffed an manged to eat the whole thing. this had all sort of textures going on with bubble gum, cake, strawberry, and cherry flavors! this also came with a banana helium balloon that actually floated! everything in this dessert was so fun, unique, different, and yummy! paint all of a sudden we see people taking down the paintings on the ceiling and putting them on our table. the the lights go off and music starts playing. then different people are coming by the tables painting and spreading all these different things on the painting. then at the the end they smash a freeze dried sort of ice cream thing and bam! dessert is served! gold the last item is a gold flake wrapped candy with sesame, brown butter, and feuilletine praline flavor. i was happy. worth every penny. whew i am done!"
1459,Adrienne H.,1130,5,9/2/16,"alinea was part of my surprise birthday weekend to chicago, and it was definitely the highlight of the trip. alinea recently transformed their dining experience with a new menu and interior decor. i was not able to visit prerenovation, so i cannot compare, but the new . menu was ridiculously delightful. they excel at incorporating all senses, and the performance aspect was far above my other michelin star experiences. the food itself was also very good and in my top three. we had the upstairs salon menu, which was the shortest of the menu options. with  complex courses, i left thoroughly satisfied. i can only imagine what the gallery or kitchen table menus must be like. a future trip for sure! some highlights course  ice  served in a bowl made of ice. the unique combination and complex flavors made this one of the more memorable courses of the night. who would have thought banana sorbet, macadamia, coconut, and prawn tasted so good together? course  contrast, sparrowgrass, swirl  a visual and olfactory delight. the swirl dish released a strong yuzuscented fog that cascaded over the bowl. the contrast was my favorite of the three because of the various textures  olive oil gummies, lavender gel, tomato, watermelon, and parmesan custard. party in my mouth! course  glass & petal  my favorite savory course. beautiful plating, thoughtful presentation of onion within itself, and morels! the glass dish had glasslike shards made from blueberry and lapsang souchong tea. underneath were morels covered in foie gras sauce, with bits of a pickled green. so good. course  toast  shaved black truffle finger sandwiches!! we are talking pumpernickel toast, layered with gruyere cream, and copious amounts of truffle . a lot of times, black truffle is dried out and lacking in flavor. this was not one of the those times. heaven. course  nostalgia  i was excited to see the iconic helium balloons had stayed on from the previous menu, though now in strawberry taffy flavor. the table next to us actually lost a balloon to the ceiling. i wish i got a snap of the waiter standing on a chair and poking at the balloon! the plated part of the course was a dark chocolate square with caramelized fennel ice cream inside, served on an amazing lemon white chocolate cookie over sabayon sauce. course  paint  this was like a preplated version of their table top paint show. cherry, white chocolate, orange bourbon, coffee, and pistachio flavors made for an insane flavor explosion. truly one of the the best desserts i have ever had. my sweet tooth can die happy now. other than a few forgettable dishes, the food was remarkable in its own right. the creativity was evident in every course and flavor combinations consistently surprised me. the service was on point, but laidback at the same time. this was finesse without the stuffiness. timing was a little off, and we did have moments where we sat for more than a few minutes over an empty table. total dining time was just under three hours. i was a bit surprised at the lack of any extra courses, bread, or mignardises with the check. perhaps that is only for the longer meal options. not a big deal though. this was in my top three dining experiences, and i would not hesitate to go back."
1460,Michael H.,1130,5,7/22/16,"this was an amazing wonderful experience, certainly much more than just another great meal. more to follow soon, when i have had time to sleep on it. dining at alinea is an elaborate affair, so let me elaborate just what it was that we ate and drank osetra caviar, king crab, and condiments presented in glass in wells in a large block of ice.  krug clos du mesnil champagne, france  cucumber, feta, caper leaf gin, green tomato, chartreuse scallop, corn, butter shio kombu, nori  domaine laroche les clos chablis grand cru  sweet potato curry yolks collet demisec champagne, france nv  white asparagus  lychee  lily bulb our bowl filled with citrus was set to release a great quantity of smoky mist, as solid carbon dioxide sublimated to vapor and poured out onto the table, then down to the floor. icefish  daisy mandarin  radish  kiedrich grafenberg riesling splese, robert weil, rheingau, germany  morel  blueberry  lapsang souchong onion, purple allium, black pepper  shiraz, henschke, mt edelstone, south australia gruyre  black truffle  pumpernickel a volcanic bowl was placed on the table, containing aromatics, such as cinnamon and star anise, and set alight something was presented on volcanic platter . . . . veal cheek  chamomile  melon wagyu  rice  myoga  the restaurant's name comes from a variant name of the pilcrow, [  ] a typographical mark used to indicate individual paragraphs. the name alinea comes from latin, a lineƒÅ, meaning off the line. please do not bring your small children or babies, this is not the right place for them."
1461,Paul F H.,1130,5,6/24/16,"ok, to start with, my review is of the old alinea since i am catching up with all the places i have eaten at over the last few years. if you need a review of the most recent iteration of alinea you can skip mine and go on to the next one. but i think my observations will still have merit since as far as i can tell the aim of the restaurant has not changed  and that is to serve a meal that is literally a work of art. we were served eighteen courses that progressed from savory to sweet. the size of the circle on the menu indicated the size of the portion from a single bite to a larger plate. some were alinea classics  black truffle explosion, and hot potatocold potato with black truffle , others were seasonal and unique to out visit. alinea was a bit pretentious and kind of full of itself but this did not negate the creativity and flavor of the food. servers and sommelier were arrogant and not interested in engaging in any conversation about the food or wine, but yet they were highly professional and efficient. the wine pairing was very good but i have had better at a couple of other highly rated restaurants. still, all in all, alinea was one of the most significant dining experiences of my life. was it the best food or service ever? probably not. was it the most creative and artistic meal i have ever eaten? without a doubt the answer is yes."
1462,Stephanie T.,1130,5,6/10/16,"at what other restaurant can you blow an edible balloon, have a campfire lit on your table, have your centerpiece turned into a delicious broth, and have an edible piece of art masterfully drawn on your table? the answer is nowhere. my boyfriend and i came here for our graduation dinner after making a reservation a month in advance and the experience was definitely worth the wait! the experience was truly unforgettable and full of surprises and unique plating unparalleled anywhere.  st dish steelhead with english pea and chamomile steam. it was light, airy and the perfect start to the meal.  nd dish the skate with brown butter and lemon, which we ate in one delicious buttery meltinyour mouth bite. again, fresh and perfect for spring.  rd dish the first surprise of the night graffiti with orange carrot juice spray painted onto the dishes, served on a slab of concrete. i have never had a waiter spray paint my plate before!  th dish surf clam soup that you drink from a metal straw straight from the plate, surrounded by delicate small bites that paired perfectly with the salty broth.  th dish another surprise! we had been marveling at the strange light hanging above our table during the first  dishes, only to have our waiter take it down and mix it into a delicious darjeeling broth! the broth then was poured on top of egg plant and mustard seeds for a slightly more sour dish.  th dish three bites blue crab, tamarind caramel, and siam sunray ice. each was a great refreshing palate cleanser for the middle of the meal.  th dish angelfish jaw street food! this was probably my favorite. it was crispy with a delicious sauce served atop a chinese newspaper.  th dish let there be fire! percebes tororo kombo with smoked foie gras and hamachi to roast over the fire. the foie gras was rich and the hamachi fresh! such a fun interactive dish!  th dish goose barnacles! because... why not?  th dish guess what was hidden in the fire? pork belly and parsnip! great grilled flavor and char on both.  th dish another one of my favorites hot potato, cold potato with black truffles ! creamy potatoes with amazing truffle flavor.  th dish rabbit with morels served on moss and real california redwood!  th dish beginning of the desserts believe it or not chocolate ice cream in a glass bowl! so crazy for being completely crystal clear.  th dish cheesecake with matcha, berries, and hibiscus. great offset of flavors between the matcha and the berries.  th dish the famous green apple balloon with helium inside. delicious, but messy. but seriously, where else can you eat a balloon?  th dish the art. they brought out all the ingredients in separate little bowls first. complete with fresh passionfruit, sauces, and gummies. but the presentation was the true grand finale. the waiter created art right on our table with all of the ingredients thrown onto the canvas with flair. each were a new bite to try and each person got one of each ingredient so no one was left out. overall, amazing presentation, such a fun and exciting and outofthisworld meal. definitely worth going to for the experience. you will not be disappointed."
1463,Katherine H.,1130,5,6/5/16,the most amazing meal i will probably ever have. completely worth it grant achatz is a genius and creates such an innovative dining experience. my favorite was the black truffle explosion.
1464,Veronica P.,1130,4,3/27/16,"alinea is on the list of must eat places for any foodie, and i certainly was no different. the restaurant stopped taking reservations over the phone several years ago. now, they sell tickets, which go on sale the month prior. their reasoning was that it was taking two full time employees to answer the phones for reservations, and to make their reservations more transparent as anybody could see their schedule. getting the preferred date and time is somewhat akin to winning the lottery. some say that getting the earliest reservation possible is the way to go, that way you do not see what is coming as servers bring dishes to neighboring tables. the restaurant is located in a nondescript gray building on halsted. if it were not for the very small valet parking sign, you would have a hard time finding the restaurant. i was able to reserve a  pm reservation, the earliest available. after being seated, the noticeable things were the centerpiece of rosemary, mint and lemon rind in a pitcher, as well as a lily and shishito pepper hanging from the ceiling. the meal began with an aperitif of a peach juice ball with basil on top of some frozen crumbles. we were instructed to just eat the peach ball first. the next course used the water pitcher in which prosecco was poured into the pitcher then shaken to remove all of the bubbles. this was poured over the frozen crumbles, which was actually frozen alcohol. the dish together was somewhat reminiscent of a bellini. the next course consisted of  small dishes. the first consisted of bread, iberico ham and manchego cheese. the bread was pillowy soft, while the ham and cheese added a salty punch. this was a high class ham and cheese sandwich. the second was a gelatin cube with flavors of guindilla de ibarra a type of chili pepper, anchovy and olive. once again, this dish had a strong salty component to it. this was not one of my favorites. the last dish consisted of paprika, chili and garlic. despite the strong flavor profiles of the ingredients, the taste was somewhat subdued and underwhelming. the next course was a soup. inside of the bowl, was a fennel tea with tapioca pearls and a gazpacho foam made of tomatoes and strawberries. we were given a metal boba straw to drink the soup. on the rim of the dish was a strawberry, tomato, basil, pumpernickel and burrata cheese. the soup was very refreshing and fun. on the rim of the dish, the tomato tasted like a strawberry, and the strawberry tasted like a tomato. the next dish was served in a bowl that looked like a she will that was sitting in another bowl with dry ice. the dry ice enveloped the she will looking dish with a thick fog which contained arctic char roe, peas, olive oil and chamomile. the salty theme continued with the roe, but was mellowed with the peas and olive oil. the next dish was a salad served on a slab of concrete. the salad consisted of white and green asparagus, fava beans, black truffles and a carrot dressing that was spray painted over the salad. the asparagus and fava beans were nice and firm, the black truffles adding some earthiness while the carrot dressing added a hint of sweetness. this was a nicely balanced, creative and fun. the hanging squash blossom and chile were also brought into play. there was a black kettle and charcoal that were set on fire, but this was the beginning of the following course. there were several components to the dish. there corn with uni butter and togarashi ice fish cracker with smoked hamachi tartar and kombu seaweed. lastly, on a piece of driftwood adorned with seaweed were goose barnacles. on the rosemary was unagi with umeboshi pickled plum, brown sugar and soy glaze. the charcoal was yakitori chicken legs wrapped in kombu and nori. another piece of charcoal was daikon. the shishito pepper had been grilled. the lilly flower was served raw. a dashi was poured over the entire dish, which had been kept warm over the fire. next was the signature hot potatocold potato. the dish is served in a wax bowl with a pin holding a black truffle hot potato. by pulling out the pin, the hot potato is dropped into cold truffle and potato soup. the interplay between temperature and texture makes this a simply wonderful, and stunning dish. the next dish brought a large vase filled with olive brances with pieces of oily, cottony fluffy olive bread. the remainder of the dish included black grapes, green and black olives, lamb loin and tenderloin, lamb sausage, greek yogurt sauce and lamb jus. the bread was meant to use to sop up the sauces. the lamb was perfectly cooked with just a hint of gaminess but the brine of the olvies was a little too strong for my taste. the parade of desserts then started."
1465,Amelia M.,1130,4,3/27/16,"i really want to give this place a  stars, but my experience was not the best. went to chicago for a long weekend trip, and decided to come here to celebrate end of exams. we reserved  weeks before and paid in advance online. we were presented with a  course meal, some of my favourites included the lobster, black truffle , duck, and milk chocolate. the lobster dish included curry, earl grey, and grapefruit. the duck dish was presented  ways including foie gras. the black truffle was presented like a dumpling, and as you bite into it the richness of the truffle and parmesan cheese ooozes out. the milk chocolate finale was a piece of artwork made in front of us, consisting of a centerpiece of chocolate, with splashes of violet puree, hazelnut, and cream on the side. i was not a big fan of the lily bulb, and rhubarb. the lily bulb was way to sour for my taste, i believe it was included as a palette cleanser but nevertheless, i did not enjoy it. the rhubarb consisted of celery root, celery branch, and licorice, and was a miss. overall, the presentation, creativity, and attention to detail in all of the dishes are spectacular. definitely a  on that end. however, the taste of the plates were a hit or miss. in my opinion, there is definitely a greater emphasis on the presentation of the food versus the actual taste. the waiterswaitresses that we encountered seemed a bit pretentious. i felt like we were constantly being pushed to finish our dishes so they can serve the next dish, and this definitely detracted from the overall dining experience. only thing i liked was when we left the restaurant, the doorman called us a cab. i would give the overall service a .. overall verdict superb presentation of the dishes, subpar service. would not recommend. i am sure there are comparable restaurants in the chicago dining scene with better service."
1466,Grace H.,1130,3,1/13/16,"after wanting to eat at alinea for the longest time, i finally made it to there for my th birthday!! i was super excited and soooo happy i was able to get a reservation. i was literally checking every single day and pretty much gave up!! but i ended up being able to share a table with  other lovely ladies, so i was stoked!!. it was also my first time visiting chicago, which i had heard great things about. honestly, i probably would have made a trip to chicago just for alinea, but good thing i did not. i was not impressed. maybe even disappointed given the hype and excitement. i have eaten at six  michelinstar restaurants french laundry, joel robuchon, benu, jeangeorges, & grace, and alinea unfortunately was the only one that truly let me down ' i am not going to give restaurants  just because everyone else or food critics or whoever thought so. so this is just my honest, humble opinion.  okay, so if i were to rate alinea for presentation and creativity. sure, it probably is the best of the best, especially if you go back a few years ago, i feel not that many restaurants were on the same level. however, times have changed, other chefs have learned to master the art of presentation and innovative food.  taste of the food was decent is all that i can describe. in fact the only dish i really really enjoyed was the potato puree with black truffle . nothing too crazy, but ooh so flavorful. it left me wanting more. i cannot really say that for any of the other things i ate. uni corn i remember was good too.  maybe this is getting too much into personal tastepreference, but too much use of strong flavored pickled garnishes that took away from the actual taste of the main dish. i thought fresh and good quality ingredients should not be overpowered. at first i tried to eat everything on the plate since i am pretty sure the chef planned each & every item on there with an intention. but towards the end, i realized it was making my meal less enjoyable so i stopped eating them.  i loveeeeeeeeeee dessert, so even after all this, i was still hoping dessert could win me over. it did not. okay, maybe my own fault for already having seen pictures, but as artistic and fun as it was. i did not care for the actual eating part of the dessert...now this makes me really really sad. i am usually the one who is eating me and my dining companion's share of dessert, cleaning off the plate...the dessert was aokay. service was great no complaints. presentation was mostly wonderful minus the barnacles and olive oil cake inside the plant i thought was a bit too much lol. taste was honestly a let down, considering alinea is supposed to be one of the world's best restaurants. for a hefty  per person, i do not want just a food show, i expect all my food to be freaking delicious too!! maybe my palate just is not eclectic enough for alinea??? maybe they are trying too hard to be weirddifferent?? ahhh i do not know...but entire meal no steaklobsterduckquailshrimpscallopscaviarfoie graspasta...felt like something was missing...like a main entree?? haha...me and my bf both felt the meal did not feel complete. one time experience...okay...but really no need to ever go back. i went to eat at grace the next day. honestly, i would pick grace over alinea."

1468,Dan M.,1130,5,10/6/15,"alinea is more than a meal it is a dining experience. as soon as you walk in the door you enter another world where art and world come together in perfect unison. a meal at alinea is one of those rare meals that will inspire your mind and stick with you for a life time. alinea is best experienced when you know as little as possible so the experience can be truly personal. avoid spoilers, therefore stop reading if you want to make the best of your night. as soon as you walk in the door the tone for the entire experience is set by a red lit hallway that tappers at the end. as you move down the hall a large sliding door automatically opens, ushering you into another world. you walk in the door and immediately you are greeted by a smiling man in a suit. he welcomes you with instructions to hang out near the glass wall and study the kitchen. you stand there, entranced by the eerily quiet but busy kitchen. the man in the suit says it is time to move to the table. over the table a shishito pepper and lilly hang, creating a shadow that resembles a hummingbird. in the center of the table sits a carafe containing mint, rosemary, and orange peel. the man in the suit pours sparkling wine into the carafe as part of the first drink pairing. peach with basil and murray river salt is a frozen ball containing peach juice that bursts into sweet liquidy goodness when places in your mouth. suddenly the man in the suit reaches over and pours the contents of the carafe over the frozen crystals the peach orb had been sitting on. there is a frozen cocktail staring you in the face, uncertain but containing freeze dried avino cava reserva penedes, pacharan sierra de orduna, rhine hall apple brandy. the second course, bites inspired by spanish tapas. to you they seem like something out of science fiction. an entire meal in one bite! bite , bocadillo with bread, jamon iberico, manchego! bite , gilda with guindilla de ibarra, anchovy, olive! bite , patatas bravas with paprika, chile, garlic enter stage left, dish number , strawberry with tomato, pumpernickel, burrata. the dish looks like a simple tomato, strawberry, some bread crumbs, and some cheese. at a glance, you would be wrong. both the strawberry and tomato are actually gels. the strawberry tastes like a tomato and the tomato tastes like a strawberry. your mind is blown apart from the inside out. truly innovative and really makes you think about your tendency to eat with your eyes first. a smoking fourth dish slams down on the table like some kind of fusion between halloween and spring time. the smell of chamomile and flowers hits you in the face. the man in the suit says char roe with english pea, olive oil, chamomile. at the bottom of the bowl there are several gels including jalapeno and some roe. each element was interesting on its own but when mixed paired flawlessly. dish number five, graffiti consists of matsutake and maitake mushrooms served on concrete slabs. the dish is tagged with parsley puree. to you, the street art inspiration has been made clear. never before has a mushroom tasted so good. the sixth course is comprised of several elements. unagi with pickled plum, white sesame corn with uni, nori, togarashi tororo kombu with hamachi, ice fish cracker percebes with smoke, seawater, ash the last element is served on a piece of driftwood covered in seaweed. the only thing you are instructed to eat is the four tiny barnacles. each part of the course brings forward sharp images of the salty sea. you suddenly realize the next dish had been sitting in front of you all along in the flames. the chicken and daikon were wrapped in seaweed roasting in the fire. it was unwrapped and prepared at the table by the man in the suit. the sauce was in the tea kettle and was poured over the course. a tiny white orb arrives at the table. the man in the suit says its name is, hot potato with cold potato, black truffle , and butter. this dish was time sensitive with both cold and hot elements. the pin was pulled out of the dish, dropping the cold potato into the hot butter. incredible mouth feel of contrasting hot and cold elements. next a vase of bay leaves is placed on the table with olive cake with extra virgin olive oil, black pepper sitting a top the leaves. it is served with lamb with caper leaf, grapes, olives. this dish was paired with oliver cake, which made for perfect sauce enjoyment. one of the last dishes, as your night winds down, parsnip with honey truffle , vanilla, orange paired sweet and savory elements perfectly. you never will look at a parsnip the same again. a tart lemon balloon arrives at the table. it is made of lemon candy and filled with helium. you suck the helium out of the candy and devour the lemon sweet goodness. for the grand finale, tropical fruit. this dish was plated directly on the table with a variety of sauces all spice, mango, rum. you leave but cannot seem to shake the experience, numb."
1469,Michael H.,1130,5,8/7/15,"best meal of my life. i ate at the french laundry in  when chef achatz was still working there, i have eaten at jean georges and other fine establishments. alinea topped all of them. the service is more perfect than words can convey. the food is delicious and like nothing you have eaten before. surprising, fun, exciting. by the  way point i had lost the ability to form coherent sentences, my mind was reeling with flavour and delight. it was over all too soon and my girlfriend and i stayed up for and hour and a half after taking notes so we could remember what happened and relish the evening. a couple of interesting notes... since you pay ahead of time, if you do not opt for wine, no money changes hands during the evening and that was a very nice comfortable experience. one fewer thing to distract us from enjoyment. coffee or tea at the end is included and was amazing and i do not normally drink coffee. there were a couple of courses that had a heavy japanese influence. in the past i considered traveling to japan to try the food. that would have cost several thousand dollars. now i am thinking i will save that money and just come back to chicago and try alinea. chef achatz, you have saved me a great deal of money here and i can now justify coming back. this makes me very happy. i love thai curries and make them myself. one of the courses involved a single bite dish that was a green curry. in that one bite it tasted like the best bowl of green curry with crab in this case that i have ever had. this was very much a willy wonka moment. one of the dishes that involved black truffle was by far the best use of black truffle i have ever eaten. this was from the grafiti course. i look forward to going back some day. we did not go away hungry. our taxi was waiting for us when we got back to the real world outside."
1470,Shelly P.,1130,4,11/4/18,great place to enjoy fine dining with your loved ones. customer service was superb. must try the edible balloons !
1471,Ari P.,1130,5,11/1/18,"a once in a lifetime experience that i am no lucky enough to have been two twice. i was honestly a bit worried that dishes from my last visit  years ago would be repeated not that they were bad at all, but rather so creative i thought they were signatures. the only repeat was the now famous dessert balloon . i do not want to share too much and spoil the fun surprises at dinner. alinea is a world class restaurant that keeps getting better. this is not a restaurant where technique is a gimmick it easily could go that way but chef grant who was there making sure things were as they should be for dinner on a monday night, and nice enough to wish my brother good luck on a new endeavor. amazingly the food was delicious and the experimental techniques and environment only support it wagyu rossini with rossini anyone?. it used to be like the meal was a show and now it feels like an adventure. watch chefs table and read life on the line before you go! only complaints are that the lucite table top was a bit cracked and server told us it was vintage."
1472,Eric F.,1130,5,10/30/18,"i find alinea a tough restaurant to review. my experience there was a mixture of revelation and disappointment, but i am giving it a reluctant five stars because overall it was a very memorable experience. alinea is a bucket list restaurant. a trip down alice's rabbit hole. it is expensive very expensive and difficult to get a reservation. upon being seated we were served an amuse bouche, in the form of a little clay pot filled with frozen snow of some kind, fish roe, and some edible flowers and herbs. was it delicious? not really, but it was interesting. i will not go over every course in detail. some were very delicious, some were slightly disappointing. there were some theatrical surprises that were definitely brilliant, like when liquid nitrogen is poured over the centrepiece of oranges and you are completely engulfed in a fog of citrusy smoke while eating some orangeshaped bites on a glowing plate, filled with an intense cloveflavoured liqueur. it is an almost overwhelmingly intense sensory experience that is beyond simple categories like delicious. i am not sure if it was delicious. it was intense, nostalgic and... what is the right word? beautiful. some of the dishes presented flavours i had never experienced before. i could almost feel my brain creating new neural pathways as it tried to grapple with them. i even had vivid flavour flashbacks the next day  something i have never experienced before the memory of redolent juniper smoke, the rich umami of bouillabaisse with it is reconstituted langoustine noodle. if i could do it all over again i would have skipped the wine pairings and gone for more courses. the wine was good, but was actually overkill for the small courses a full glass with every course. i sometimes felt rushed to finish the wine before the next course arrived and felt a bit tipsy by the end of the meal. then of course there is the edible helium balloon . it is hard to give a meal that ends with an edible balloon less than five stars, even though there were some bumps and disappointments along the way."
1473,Linda T.,1130,4,10/13/18,"i was so shocked we were able to get last minute reservations to alinea during my visit this past weekend! they take reservation online only and you basically purchase tickets at a specific time and date. first day looking, everything was all full, so i kept checking daily and something actually opened up. the reservations are not refundable so if you get a reservation, you are going! we sat in the salon upstairs and had about  courses throughout the night. our servers were very attentive and would explain each dish. they use a lot of aromatics and visual platings to stimulate tastes and accentuate each course. one of my favorite was this scallop noodles in curry sauce..the texture of the noodles were amazing since it is made of scallops! the sauce and the overall taste was perfect. the most anticipated part was the last course, which is a helium green apple taffy balloon ! everything is edible, even the string. it is super sticky and a lot of people in the room got the balloon stuck to their hair or glasses, so be careful. overall a great experience with unique twists and turns. service and ambiance are amazing. im so happy to at least have the opportunity to try it once! top  restaurant in the world...# this year, but was once #! amazing!"
1474,Stephy L.,1130,4,9/18/18,"what a once in a life time experience. i can understand why it received  michelin stars and is rated within the best  restaurants in the world! although i heard that past menus since they change their menus every so often was way better than what i had. reservations are hard to come by, make sure you read when you can sign up for reservations. i believe it is every th of the month at like am or some early time depending on what time zone you are in, that you can reserve for the next month or two. i booked it right when it came out and since i was going on a holiday weekend, it sold out instantly. i was lucky enough to get my hands on a pm reservation though. we did the cheaper tier since there are two prices. the more costly tier allows you to sit at the chefs table and has more display artwork with the food. it is nice that you prepaid for it so you go there and simply enjoy. although we added  wine glasses and a wine pairing to our bill since we did not book that beforehand. everything is a surprise. all we are given is this wordsearch on the table that has part of what we are eating on it. it was hard not glancing at other people's tables to see what they were having. each item came out and each was delicious and different from anything we had before. the food kept surprising us. at one point during dinner, they invited everyone in the room to go downstairs to the kitchen to enjoy a bite and drink, which i thought was unique and fantastic. in the kitchen, it was cool to see them mass make plates and to absorb everything in. once our bite was over, we went back upstairs to continue our dinner. i do not want to spoil the menu but the dessert was aboslutely amazing. that banana looked so real and it was sooooooooo good. the instagram photos that you normally see is the candy balloon . it is difficult to take a photo with it. unfortunately, my boyfriend's balloon deflated when it got to him, but our server was nice to get a new one. but by the time he got a new one, my deflated and we were not able to get a nice photo together with it. we did, however, suck the helium in and our voices were squeaky momentarily. overall, we enjoyed the experience. i think people over hyped it for me that i did not believe it was amaaaaazing like oh my god, but it was definitely an experience. i do not know if i would do it again, maybe in the long future. the price is really decent for a  michelin stars, given that anything in the bay area is at that price already for  star or less."
1475,Ellarey M.,1130,5,9/8/18,"visited alinea in december for my boyfriend's th birthday and it did not disappoint. our visit was full of surprises but also had some of the highlights that i was expecting edible balloon , clear pumpkin pie that i had seen on their instagram page. if i went back, the only change i would make is to do the wine pairing. we did a half bottle of white and a full bottle of red, which i expected to be a more economical choice, but i think it works out the same pricewise. they even gave my boyfriend a birthday champagne drink, which was special and unique. to me, the experience overall was worth the price."
1476,A D.,1130,4,9/1/18,"the service is topnotch and the presentation is impeccable. there needs to be better dessert than the fancier dipping dots ice cream and the sticky balloon but overall, a great experience. i took my dad here for father's day and he was wished as soon as we entered. attention to detail is impressive."
1477,Jennifer S.,1130,5,8/18/18,some tips  you can split the standard wine pairing . this way you will still get some great wine education from the somm without frowning at the bill.  do not try to take a selfie with the edible balloon . it could float toward your face and end up popping. which is actually hilarious for everyone else at the table but maybe not for you.  definitely start talking right after you inhale the helium from the balloon . you will laugh for the next  minutes. guaranteed
1478,Silvia G.,1130,5,7/11/18,"alinea has  well deserved michelin stars and has been on the list of the best restaurants in the us and it surely lives up to the hype! after years of planning, we finally decided to make a reservation just a few weeks prior and were lucky to secure a reservation at the salon nd floor. we had about  courses in  hours and were very full at the end. each one was creative and stimulated all senses. do not expect a traditional steak or lobster here. everything is infused and almost transformed into a unique shape, color or flavor. molecular gastronomy. the taste is good but it is mainly the presentation and the experience that blows your mind and stimulates all five senses. be prepared to be surprised along the way. we had . terrarium avocado and beautiful herbs and jelly on a bed of iceberg. smoked osetra with an edible sunflower . ranina ranina crab, curry, liquid oranges . black squid ink pasta . langoustine paper in a broth . scallop dumpling infused with lavender . clam chowder made in front of you . morel . squab seared with coal . a tube with a pineapplealoe shot . banana split with a green apple balloon . be sure to inhale the helium and say something! the service is great and the menu does change every couple months so everyone's experience will be slightly different. i especially enjoyed a field trip to the kitchen where they showed us a shaker for our cocktails and of course the famous sugar balloon . hands down, the best culinary experience i have ever had!"
1479,Nicki R.,1130,5,7/10/18,"this was such an amazing experience. i loved the mind games the menu plays on you, and the word search menu is unique to alinea. it was fascinating to see the art that goes into making this one of the best restaurants in the world. throughout the dinner the courses were timed perfectly, and i felt like i was watching a show waiting for the next course to arrive. the green apple heliumfilled candy balloon is just as amazing as it sounds. i would have to say the octopus was probably my favorite dish, but it is very hard to say. definitely an experience you cannot get very many places!"
1480,Tara E.,1130,5,7/9/18,"obviously amazing. the best dining experience. the bowl of oranges with the steam, squid ink, mini clear apple pies, green apple dessert balloons not my first time inhaling helium  i will be back soon for sure."
1481,Ilana O.,1130,4,7/1/18,"the place part of what you pay for obviously, is the service, the ambiance, and the overall feel of your special meal. everything is extremely well choreographed, and while i expected it to feel a little pretentiousstuffy, it actually did not really feel that way. i occasionally laughed really loudly sorry, not sorry, and was glad that i did not get any nasty looks directed at me. it almost felt like a communal experience. you could see what other tables were experiencing  from the fire, smoke, lights, tubes and balloons , so you knew what was coming. we also got to take a field trip to the kitchen, which was special. seeing the team work together to prep and plate the food was a treat in it of itself. the taste let me count the number of words on the menu that i do not know osetra, calendula, binchotan. three, okay, so not bad, but the menu does not do the meal justice. i could go through the dishes, but i am sure every meal is differenteveryone has their own opinions and memories associated with different flavors. what i will say is that it was not the most amazing stuff i have ever tasted ever, but it was interesting. interactive. definitely much of it was delicious. i will say though, by the end of the th course, i was getting full. there were at least three dishes that i could not come close to finishing, and i felt bad leaving  of food just sitting there, but one server said that he appreciated me knowing my limits. also, while the green apple balloon tasted good, and was executed well, it mostly ended up popping on my hands, so it ended up being more of a lollipop experience my hands were the lollipop, than eating taffy. the rope, was awesome. my face huge smile after a three hour dinner with a show. really glad that we paid in advance. our tickets for pm on a friday night were , or  after tax and tip. i am glad we did not order additional drinks because i did not have any more room in my stomach. it was a truly remarkable rd birthday celebration."
1482,Lisa H.,1130,2,6/17/18,"i really really really wanted to love alinea. maybe my expectations were too high? if i am going to prepay  and eat at a  michelin star restaurant, should not my expectations be high?? my husband and i finally decided to visit chicago my first time so the first thing i did was to make a reservation at alina. i could not wait to eat here! a lot of my friends have eaten here and all raved about their experience. so what went wrong?? the service was what you would expect at a  star dining restaurant and the staff was friendly. the servers are very knowledgeable. the ambiance is simple, nothing too fancy. prior to us coming to this restaurant, i informed the kitchen staff of my certain allergies to food. the courses they had to change due to my allergies were the worst. food was either too salty or had zero taste. i could not even finish what is on the plate and the portions were small too! there was no wow factor and i found the courses non cohesive.  yes, the balloon was fun but messy to eat and way too sweet. i have to say, the best thing i liked was the surprise kitchen tour and cocktail. i am not sure why there were so many  stars? maybe the patrons hyped themselves up to really love the restaurant? maybe they have never had fine dining in la, ny, italy or spain to say a few. maybe we went on an off night? all i can say is i left disappointed and tired after our  hour long meal."
1483,Natasha B.,1130,4,6/10/18,"ok,  stars for the experience, ambience, wait staff, and desserts. and three stars for other food. we got the. here you are obv paying for great service and the whole experience which i think is what i had imagined it to be. the staff were lovely and not pretentious which was great, offered me a pashmina when i felt cold. the desserts seems to be bursting with flavors small orange with liquor, the balloon , the banana split was to die for, the marischino cherry drink was amazing. my husband enjoyed the flavor of the food more than i did...think he just liked how unique the flavors were. i loved the part where we went into the kitchen to see how they make some drinks. the food came out at a great pace and the waiters were good about answering any questions we had about the dishes. we were surprisingly full after our meal too!"
1484,Charles F.,1130,5,5/25/18,"i have tried restaurants at the summit of fine dining eleven madison park in nyc and restaurants that are more playful hot doug's, wiener circlealinea is the rare breed that excels at both and it is this synthesis that makes it the greatest restaurant i have ever encountered never made it to el bulli. the classic dishes hot cold potato, chocolate bomb drop, helium balloon  are as delightful as the seasonal ones beet juice ice block, venison tacos, seashell extravagance, wintry exploration. there was a simple fried pear that was my favorite if only because its essence reminded me of what the ancient greeks thought their gods ate, ambrosia. the menu has since changed but i believe the minds there have only evolved for the better."
1485,Evan L.,1130,5,5/16/18,"it almost seems silly to discuss an experience as holistically fulfilling and comprehensive as dining at alinea. upon arrival, you are transported into a different world  and the party has yet to begin. three hosts meet you in a remarkable, yet narrow, waiting area, where you are whisked to your seat in the gallery. aptly named, the unique art pieces and structural buildouts are befitting of a museum, or a distinctly upscale home. the atmosphere feels ethereal, as if there is a fog or distant haze enveloping the room. then you stop and realize  i am at a dinner party? twelve guests are seated around a communal table, replete with centerpieces and attentive servers, and a formal tablecloth, and, well  did not i pay a month's mortgage for the opportunity to dine with my beau in relative privacy? right as the suppressed anger seems ready to manifest, your first dish is brought  and yes, it is amazing and delicious, but i am still at this damn communal table. more wine, please? not yet  you are whisked into the kitchen, single file, where you will find what appears to be a totino's pizza roll in placed in front of each guest while the bustle of the kitchen buzzes in its choreographed chaos around you. a presentation by one of the chefs, in which a cocktail is created 's style one of only three machines left in use in the united states provides great theatre, and as the cocktail is poured and the final accoutrements are added to your 'pizza roll,' you enjoy the show and relax a little bit more, knowing you are in for more than an insanely memorable meal  this will be true performance. you return from the kitchen to find the communal table removed. you are directed to your new, private table. it is a beautiful, custom glassacrylic piece that looks like it may or may not have actually been part of the larger table, as everybody in the gallery shares a uniquely sized piece of the same material. before you have time to intellectualize the geometry of the seating arrangement, you notice this bountiful bowl of citrus  navel oranges, tangerines, mandarins, now constitute your personal table centerpiece, and the citrus smell wafting from the bowl is refreshing, tempting, and perfectly moodsetting. you notice the alineaembroidered napkins as your next pour of wine from the pairing arrives with your next course, which is actually two courses. then, the next act of this tour de force occurs  the server pours what is essentially a canister of fog over the oranges, at which point the steam escapes and settles over the entirety of the table and your dishes. as the lights have dimmed, the server brings over a bottomlit bowl of what may be ice, with two translucent orange spheres provided as the third element of this fantastic course. the famous alinea sugar balloon is then served to each patron, and though you have likely seen this  wouldish,' it is still a wonder how they create a green apple flavored candy that actually floats on a string and is still delectable. you should be wondering, what is in the salt, however  as the servers come and remove a potato that has been cooked for  hours in butter and salt, and now will form the base of a clam chowder, prepared tableside with alinea hot sauce and a cracker that harkens back to your earlier pizza roll. you notice the custom, leather alinea coaster, and the wine that is heightening all of your senses, and you are given a reprieve to mentally digest everything you have experienced thus far. the next dish to come out is perhaps the most typical  if anything served at a restaurant of this caliber can be described with that term  a seasonally appropriate dish of pureed ramps, fried morel mushrooms, reconstituted parmesan cheese. this was personally my favorite dish, flavorwise, the entire night  beautiful, clean, fresh, vibrant. and, of course, gorgeous. there is chaos  the soundtrack in the gallery changes to the spinetingling postapocalyptic sound of the elp produced cannibal ox track, scream phoenix, which portends the  wouldestruction' of the gallery ceiling. the staff comes in with step ladders and begins removing what you now realize are large, 'painted' serving platters from the ceiling, placing these large, oblong discs on the respective tables. the choreography ensues as the flavors are painted onto your plate, one server at a time  leaving you to marvel in the pollockian scene on your plate, wondering if you should eat it or, well, hang it in the gallery. luckily you choose the later as the chaotic explosion of sugared elements settles onto your tongue, thanking yourself for making those reservations months ago. think you are done? you are not. a chrystal is brought out to your table on gorgeous mint stems, a perfect cube of mint, eucalyptus, and black lime upon which to end your meal. but this was no meal  this is an experience you will be ruminating about for the rest of your culinary life. thank you, alinea."
1486,Waqas S.,1130,4,5/11/18,". stars pros very unique experience from beginning to end. as soon as we were seated we were presented with a menu in the form of an impossible word search puzzle impossible because the food names did not mean anything to us. the point of this was to shroud the experience in an aura of mystery, where you do not know what to expect next. there were instances of food items hidden within things we thought were just there for decor, there was smoke, fire, snow, helium filled edible balloons . incredible attention to detail. everything was meticulous, from the fact that the entire restaurant staff seemed to know it was our anniversary, to the presentation of each course. everything placed for a reason. at one point we thought they had simply forgotten to take away the bowl of fire after one of our courses, only to discover the bowl of fire was left there because beneath it was a potato roasting for another food item a few courses later. world class service. we had requested no pork items and they went above and beyond to accommodate our request. one of the courses was to take place in the actual kitchen, so they asked the entire room to get up and follow them. our server asked my wife and i to enter the room last, which we did not realize the reasoning for until we got there, and understood that our two dishes at the end of the counter in the kitchen would not have any pork in them. seems simple enough in theory but cannot say other restaurants would care to put in so much thought. food. most of the food was great and full of unique flavor. sometimes the flavor changed with every bite. sometimes the flavors were unique and unexpected. cons some of the food items were not to our taste  however this may be just because we can be picky eaters sometimes. also, we did notice that there was a very common theme among the savory items. we were hoping for a bit more variety in flavor. at times the service was a little slow. understandably the food takes some extreme detail to create, however other simple things like asking for a coke took a little longer than expected."
1487,Keith S.,1130,3,10/31/18,"the overall experience was very good with impeccable service but the food was not as good as what i have expected given the  michelin stars. the best dish was the pork stew. the squab, scallop noodles and langoustine nori paper broth were also pretty good. i did not like the opening dish of trout roe with coconut and lychee. the sweet dishes were not as good as the savory ones. we were late with reservation so only able to book the salon menu. for first timer, if you were not able to book the gallery menu, i would wait and try another day. given the expectation, the salon menu may leave you disappointed."
1488,Bailey Z.,1130,3,10/22/18,"i have been waiting so long to try alinea. even before the chef's table episode. was it overhyped? were the expectations too high? possibly, but what it came down to was the flavor of the food. it is hard to even explain the degustation journey that we embarked on, but i think of the  menu items we tried, there were few that stuck out, flavorwise. there were also many interesting textures, but not the ones that were particularly enjoyable. it was also tough to understand any cohesive theme as many displayed use of molecular gastronomy but i think it was used to showcase the technique rather than the food. we started with a communal salad with avocado, kiwi, cucumber, and herbs with a light dressing sprayed on with a perfume sprayer. there were whispers that it felt like we were eating just flowers. the best part was the little brioche bun that came with the salad. biting into it, i was surprised with the filling of mushroom, feta cheese, and jalapeno. we were then whisked alway to a tour of the kitchen where we had a drink and a small bite with puffed pizza dough gnocco fritto filled with caramelized mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, brushed with rendered pepperoni, and dusted with tomato powder, fennel pollen, and garnished with fresh basil. when we returned, our communal table had been broken down into our individual tables which was a fun surprise. from then on, we the meal became a blur as we had plate after plate of visuallystimulating dishes. i did enjoy the cultured charred onion cream  that smokey smell still lingers in my mind. the sunflower petals with toasted sunflower seed custard, sunflower leaf oil and golden osetra caviar was a beautiful presentation. the scallop , mustard, and chili thai noodle dish was the most flavorful dish of the evening and a standout. the shot of lemongrass that accompanied it was one of the most visually appeasing dishes, which glowed in the dark dining room. the next few dishes including the korean bbq glazed octopus with pyrolyzed negi onions, the nori roll, and the langoustine paper were misses for me. although fun, the clam chowder, with the potato that had been cooking in front of us was one of the biggest misses. i really did not enjoy the flavor of that chowder. the next course after this was the wagyu, foie gras, and matsutake. how can you screw up wagyu at a three star michelin restaurant? you cannot. the wagyu, pan roasted with herbs, garlic, pepper and butter was kept simple and amazing as it usually is and one of my favorite bites. we dined to the music of composer gioachino rossini. the next dish, many at the table did not enjoy, nor finish. the chilled peach and begonia soup, heirloom tomatoes, mascarpone, nasturtium and honey was too chilled to enjoy, but i did enjoy that lovely heirloom tomato flavor. the transition dish with palo santo ice cream, charred tamarind meringue, grilled pineapple and candied hoja santa was also a great dish. loved this as a dessert. it was served with mexican hot chocolate milk punch. the next couple of nolstagic dishes featured the classic helium sugar balloon which was green apple flavored. the caramel popcorn liquid was also a fun presentation. then, of course the finale with the multitude of frozen treats and sweets that were painted on our table was quite the spectacle. i think both chef grant achatz and simon davies are creative geniuses and are doing amazing things. overall, if you come here, view it more as performance art that you are paying a hefty price for. we spent . gratuity and tax included on tock for a meal in the gallery. was it worth it for the food? probably not. was it worth it for the experience once? definitely!"
1489,Linda T.,1130,4,10/13/18,"i was so shocked we were able to get last minute reservations to alinea during my visit this past weekend! they take reservation online only and you basically purchase tickets at a specific time and date. first day looking, everything was all full, so i kept checking daily and something actually opened up. the reservations are not refundable so if you get a reservation, you are going! we sat in the salon upstairs and had about  courses throughout the night. our servers were very attentive and would explain each dish. they use a lot of aromatics and visual platings to stimulate tastes and accentuate each course. one of my favorite was this scallop noodles in curry sauce..the texture of the noodles were amazing since it is made of scallops ! the sauce and the overall taste was perfect. the most anticipated part was the last course, which is a helium green apple taffy balloon! everything is edible, even the string. it is super sticky and a lot of people in the room got the balloon stuck to their hair or glasses, so be careful. overall a great experience with unique twists and turns. service and ambiance are amazing. im so happy to at least have the opportunity to try it once! top  restaurant in the world...# this year, but was once #! amazing!"
1490,Sneha P.,1130,5,9/19/18,"chef achatz's mastery of flavor, cooking techniques and his creativity will surely get a nod from even the pickiest eaters. it does not take long to realize that you expect the unexpected at alinea starting with the menu which is presented as a crossword puzzle. the highlights of the night included the ranina, ranina, pizza puff, perfume course with the scallops , and the squab roasted in coal. each meal is arranged with such care, precision and timed perfectly for a harmonious meal. from amuse bouches to tantalize your taste buds to palate cleansers before dessert, you certainly get a range of little bites over the course of your meal. i also enjoyed the kitchen tour and the whole night lived up to the hype. there was only one dish that really did not agree with me but  is not bad at all. because of their ever changing menu, i have heard rumors that the previous dishes were more outstanding but i think that varies with the individual's preference. balloon and the banana dessert were just awesome do it for the gram. now the price and the ease of getting a reservation was my least favorite part haha i live on the east coast and it is easier to get reservations in new york cities finest restaurants than it is to get one at alinea. the price is also more than some of the  michelin star restaurants such as eleven madison park in nyc but the gallery offers much more tastings which validates the price. i finally managed to get a reservation at the salon and i think it was well worth it. getting a table at the gallery requires much more preplanning and time but i am sure it is worth it. i did enjoy my salon experience very much but hopefully i will be back for the whole shebang another time. after eating at countless restaurants casual & fine dining alike, i can vouch for the experience at alinea  there is nothing that comes close to it. every chef can cook a delicious meal but how many actually dare to get you outside your comfort zone and make you pay attention to your surroundings? bravo, bravo, bravo! and do yourself a favor and do not try to research too much before your reservation. half the fun is in the surprise!"
1491,Ryne D.,1130,5,8/25/17,"i mean...what could this review tell you that countless other reviews, bestof lists, documentaries, books, and three little nonyelp stars could not? sure, the restaurant has changed in the past couple years, but i do not think i missed out on too much. i placed my reservations in late may of ' for two for an early june reservation  i got lucky as it had just reopened and i do not think you will be able to get a table only two and a half weeks out anymore. i went with the salon with standard pairings. my fiancee and i are not wine connoisseurs, but we were not about to pass up paired drinks. service is similar to what i have experienced at other achatz places. yes, this is the finest of fine dining, but our servers were smart enough to realize we were a young couple out for a fun night. they answered all of our questions, made sure we were taken care of, and never once did i feel out of place. i even overheard a server try his best at translating a dish description to guest who only spoke spanish. it is hard to type out a description of everything we had, especially with it being  courses and most of them having wine or mezcal with it. there was dehydrated scallops in a corn soup. smoky chicken thigh dressed as the mexican flag. a yellow dish of curry, pork, and yellow chopsticks. and of course, we finished off with the signature helium filled candy balloon. oh, and rather than their former famous dessert painted on the table, ours was painted on...a painting. each dish was perfectly balanced, and by that i mean balanced between wtf are they serving us and wtf are these flavors in my mouth. it is a fun time and a unique experience. is this deserving of the praise of being not only one of the best countries in the city, but also the world? i mean, it is close, but until my lola grandma starts accepting reservations, you will be ok coming to alinea."
1492,Christina G.,1130,2,6/15/17,"our visit to alinea was extremely disappointing. this was the first ~pp meal we have had where we felt cheated and duped. there were a few high points but many, many more low points, and the lowest of lows included food that we could not even stomach to swallow. all the magicwhimsy and the immersive dining experience that alinea is known for was missing. first of all, the ticketing system is pretty stressful. pro tip if you decide to go against my advice and go to alinea look ahead at the two seating times and prices which vary day to day, so you know exactly what you want when the ticketing system opens. the slots fill quickly. we bought tickets for a few hours after our flight arrived and stressed out about possibly missing our reservation. onto the evening we ate at alinea it began with a lot of promise. we were led to a communal dining room with leaves on the floor and a delicious array of seafood items. one of the staff spoke to us as a group, but he was basically yelling at us for his voice to be able to reach to the other end of the long table. we were then led into the kitchen for a cooking demonstration and another course, which was interesting and tasty, and when we were taken back to the dining room, it had been transformed into tables and chairs. that was cool, and was followed by an amaaaazing corn soup with scallop noodles. but it went downhill from there. the next two courses triggered our gag reflexes, and i could not bear to finish mine. they were a sour coconut soup and an array of molecular gastronomy foods, including a jamon iberico foam and some soup of sorts with weird jellies in it. the texture and the tastes were disgusting and it got to the point where i feared bursting the jellies in my mouth lest they taste sour like vomit  sadly, that was what happened with almost every bite. remembering that the meal cost ~, i begrudgingly forced myself to eat as much as i could. the next few courses were fish grilled over rosemary, short rib, and some other meatbased dishes that were good but sort of standard and not worth the price we paid for the meal. the desserts were more what we had expected cherry flavored glass, banana helium balloons, the freeze dried ice cream, but it was still a bit lame. for example, there was a part where they turned off most of the lights and had loud music over the stereo while the staff took decorations off the wall to use as a plate, but you could see the stereo speakers all over the room. the wine pairings were good but nothing too remarkable. all four of us were so disenchanted and let down by our experience. this was one of the main reasons we came to chicago, and we felt bad that we made our friends who live in chicago go there, although they would have gone at some point anyway."
1493,Yu H.,1130,5,2/12/17,"a night at alinea is more than just about the food. it truly is an experience, from the moment you step in the door to the moment you leave. as soon as we stepped inside, we were greeted by  people who took our coats and brought us to the table. the decor is modern and clean. throughout the whole night, we had  waiters roaming around at our service. they were all entertaining in their own way and one guy in particular was quite a hoot. they all looked like they loved their job which definitely helps enhance the dining experience. it was a  course meal and while i am not going to describe all of them, i can tell you that all of them were amazing in their own way with the exception of one but probably because i do not like cheese in general. every course is innovative and exceptional in both presentation and flavor. every dish is different and exciting in their own way, some which you cannot even figure out how to eat without a description from the waiter. some of the highlights of the evening included condensed strawberry desert with bubble gum ice cream and cherry glass which was a perfect end to the evening with an ice cold desert prepared likely with liquid nitrogen. the other dessert themed around chocolate and rocks was almost as good and even prettier to look at. the thaiinspired coconut shellfish broth with pompano was probably the best dish of the night and one of the best i have ever had even though i do not typically like coconut flavors. just stunning. the wagyu short rib with bitter cocoa sauce was incredible. as with a lot of the dishes, it truly is tough to put the flavor into words. this is one of those you have to try for yourself to really understand the flavors. the prettiest plate of the night perhaps in a tie with the rocks dessert was the maitake mushroom dish with a duo of sauces made based around blueberry and lapsang souchong a chinese black tea. the best smelling dish of the night goes to the corn soup with scallop paper which had an aroma to die for. they dehydrated scallops into papers which were rehydrated into noodles when the hot corn soup was poured over it, amazing! it is definitely expensive the most expensive meal i have ever had but it is worth every last penny with the overall experience that is provided. this is obviously only for a special occasion for the vast majority of people, but i highly recommend it."
1494,Yixiao Y.,1130,5,2/2/17,"bf took me here last summer when i was in chicago. was absolutely mind blown by the creative concept and the quality of food. fave course was hands down the scallop soup and the helium balloon. it was so fun to be able to talk in a ridiculously high voice. we also got to chat with mike, the executive chef, after the dinner and took a look at the kitchen. only bummer is that the head chef, grant dude who was on chefs table, was down the street at another restaurant that night so we did not meet him. great restaurant deserving the three michelin stars, and definitely planning to come back in the future. "
1495,Kristin Y.,1130,5,1/22/17,"i am going to agree with most of the other reviewers here, and let you guys know this place is so. good. if you do not like surprises, i guess i can say that i am not surprised that you might not like this place. however, i love trying new and unexpected food. if you come into this meal knowing that, you will be satisfied. we opted for the salon option, as that was all that was available for a top. we would love to try the other option the gallery sometime if we have the chance! we also had the base level wine pairings which i absolutely recommend. there were a few dishes that were enhanced so much by the wine. out of all our courses, there was only one that we did not like contrastespaa. my favorites were ice tropical flavors topped with trout roe, crunchpaper sea scallop paper with corn broth, and bone crunchy bone marrow puffed rice with wagyu beef. if you have the chance to get here, do it!"
1496,Giovanni G.,1130,4,1/9/17,"my first michelin rated restaurant! a star one at that too! i have first heard about alinea because of pictures of their unique food presentations plus their famous edible balloons. i was a bit worried that their renovations in  would mean big changes to the food, but do not worry, the balloons are still there! i decided to go with the salon which is their lowest tier with  courses since this would be our first star restaurant, and not sure if we would be acclimated to the food of that tier. street parking in the area seemed okay beware some locations require permits, but otherwise valet is available for . you could easily walk past the restaurant without knowing it since the building is nondescript with only a minimal sign on the sidewalk. once you past the front door, the front desk is very accommodating, including taking care of coats think they are stored in heated closets and any transportation needs. at the start of the meal, one of the servers will place a placard outlining the courses so you can follow along. alinea is known for their deconstruction of food that follows simple themes like ice, stone, bone, etc. i think the best example is the 'nostalgia' theme where they took a cake and separated flavors that you would associate with your childhood apart like strawberry, banana, etc. among the  courses, the wagyushortrib bone was heavenly. i never hard such a thick cut before and the sauce is so scrumptious. i would say there are ~ courses that i was not fond of due to a more vinegarsour taste prefer more sweeter food, but i will attribute that to not being acclimated to those type of dishes. many of the courses comes with a neat effect ranging from dried scallops that melts into the broth to a dried ice smoke gushing out a bowl. i especially love the fruity aromatics that helps accentuate the course. be sure to come up with a  second phrase to be recorded when the balloon comes out! if nothing comes to mind, singing happy birthday works! one thing that i appreciated for an upscale restaurant is how chill everything was. the only dress code is that men were requested to wear jackets but definitely not required. you could get wine by the bottle or by the glass and sounds like they also have beer. all of our waiters were pretty friendly and do not mind taking pictures. you may consider bringing a dslr like i did due to the low lighting i ended up shooting at iso . allinall i had a good time and would come back to try the gallery experience. protip make your reservations early pref one month in advance! one cool thing is you pay everything upfront, including tip so the only bill you may have to pay in the end are for the drinks. on the other hand, that does mean all sales are final. alinea will contact you one week ahead of your reservation to ask for allergies and other accommodations so make sure to put in a valid email addressphone number!"
1497,Robin D.,1130,3,11/26/16,"i have been wanting to check this place out for a few years now. it has been ranked as one of the top restaurants in the world so we decided to celebrate our th anniversary here. my rating for this place comes with highly critical expectations and rightfully so. i have been to charlie trotters, tru,  grams, duomo sicily, europea montreal and other ultra fine dining places here and abroad and i honestly cannot say that alinea takes the top spot in my dining list. if your exposure to this dining category is minimal to none, you might say that this is the best dining experience ever. otherwise, you might think it would be at par to some, better than other or even worse than some. i had a good experience not a wow experience. we paid  pp without drinks and we were seated on the second floor. the moment i sat down, against the wall i felt the seat was a bit low and uncomfortable. as minor as this is, it sets the tone for rest of your dining experience. troutcoconutpassion fruit  interesting scallop nori  super yum sanma fish  i am a seafood lover and this one i did not consume, it just did not taste right. the presentation was superb. ciderorangemaple...  good pork belly  fantastic but anyone can make this dish taste good. pearpaprikajamon  i already forgot this mastic concorde  if this is the one with the foie grois then it was outstanding black trufflegruyere  this one was truly divine wagyu  so so so good! short rib  delish desserts  well done although the servings were very small, i thought it was enough. i am glad we did not order the soup that was the special for the day  usd for a bowl of soup because at the end of meal, i could not even finish my dessert service is good to very good. we had some dietary restrictions against refined sugar and the email communication was very efficient. just like most places that charge a lot, it can be a bit pretentious. i have to say that the service was more casual than refined elegance. there were a few flaws like they refilled my sparkling water with flat water. they tried to take my dish even when i was not done twice. we mentioned our anniversary in our email and there was no acknowledgement of it in any way shape or form. a bit disappointing. all in all it was a good experience. was it worth the money? sure. would i recommend it? absolutely! would i be back? not unless someone else is paying the bill."
1498,Renato S.,1130,3,10/26/16,"we visited here the weekend of the chicago marathon and purchased the base level tickets. i was not impressed with many of the courses, pork belly, beef short rib, and wagyu did not do much for me. there was also a deboned mackerel. the best course was a dehydrated scallop served in a broth. the most fun was the banana flavored helium balloon of course . overall the service was excellent, staff was friendly, they accommodated a trip to see the kitchen after the meal. after forgetting the souvenir menus in the cab they mailed us additional ones we live in maryland. i do not regret the visit, but i cannot say we enjoyed the meal very much. it is also hard to judge because of the  available dining options we chose the cheapest which was still very . be prepared to spend, even after the  per person, they offered a supplemental dish the night we were there of white truffles for an additional  a person, and the whole table has to get it. we chose not to. we also skipped the wine pairing of  a person i think? and instead opted to share a bottle. we had great fun with the gastronomy vibe, but the room we were in was quite isolated, next to the bathroom and stuffy to me. it was quiet and a bit awkward to listen to everyone's conversations."

1501,Amoli P.,1130,5,8/15/16,"alinea does not need another  star review, but i am going to add it anyway. my husband and i went to alinea last thursday as a birthday treat. neither of us had experienced the original alinea but we were extremely excited to see the new revamp. true to his word, chef achatz has reimagined alinea away from the original mystere and trickery and has concentrated more on straight up elegance and mindblowing food. i had not been to alinea before but i had heard and read enough about the experience. i have eaten at next twice vegan and modern chinese and you cannot help but compare one experience to the others. when it comes to food...there is no question. alinea is on a whole different level compared to next. there was less shock factor at alinea than you have at next...less theatrics. but the food taste and quality is noticeably better  and that is saying a lot because i think next is phenomenal. what i love about next is the way the dishes are presented as tools, and something you did not realize was even edible and thought was a center piece because the th course halfway through the meal. or you will find out your plate is edible at the end but only after you rehydrate it or something like that. alinea has less of that kind of show experience which i love at next and focuses just on wowing you with their creations. for example, one dish was dehydrated scallop paper that was rehydrated in front of you with an amazing broth to become a large scallop noodle that tasted like the best scallop of your life. service was impeccable from start to finish and the new atmosphere is open and brightly lit with a simple elegance of whites and grays. i was actually surprised at how bright it was and had expected much darker lighting that gave a more intimate feel. we did one alcohol pairing and one nonalcohol pairing. the wines were exquisite and plentiful and i was happy to just take a few sips from each of my husband's servings as i would have been pretty drunk if i had a pairing of my own. the nonalcoholic pairing was not as inventive as what you will see at next bell pepper foam, interesting drinkware methods but each pairing was some sort of juice that included  normal ingredients and  crazy ingredient that blew your mind. for example, crazy ingredients like banana pepper or black garlic. i do not want to spoil the surprise by describing the dishes but trust that you will not be disappointed and this is an experience to remember. the hype is worth it, the accolades are worth it. i feel very fortunate to have experienced such culinary genius."
1502,Rick R.,1130,5,7/29/16,"alinea has been on my bucket list for a few years, and when i saw spinning plates at the milwaukee film festival, my desire to experience alinea grew tenfold! it was closed to remodel and redesign the menu for a while earlier this year. when the reservations opened up, my friend was able to get us in. there seem to be two dining experiences, and the reservation we were able to get was for the  course experience. i believe the other might be called the galleria experience with a few more courses. i did not really know what to expect, especially since there were changes recently. there were diners at two other tables when we arrived in the dining room we were assigned to. it was fairly quiet. i sat across from my friend at a wide table, which allowed plenty of space for the plating and presentation, but it seemed like she was far away and i did not want to speak too loudly in such a quiet dining room. eventually, other diners arrived and the noise level picked up, so i felt more comfortable and relaxed talking across the table in a voice louder than the near whisper i was using when we arrived. i thought the staff was warm and friendly and did everything they could to make us feel welcome and enjoy our experience. one of our servers even joked with us to keep the atmosphere light and fun. a wine expert was sent over to answer questions and make suggestions, but in a very laid back way, as a friend would who wanted to help you make a good decision and not like a wine snob would that wanted to push product. for our experience, he suggested we start with a glass of champagne, so we did. that worked for the first  or  courses, and then i switched to a glass of pinot noir per his recommendation due to the next group of courses coming. as for the food, what can i say? my mind was blown! that is why i wanted to dine at alinea, to have my mind blown. i posted some photos, but i am not going to get into much detail because i could not possibly do the dishes justice with my descriptions. a card on the table listed single words to help us track our courses. the server asked if we had any food allergies and explained that the chef uses fresh and inseason ingredients to help plan the menu. we waited in anticipation to see what dish and what components of the dish would represent the word for that course. i think anticipation is what heightens the experience. what are they going to do next?!?! the menu card stated ice would be the first course. our first course was served in a handcarved bowl of ice. inside the bowl were refreshing flavors of ebi shrimp and citrus and coconut. the next course was crunchy paper on the menu card. what arrived were crisp, small sheets of paper made from scallops ! they turned scallops into crisp flat sheets! they were served in a flavorful seafood broth. a very savory scallop mousse wrapped in nori seaweed paper was also included in this course. the rest of the evening continued this way with mind blowing, beautifully presented, and very delicious dish after dish. we were both full after the first  courses, but we are not quitters, so we pressed on to the final stretch, which included an edible strawberry balloon and a platter with a combination of flavors, colors, and textures displayed like fine art! at the end, we were given another menu card with a few more words to help describe each course. from the warm greeting at the hostess station, to the welcoming and approachable servers, to the mind blowing food and carefully selected wines, this was one of the best, if not the best, dining experiences i have ever had in my life. it was worth every penny, and i will to do it again! i am grateful for the invitation to join my friend for this amazing dining experience, so i could get to alinea sooner than later!"
1503,Michael H.,1130,5,7/22/16,"this was an amazing wonderful experience, certainly much more than just another great meal. more to follow soon, when i have had time to sleep on it. dining at alinea is an elaborate affair, so let me elaborate just what it was that we ate and drank osetra caviar, king crab, and condiments presented in glass in wells in a large block of ice.  krug clos du mesnil champagne, france  cucumber, feta, caper leaf gin, green tomato, chartreuse scallop , corn, butter shio kombu, nori  domaine laroche les clos chablis grand cru  sweet potato curry yolks collet demisec champagne, france nv  white asparagus  lychee  lily bulb our bowl filled with citrus was set to release a great quantity of smoky mist, as solid carbon dioxide sublimated to vapor and poured out onto the table, then down to the floor. icefish  daisy mandarin  radish  kiedrich grafenberg riesling splese, robert weil, rheingau, germany  morel  blueberry  lapsang souchong onion, purple allium, black pepper  shiraz, henschke, mt edelstone, south australia gruyre  black truffle  pumpernickel a volcanic bowl was placed on the table, containing aromatics, such as cinnamon and star anise, and set alight something was presented on volcanic platter . . . . veal cheek  chamomile  melon wagyu  rice  myoga  the restaurant's name comes from a variant name of the pilcrow, [  ] a typographical mark used to indicate individual paragraphs. the name alinea comes from latin, a lineƒÅ, meaning off the line. please do not bring your small children or babies, this is not the right place for them."
1504,N L.,1130,5,7/9/16,"it is so glad that alinea completed their remodeling work and it is an excited news that we got our reservation tickets!!! feels so lucky!!!!!! we chose the gallery one and we do think it is a serious contender for best restaurant in the us another contender is the french laundry. first, the new decoration completely blow our mind. the gallery one will let everyone sit together to take the first course in one huge table. after everyone completed the cocktails with a kitchen tour, the huge table disappeared magically and the individual tables are ready. if you realize the paintings on the roof, yeah! they are not only beautiful but also for the surprise of your last course!! i prefer not to leak the details here, but that is indeed a super surprise!! second, for the food, most of the dishes were pretty amazing! the molecular gastronomy cooking is super creative! the scallop in paper shape is the best scallop we ever took, and the cheese course is the best pair we tried before! the strawberry ballon is not only tasty, but also made the whole dinning room full of joy and laugh. the last course, wow, one of the most creative one we ever seen in us! service part, each staff is well trained, extremely attentive and polite. they also quite willing to share the knowledge and experience they have and answer any question we have. if you still trying hard to get the tickets, try it harder! totally worths!!!!"
1505,Christopher P.,1130,5,4/12/17,"this restaurant delivered to me the finest meal i have ever experienced. we had saw this restaurant on netflix chef table and have been itching to go there ever since! as we were led to the newly renovated restaurant we were curious and anxious about the meal to come. we were definitely not disappointed! we were given attic char roe paired with tropical fruit in these different powders and gels. then we got our favorite dish of the night pured dehydrated langoustine which is kinda like a shrimp kinda like a lobster floating in saffron broth. holy crap it was to die for! this was followed by melt in your mouth short ribs, crispy sushi rice with bone marrow and much much more. another great touch was the fantastic tea selection and the sugar balloon filled with helium that makes the whole dining room laugh along with you. another point is that when you walk in it seems kind of stuffy and quiet and it is as if by magic that the atmosphere starts to loosen up and you can really have the dinner of a lifetime. we were disappointed that grant was not there but his visions and his dishes and his creativity and his presence could really be felt in the food and i think that that is the most important part. in all my years as a yelper and as a human, this was my best meal, by far!"
1506,Ksenja T.,1130,5,4/4/17,"three michelin stars.  in the world world's  best, . we made our reservation  months in advance for the gallery. after spending a small fortune ahead of time, we were more than intrigued to see if alinea would live up to the hype andor compare to other michelin restaurants of this caliber. pros newly renovated interior, still intimate yet simple. elements of surpriseshow. staff brad, miguel, everyone was amazing. attentive to allergies. experiencing the alinea kitchen very smart idea. drink pairings not mandatory for the whole table if one person opts for it.  the iconic taffy helium balloon and grand finale dessert were everything we had anticipated, and more. seriously mindblown. the number of desserts in the tasting menuperfect for me as it is my favorite course. thai inspired dish outstanding. my one point of contention we had the  pm seating. i personally felt as though the pace of the courses went very fast. by the end of the more savory courses, i felt overwhelmed as the food was quite decadent ie. black truffle mousse, caviar, lobster , more black truffle sandwich, wagyu beef, bone marrow, mushroom. i am surprised to read that anyone would leave alinea hungry because this to me seems impossible. the staff, however, were very gracious and we stayed for as long as we wanted."
1507,Dave N.,1130,2,2/12/17,"we absolutely hated it. i am giving two stars because of the ambiance i guess. i wrote the below email to alinea customer service. they wrote me back to tell me that they take complaints very seriously then never responded back months later. do not waste your money. to whom it may concern, on december th, , my girlfriend and i visited the alinea gallery for a much anticipated experience. we had seen grant achatz on chef's table, spinning plates and several interviews needless to say, we were very excited. they initially sat us at a group table for the first course. for an  tab i expected a private, secluded table with private service. the first course was terrible. the egg souffle was bland, the pickled lobster and truffles were just not our preference. they then moved us to the kitchen for the second course. again, same complaint, we did not need to see the kitchen and it seemed tacky. next, we ordered a cabernet, they served us a bordeaux without asking us if that was ok it tasted nothing like a cab. they then sat us down at a private table for the third course. from this point on, we were extremely disappointed. i am afraid to say, without exaggerating, that neither of us like one bite one of course. it was all overwhelmed with, what we think was, sassafras. it was a sort of pungent licorice taste. we tasted this strange flavor in almost every dish. it was all odd and offputting. we also expected more elaborate gastronomy experimenting. we have seen the balloon in documentaries, which was an odd fake banana flavor, and the ice cream, which tasted like freezer burned dipndots no offense intended, that is the only parallel i can draw. i do not like to write reviews and i certainly do not mean to offend. but, our disappointment in this experience bordered on depressing. we were dumbfounded. i just felt compelled to provide you with some feedback."
1508,Irene X.,1130,1,11/24/16,"totally not worth the money. very disappointing. total joke! i want to say these words out loud so many times after having a chance to experience the wholly expensive tasting menu at the alinea !!! i could not believe myself after waiting for  months and finally be able to sit and have their tasting menu & wine pairings  for the meal  domesticintenational wine plus tax plus service charge at the galeria, that this is the worst experience i have ever had among all other  michelinstarred restaurants in the country that i have been to. having a very expensive meal at  michelinstarred restaurant, without any doubts, everyone's expectation is the service, meal & beverages and the overall experience should be superb. sadly, it did not happen at the alinea. first of all, the guy who was in charged of pouring the wine, was not friendly at all and the worst thing was, every single bottle of wine that he poured to my glass was only a sip size of volume. i have finished every single wine before the food came, therefore, i totally do not think i have experienced the food and wine pairings at the alinea. secondly, the menu was laid out on a piece of paper with about  different unique names, just their way to try to surprise and impress us with the food they will serve, without giving out all the details about the descriptions of the dish. unfortunately, every single dish that came to our table did not impress us. at. all. zero. for a three michelinstarred restaurant at least i would expect there would be at least caviar, lobster , abalone in one of the dish. what we got was mostly cheap ingredients! a total joke! all dish was served in a tiny portion with mostly sweet, creamy sauce and among  courses there were  dessert which were chocolates and ice cream. are you kidding us? we are coming here to spend over  worth of meal not to have ice cream or chocolates !!! the other courses that are really disappointing are fry a deep fried of icefish with orange mandarin sauce. to be honest, almost all fish dish served in chinese food restaurant tastes better than this. yellow  pork belly. curry. banana. served in a tiny yellow flexible plastic bowl with a few very dry, tiny pieces of pork belly covered with yellow curry sauce. a total joke! the pork belly you can get from a lot of food trucks taste much better than this dish and the size is a lot bigger too! paint  cherry. white chocolate. bourbon. nothing exceptional here, does not matter how good the paintings the chef was trying to do, this main item in this dish basically just white chocolate. bone  wagyu beef served on top of bone marrow. a good wagyu should just melted in your mouth. instead, the wagyu here was flavorless, did not melt in my mouth. petal glass  purple allium, black pepper, onion. lapsang souchong. maitake. the biggest item and served in the most generous size was the purple allium flowers which were inedible. finally, again, totally not worth the  !!!"
1509,Amelia M.,1130,4,3/27/16,"i really want to give this place a  stars, but my experience was not the best. went to chicago for a long weekend trip, and decided to come here to celebrate end of exams. we reserved  weeks before and paid in advance online. we were presented with a  course meal, some of my favourites included the lobster , black truffle, duck, and milk chocolate. the lobster dish included curry, earl grey, and grapefruit. the duck dish was presented  ways including foie gras. the black truffle was presented like a dumpling, and as you bite into it the richness of the truffle and parmesan cheese ooozes out. the milk chocolate finale was a piece of artwork made in front of us, consisting of a centerpiece of chocolate, with splashes of violet puree, hazelnut, and cream on the side. i was not a big fan of the lily bulb, and rhubarb. the lily bulb was way to sour for my taste, i believe it was included as a palette cleanser but nevertheless, i did not enjoy it. the rhubarb consisted of celery root, celery branch, and licorice, and was a miss. overall, the presentation, creativity, and attention to detail in all of the dishes are spectacular. definitely a  on that end. however, the taste of the plates were a hit or miss. in my opinion, there is definitely a greater emphasis on the presentation of the food versus the actual taste. the waiterswaitresses that we encountered seemed a bit pretentious. i felt like we were constantly being pushed to finish our dishes so they can serve the next dish, and this definitely detracted from the overall dining experience. only thing i liked was when we left the restaurant, the doorman called us a cab. i would give the overall service a .. overall verdict superb presentation of the dishes, subpar service. would not recommend. i am sure there are comparable restaurants in the chicago dining scene with better service."
1510,Grace H.,1130,3,1/13/16,"after wanting to eat at alinea for the longest time, i finally made it to there for my th birthday!! i was super excited and soooo happy i was able to get a reservation. i was literally checking every single day and pretty much gave up!! but i ended up being able to share a table with  other lovely ladies, so i was stoked!!. it was also my first time visiting chicago, which i had heard great things about. honestly, i probably would have made a trip to chicago just for alinea, but good thing i did not. i was not impressed. maybe even disappointed given the hype and excitement. i have eaten at six  michelinstar restaurants french laundry, joel robuchon, benu, jeangeorges, & grace, and alinea unfortunately was the only one that truly let me down ' i am not going to give restaurants  just because everyone else or food critics or whoever thought so. so this is just my honest, humble opinion.  okay, so if i were to rate alinea for presentation and creativity. sure, it probably is the best of the best, especially if you go back a few years ago, i feel not that many restaurants were on the same level. however, times have changed, other chefs have learned to master the art of presentation and innovative food.  taste of the food was decent is all that i can describe. in fact the only dish i really really enjoyed was the potato puree with black truffle. nothing too crazy, but ooh so flavorful. it left me wanting more. i cannot really say that for any of the other things i ate. uni corn i remember was good too.  maybe this is getting too much into personal tastepreference, but too much use of strong flavored pickled garnishes that took away from the actual taste of the main dish. i thought fresh and good quality ingredients should not be overpowered. at first i tried to eat everything on the plate since i am pretty sure the chef planned each & every item on there with an intention. but towards the end, i realized it was making my meal less enjoyable so i stopped eating them.  i loveeeeeeeeeee dessert, so even after all this, i was still hoping dessert could win me over. it did not. okay, maybe my own fault for already having seen pictures, but as artistic and fun as it was. i did not care for the actual eating part of the dessert...now this makes me really really sad. i am usually the one who is eating me and my dining companion's share of dessert, cleaning off the plate...the dessert was aokay. service was great no complaints. presentation was mostly wonderful minus the barnacles and olive oil cake inside the plant i thought was a bit too much lol. taste was honestly a let down, considering alinea is supposed to be one of the world's best restaurants. for a hefty  per person, i do not want just a food show, i expect all my food to be freaking delicious too!! maybe my palate just is not eclectic enough for alinea??? maybe they are trying too hard to be weirddifferent?? ahhh i do not know...but entire meal no steak lobster duckquailshrimpscallopscaviarfoie graspasta...felt like something was missing...like a main entree?? haha...me and my bf both felt the meal did not feel complete. one time experience...okay...but really no need to ever go back. i went to eat at grace the next day. honestly, i would pick grace over alinea."
1511,Andrew C.,1130,4,12/9/15,"the reason i was in chicago was for a buisness trip. zoo we mama this place was really expensive. it is about  a person. when my wife told me about this place i was not sure but you know me i would do anything for my family. they had multiple courses that were very small but they were about  courses that is a lot of food. i did not mind the small portions just because of how many there were. my favorite portion was probably the lobster it was tender and melted right in my mouth especially with the melted butter, zoo we mama it was amazing. the waiters were kind and really attentive. when i came here i expected nothing but a bunch of rich snobs and really expensive food but i got a great meal that can fill up anybody. considering that there was a lot of courses the price was still extremely high but i would defintiley come here if i were you. and you know me i am a giant guy and all of those courses did fill me up. the prices were expensive but i think it was worth it. i would give this place a  star if the prices were not as high, unlike the dollar menu at mcdonalds which of course is my favorite. but overall a great place."
1512,Hang T.,1130,4,1/12/15,"i wanted to treat my husband to a wonderful dinner for his graduation. i heard so many good things about this place. it was considered the # restaurant in the us and in the world's top for ten the past few years. since we were going to be in chicago at the time, i stalked the computer until they released their dinner tickets. getting reservations  not your typical process. you have to wait until they announce online that they have released the tickets for their tasting menu. usually they release tickets two months in advanced i.e. releasing tickets for june in april. seven minutes after they put up the message, i got on their website and saw that all the times between  and  were taken. that was quick. we had to settle with . if you do not jump on it quick, you will not get the datetimes you want. i believe they only accept parties , , and . sometimes they will list cancellations on their facebook page so you might be able to get in that way as well. remember that each person will be , not including wine pairings. the service  service was awesome as you can imagine. my gosh they were attentive. ready and quick to clean off your plate and bring on the next course. walked me to the bathroom and had a new napkin to put on my lap each time i came back. gratuity is already included in the price so you do not have to worry about that. very friendly and not at all stuck up like i would expect them to be at one of the top restaurants in the world. the food  for the most part the food amazed me. you get  to  dishes and the meal will last  hours. i was very surprised by the different ways food could be displayed and created. i would never expect certain flavors to go with certain ingredients i.e. maple syrup and swiss chard. some of them worked and some of them were a little too outlandish for my taste. i am very simple when it comes to food. my favorite dishes were the flamed cooked kobe beef, the lobster , their version of orange chicken, the black truffle explosion, the strawberry infused watermelon, the taffy balloon, and the final chocolate dessert. seriously, the desserts were so creative and delicious. overall impression  i can see why this place is so famous. the food is so unique in presentation and taste. it is fun just to see them at work. you will never have another meal like this in your life. molecular gastronomy at its finest. be prepared for the unfamiliar. if you are used to plain steak and potatoes, you have gone to the wrong place. it is not a dinner, it is an experience."

1514,Marcus C.,1130,5,9/23/14,"the magnificent display of cuisine was eyecandy. the scent of each entre was fresh and pungent. each bite was distinctive, but what they had in common was being delicious. each course was exclusive in its own way and certainly difficult to describe. sadly, i could not explain all  courses if i was asked. the meals i ended up enjoying were hot potato, black truffle, balloon, and white chocolate. the one dish i felt was distasteful was the lobster . hot potato, cold potato was the first handson course. in order for the course to be warm, our assistance was needed. once we pulled a metal prong, releasing the potato to ooze its way down, we were able to scarf it down leaving a warm sensation. next on my list, was the black truffle explosion. the name says it all. this was a brackish and briny meal that gave my tongue a tingling feeling. then it was the balloon. the balloon was filled with helium and green apple taffy that was literally floating above our table and ultimately was indeed edible. the  lobster  seemed appetizing, but from my biased opinion, it was bland. the mixture of onion and curry was displeasing to my taste buds. nevertheless, the majority of the courses were scrumptious and chef achatz's style is unique. the last course we had was seemingly dessert, which was referred to as white chocolate. the presentation for this dish was remarkable. the crushing of the chocolate sphere to wrap it up and the sprinkling of flavors was an artistic creation that tasted superb. regrettably, we were not able to make our way to the kitchen to personally meet and greet chef grant achatz. typically, this is an option offered at alinea that is usually an honorable experience. favorably, the presence of our waiter was terrific enough to make this issue go unnoticed. my personal endeavor at alinea was unexplainably breathtaking, which leads me to recommend this restaurant to everyone and rate it with  out of  stars. absolutely make your way down to alinea in chicago, illinois if you have the opportunity. it is worth the money!"
1515,Richard T.,1130,5,9/10/14,"overdue review i love alinea. yes it was expensive... very expensive, but i am glad i got the chance to try it. i loved the dining experience, and of course the food. i believe some of the items on the menu rotate. so here is what i had in may of  spoiler alert if you do not want to know what i had in case you want to be surprised, then stop reading. because even if the menu rotates, some of the items might remain the same. hot potato cold potato, black truffle, butter. very interesting concept and design. you have this waxlike spoon that holds the butter. and then you have the potato with the truffle hanging over it with some sort of contraption that requires a pin. to eat, you pull the pin off the waxed spoon, and the potato will collapse into the puddle of butter. then you shove the whole thing in your mouth. i liked it a lot because i felt two temperatures cold potato and warm truffle at once as i engulfed this appetizer. salsify branch camouflage. for this dish, our waiter pretty much made us forage for our food. i was some kind of jerky that was camouflaged inside a wreathelike basket. one of my friends actually bit into a twig or rope, thinking it was the jerky. this was a fun, interactive course. lobster  curry, earl grey, grapefruit. this meal just looks pretty and tastes good too. this dish was totally deconstructed to those ingredients i basically listed. the lobster was really fresh. sweetbreads orange, ginko nut, cinnamon chop sticks. this was presented in a chinese takeout box. if the waiter did not tell us beforehand, i would totally believe the sweetbread was orange chicken. good job fooling me! ebi broccoli stem, yuzu, sea grape. this one cleansed my palate. wagyu parsnip, black trumpet, kombu. at first it looked like just a pile of coals. the waiter lit it on fire. after a couple of minutes, the fire was extinguished and the waiter removed one coal. as you guessed, it was another camouflage. the wagyu was wrapped in kombu, so it looked like one of those coal bricks. we each had a piece of the wagyu, and it was tender and delicious. this is one of my favorite dishes in alinea. lily bulb rambutan, distillation of caviar lime. another dish that cleansed my palate. cold and fresh, i do not know how else to describe it. rhubarb celery root, celery branch, licorice. this was probably my least favorite in alinea. maybe because i do not like licorice. wood ear pig ear, allium, black garlic. very savory, and i love garlic. thumbs up! black truffle explosion, asparagus, parmesan. this is just a spoonful. but as you put the whole thing in your mouth and bite, there is literally an explosion of flavors in your mouth. please keep your mouth closed when you bite into this. this is another one of my favorites. tied with the wagyu. duck foie gras, morel, dragon's breath. it comes in a vase with a mist steaming out of it. probably dried ice, but they call it dragon breath. pretty cool though. and i love bougie foie gras. pistachio mascarpone, black walnut, rose. this one is ok with me. i do not hate it, but i am not in love with it. i am not that big on pistachio. balloon helium, green apple. the balloon is made of green apple taffy and it actually floats because of the helium. there are  ways of eating it, the fun way and the boring way. boring way pop the balloon, and chew on the taffy. fun way puncture a small hole and breathe in all the helium, then chew on the taffy at the end. we all did the fun way and sounded like chipmunks. by far the most entertaining course of our dinner hahahahaha! milk chocolate pate sucree, violet, hazelnut. the grand finale. the chefs come out for this one and builds this masterpiece for you to eat. they cleared the table and placed a brand new mat on top of it. then they started to work it was like they were painting with food. the hazelnut was very rich. each dish was a small portion, but believe me, you will be full at the end of the meal. i regret not having any pictures in this yelp review..."

1517,Lawrence P.,1130,4,6/6/14,"if you are a foodie like i am, this restaurant is certainly a must. it is truly an experience. a unique experience at that! i do not want to spoil it for anyone but there are many surprises here although i suspect that if you are going to alinea, you probably have done some research and already know what i am referring to. i will not go into detail as to the surprising presentation that this restaurant is known for. all i will say is that it is perfectly executed and the tricks do not take away from the food or experience. before i get into the food, let me comment ever so briefly about the reservation process. i absolutely love the reservation process. you purchase tickets online at alinea.com. you pick your timeslot and prepay for same. so, by the time you get there, you are pretty much prepaid, except of course for gratuity and, in our case, the wine pairing pp. easy, efficient... i wish many more restaurants would employ this reservation tactic. the food, overall, was excellent. from the scallops to the lobster to the wagyu to the duck, all were perfectly executed as was the well orchestrated service. all in all we had some  or so courses, inclusive of dessert. talking about the desserts, i did not love them, and that includes the grand finale dessert which was great in presentation but fell well short in taste. in fact, as compared to all the other star michelin restaurants i have dined at, this one fell very short in the all important sweets department. we also elected for the wine pairing. ordinarily, i am very picky of the wine i drink. so much so i take my own personal wine almost everywhere i go except alinea does not permit customers to bring their own wine so we elected to go with the pairing. it was better than most pairings i have had but not exceptional... not memorable... and there is the reason for the  stars. overall a great experience with good food and pretty good although not great wine. but even with all the originality displayed in the presentation , i did not find this dinner to be perfection in every way. i am not craving to go back although i suspect we probably will as we love to travel to chicago and my wife loved alinea. ps for a much more detailed review including pictures be sure to check out hers at brenda p i would give it . starts if i could. ps make sure you dress the part!!! jackets are required."
1518,Ivy W.,1130,2,5/31/14,"and my th review goes to alinea! alinea is the type of restaurant you go to once in your lifetime for the experience and would probably never return to again not because it is incredibly expensive, but because even though the food was good, it is not good enough to warrant a second visit for me, at least. knowing i had an upcoming business trip to chicago, i was not completely sure if i wanted to drop nearly four hundies on a meal. when i finally decided to commit and attempted to buy tickets a month in advance, the restaurant was unsurprisingly sold out for the weekend i was going to be in town. it was a big weekend and people from all over were flying in for a restaurant industry trade show, myself included, so i was not the only one interested in dining at the one of the world's  best restaurants. luckily, alinea eventually also came to this realization and decided to open their restaurant the monday following the weekend they are normally closed on mondays & tuesdays. i stalked their reservation website and managed to secure a pair of tickets for  pm. the twostory restaurant is on the small side, but by no means cramped. we arrived and opened the nondescript front door to a long hot pinklit hallway. halfway down, sleek doors to our left slid open and a host greeted us. even though we were minutes early, we were seated immediately and i was glad we got our evening started earlier than planned. the decor is simple and understated to highlight the molecular gastronomy. hanging above each table was a vegetable, which we thought was strange but i do not want to spoil any surprises. let us just say every little thing, down to the details, serves a purpose. course tasting menu  pp hot potato, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ salsify, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ lobster , yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ sweetbreads, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ ebi, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ wagyu, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ lily bulb, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ rhubarb, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ wood ear, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ black truffle, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ duck, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ pistachio, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ balloon, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ chocolate cake birthday, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ milk chocolate, yelp.combiz_photosalinÄ the courses were either a hit or miss for me. unfortunately, i did not particularly care for nor like most of them, especially the ebi and lily bulb i had to force this down. however, my favorites were definitely the hot potato, lobster , and wagyu as i love contrast in textures and flavors, and these three were just that. all four desserts were fantastic and so fun, especially the balloon! the presentation for all the courses, plus the added element of surprise you do not know the menu beforehand, really made the overall meal much more unique, interactive, and memorable  even if i did not like all of the dishes. you truly use all your senses at alinea. service a bit uptight and to be honest, i did not feel  comfortable. our server and sommelier would stand off to the side, whisper to another, then chuckle, or share glances over our table and smirk after presenting courses to us throughout the night. maybe it did not have anything to do with us, maybe it did. either way, i cannot say it was the most pleasant service. they were nice, but that was it. the host should also smile more  while i waited for the restroom and peered into the kitchen, i asked him a couple of questions about operations and chef achatz for the sake of conversation, but he was unfriendly, cold, and abrupt with his answers. not the type of service i expected, especially when i am paying this much for a meal. michelin  stars  world's  best no.  "
1519,Scarlet W.,1130,5,5/27/14,"oh, alinea...you were the reason that i decided to go to chicago for memorial day weekend, and you will be the reason that i decide to go back. you set the bar so high that you made next restaurant from the night before look like your little brother that tried so hard to live up to expectations but was ultimately outclassed in every way. every course was executed to perfection. there was no because for any complaint. i waited with excitement and anticipation for every course, and every course was delivered with rich flavors and exquisite presentation. i could not help but peek at all of the diners around us that were further ahead in their meal, waiting for spoilers. the standouts were  lobster with curry, earl grey, and grapefruit sweetbreads with orange, ginko nut, and cinnamon chopsticks wagyu beef lily bulb with rambutan and distillation of caviar lime duck with foie gras, morel, and dragon's breath blueberry with bubblegum, lilac, and sorrel i could not choose just a few because all of those courses were incredible. and of course, not to be overshadowed, the green apple balloon and milk chocolate dessert courses were phenomenal. it was especially exciting to have chef grant achatz come over to our table to create our final dessert course. he seemed very focused, and the result was a delicious masterpiece."
1520,Elena N.,1130,5,5/12/14,"definitely a once in a lifetime experience! i have been wanting to go to alinea since my last chicago trip back in . this time i decided to make it happen and planned accordingly. we had a pm table on wednesday . tickets for the tasting were  each and the wine pairing was . all prices were subject to tax and  service charge. hot potato  cold potato, black truffle, butter. was on the best thing i ever ate on the food network. hot and cold potato with truffle all taken like a shot from a wax cup! wine pairing  champagne guiborat blancs des blancs brut nv salsify  branch camouflage. an interactive course. we got to forage for our food! lobster  curry, earl grey, grapefruit. all the lovely sauces paired wonderfully with the lobster . wine pairing  vin de pays de l'herault mas jullien  sweetbreads  orange, ginko nut, cinnamon chopsticks. this was a play on chinese takeout. this came in a chinese take out box wrapped in a plastic bag with cinnamon chopsticks! wine pairing  vrouvray tendre domaine du viking  ebi  celtuce, yuzu, sea grape. all on a kombu chip! a great little bite! wagyu  parsnip, black trumpet, kombu. this was brought out as a little table decor, then lit on fire. finally revealed as a charred parsnip and wagyu! wine pairing  sato no homare pride of the village junnai ginjoshu, sudo honke shuzo. ibarakiken. lily bulb  rambutan, distillation of caviar lime. this was our palette cleanser. i was not a huge fan of this. the lily bulbs were a little too strong and the serving was a little too much for an intermezzo. rhubarb  celery root, celery branch, licorice. my least favorite course of the night. there was rhubarb hanging above us the when we sat down which was shaved on top of this dish. it was too sweet and too strong. even though the serving was small, i could not bring myself to finish it. wine pairing  matthiasson rose, california  wood ear  pig ear, allium, garlic. when they dug up the wagyu from the fire, i was actually expecting pig. we finally got some! wine pairing  crozes hermitage cuvee gaby domaine du colombier  black truffle  explosion, asparagus, parmesan. my favorite dish of the night! i could have eaten several of them they were so good! our server told us this is what the chef served to his investors to convince them to invest in this restaurant. i understand why they said yes! duck  foie gras, morel, dragon's breath. i love to eat duck! but they kind of scare me aesthetically so the duck vessel holding the foie and dumplings was not my fav. regardless i did enjoy this dish. wine pairing  ricardo esponoza antiyal valle de maipo  pistachio  mascarpone, black walnut, rose. i did not really care for this dessert. there was a salty element in the ice cream that just ruined the whole dish for me. wine pairing  chateau tirecul la graviere les pins monbazillac  balloon  helium, green apple. such a fun course! you suck out all the helium, talk like a chipmunk and then eat the balloon and string! milk chocolate  pate sucree, violet, hazelnut. i cannot even describe how awesome it was to watch them make this dessert! this is definitely a treat! wine pairing  maculan torcolato breganze  i was kind of hesitant about buying the tickets for the p reservation since it was such an early time to have dinner, but it was cheaper so i decided to go for it. in the end i am glad i did cuz everything was a surprise for us. we were the first ones to get every dish! the wine flowed freely. if i ran out or drank my whole glass of wine, they would happily refill it so i had some for the rest of the course or next. there were a couple courses that did not quite gel for me, but overall, i think alinea is one of the better three michelin star restaurants i have been to. i would definitely recommend alinea to anyone looking to splurge since this really was such a unique dining experience!"
1521,B K.,1130,5,4/3/14,"i have wanted to go to alinea since it is opening and was lucky enough to go last night with a great friend. what an experience. from the moment you walk in down the darkly lit hall and the opening sliding doors, you know you are someplace special. the staff pays attention to every detail and explains everything from the hanging rhubarb above the table, to the exquisitely arranged plate of lobster with curry and cubes of jellied perfection. and the wine parings whether you choose regular or reserve are amazing in the balance with the food in front of you. each course is amazing and creative, and when they serve the helium inflated balloons made of a wonderful sugary substance, i thought that was the end, but not... then they put a silicon tablecloth down so they can paint your dessert of chocolate and crumbs and violet sauce artistry that for one second you think, should i eat this  yes, you should, as it is just as amazing. if you get the opportunity to experience alinea do! it is an experience you will cherish."
1522,Brenda P.,1130,5,3/12/14,"if you have a reservation at alinea in the near future, i suggest you stop reading all the yelp spoilers. i know, i know. i am usually the first one that just has to know what to always expect. my only suggestion is to look up what the building exterior looks like or you might miss it. other than that, do not ruin it. i am warning you. stop. look away. for the rest of you, i still will not spoil it completely. i refuse to. arrived promptly at pm. the building is unmarked. no name. no clue. we entered into a mauve tunnel and about  steps in, magic doors opened unexpectedly into the unknown. we spotted the hostess and cheerfully greeted her. she stared us down and after an awkward  second pause she announced we were expecting you an hour ago. shit. what was she talking about? turns out, she was correct. i doubted her at first because i am a sticklet for reservations. alas, once i checked my confirmation emai, i saw she was correct. we will still be able to honor your reservation, she finally and icily said. my heart sunk. i waited for this reservation for over a month! i would have been so sad had we left then. i am not sure why we confused the times. i apologized, but she was not caving. we were escorted up to our table on the nd floor. one of our many waiters came by and assured us it was ok despite the last seating being then. thankfully, everything was smooth sailing from then on. our dinner was prepaid. we purchased tickets online instead of reserving the traditional way. they do things differently here. tip follow them on facebooktwitter. they always announce when the tickets are on sale and you have a better chance at snagging a reservation. the dinner consisted of  small courses. you have to know that almost everything at alinea has a surprise factor. the attention to detail is astounding. everything has a purpose every plate, utensil, setting, etc.. once there, we decided to add the wine pairing to our dinner as well. although i did not love every single pairing as in, i would never have it outside of alinea, each one paired perfectly with its course. my favorites were the selbachoster riesling kabinett surprisingly so, the sato no homare sake, and the chateau tirecul a graviere. without giving all the details away, i will say that my favorite courses were the scallops, lobster , wagyu, hot potato, and duck. those were all delicious! my least favorites were the pistachio dessert and lily bulbs. yes, i ate flowers. i also inhaled helium, and had a course called  ........?????............!!!!!!!!!!!!!  . i laughed, i mmm would and had a memorable night. for the skeptics like me, this was surprisingly enjoyable. i am usually not a fan of gimmicky restaurants. i can even go as far as compare this to a similar one i recently dined at and another  michelin star one which i detested you can read about it here yelp.combiztherestaurÄ while meadowood left me mentally and physically starved, alinea did not. are you going to roll out of there stuffed? probably not! you will, however, leave there satisfied and with a better understanding of high end cuisine and it is intricate techniques. i am so humbled i was able to experience it and feel like a better diner now because of it. service was wonderful. i will say this too do not dine at alinea if you do not have a sense of humor and an understanding of sarcasm. with the exception of our frowning hostess, the staff was all witty, sharp, focused, professional and full of one liners. it worked beautifully with our party. it also works flawlessly with this kind of food where delivery and presentation are key factors! i would love to be a fly on the wall during the hiring and training process. do they train them at the improv? i lost count on how many waiters we had all night for each course. i saw at least  different ones who presented a course and interacted with us. i was actually sad when i realized it was over. i felt like it should have been  courses longer. i hesitantly pushed my chair back and left. unfortunately, alinea is not the kind of place you can return to immediately. i would think you need to let some time pass and wait for them to switch their menu around. i do plan to hopefully return in a couple of years. next time though, i will triple confirm my reservation time. i would not want to get the death stare from that hostess again. ha! i kid. i will be on time though. promise."
1523,Jon B.,1130,3,2/8/14,"let me start by saying that alinea's ticketingreservation process is not something i am a fan of. every restaurant makes money by turning tables. alinea makes money by preselling seats and does not allow refunds. stuff happens, however. parents of a young child cannot find a babysitter and are forced to bring him.   tax, tip and wine times two is a lot of money. my original dining partner became ill the night before our reservation. i called the next day to see if rescheduling was a possibility. it was not, and yes, i was aware of refundsrescheduling not being possible. tough luck, i suppose. this is an issue that should be addressed. the french laundry has a  deposit. enough ranting onto why people go there. entering the door i immediately smelled anise. it was pleasant. i do not want to give too much info, there are a lot of surprises throughout your dining experience. i brought a bottle of wine along, not to be opened but was hoping chef achatz was in and able to sign it. it was a bottle where he was an assistant wine maker at la jota in napa valley. he did sign it and i was extremely thankful for it. my guest and i were seated upstairs and were warmly welcomed. not giving away too much, the decor looked like a high end lounge in the star trek universe. i had let a service representative know that i had a food allergy after buying tickets. the initial server acknowledged my food allergy and let me know that they would accommodate me. we were asked if we wanted wine. i was reluctant. i am a wine snob, but i really did not feel like spending more coin than i already have for this experience. onto the food! we started with an amuse bouche of arctic char roe, banana pudding, passion fruit foam and ginger. my bouche was amused. highly flavorful, lots of textures and everything in balance. great start. next a scallop dish served amazingly that involved all of our senses. it was a beautiful dish that i should not spoil for an next was lobster with curry, an intense earl grey syrup and grapefruit. the curry was awesome and ended up bringing some home with me as it ended up on my shirt. super tasty dish. at this point in the meal i wondered if we were getting the oyster leaf that i have read a lot of amazing reviews. it did not come. huge bummer. next was wagyu with parsnip, black trumpet and kombu. i will not spoil how this was presented. it was a gorgeous, flavorful and extremely memorable. as much as i liked it, i do not think wagyu, in general is worth its weight. i had properly cooked a grade wagyu at lo a couple of years ago, and it was underwhelming. sweetbreads done in the style of orange chicken was next. this was an excellent dish with intense orange and mustard flavors. there was also a black garlic jus that was mouth coating and rich. awesome dish. hot potato playful showcase of contrasting temperatures in a dish. it was a nifty presentation that was full of truffled goodness. duck here is where things got crazy tasty.  different preparations for duck with  different accompaniments.there was anything from olives to a port wine reduction to a menthol jelly. lots of odd combos and many worked well. the foie gras pate was probably the most memorable bite of the evening. ginger a palate cleanser, very flavorful, refreshing, spicy and enjoyable. and i do not like ginger that much. at this point i was concerned about not getting the truffle explosion that i have read many reviews on. another gigantic disappointment. pumpkin i was not sad too long after the first dessert dish. this was nearly on par with coffee and doughnuts from the french laundry. unctuous, not overly sweet and another awesome bite. pistachio served with toasted pistachios, pistachio gelato, black walnut cake, mascarpone and strawberry something. the black walnut cake was floral and very surprising. the pistachio components were absolutely awesome. i saw the strawberry component on the plate, i am not sure if it was meringue or what. i did explain that it was the seeds i was allergic to. once the plate arrived, they did not say, hey, this does not have strawberry seeds in it, dig in! this dish was awesome without trying the strawberry anyway. balloon a green apple balloon with an edible string floated to our table. it was good, not great. think green apple laffy taffy. milk chocolate chef achatz assembled an edible masterpiece in front of my guest and i. hot chocolate, butterscotch, a cracker crust, hazelnut, violet syrup and frozen milk finished our meal. the hot chocolate was good, not as pleasant as everything else was. while he was making the dessert, i wanted to thank him for an excellent meal, but i fangirled and failed to say a word to him. is alinea the best meal i have had? no.  per person without wine for was not worth the coin. flavors were amazing. service was nearly flawless, warm and friendly. it was an epic meal, but probably will not be returning.

1525,Jackie H.,1130,1,7/22/16,"i have lived a very blessed life to be able to say alinea was one of my biggest disappointments. so. much. hype. i knew i would have to try alinea at some point in my  years in chicago. the  months of renovations made me nervous i would not make it in time but the stars aligned & i had a table for  on the saturday night of my graduation weekend, the ideal culmination of my time in business school & chicago. meant to be. but then.. i mean.. everyone is helllllla reluctant to say anything bad about this place after paying one thousand dollars ,.. literally. for  person dinner with wine pairings cuz it is painful enough to she will out that kinda money & then to have to admit you wasted all that money on the most ehhhh of meals.. but i am going to break this down & tell you this place was not worth it at all. at all. true story i went to white castle for the first time the next day & thought that was a better meal than alinea. do that instead. first & foremost, i did not like the food. i am a fancy bitch & it is not like i did not like it cuz it was unfamiliar or different, it actually all tasted kinda subpar. the combinations & flavors were wack. lamb was so so gamey, ugh! another example dish of morels. it was like a cereal bowl of morels in a cream sauce. i thought it was one of the laziest, most unpleasant dishes on the menu. i like morels but after a few the texture starts seeming creepy & it gets too heavy & makes you kinda gag. gross. i had not been there before the renovations so i cannot compare. but here are a few other things that were fucking annoying about this new alinea experien no surprises. you are getting served your meal in a room of other tables also getting their meals duh, right? except it is the fucking worst cuz all the tables are getting different dishes at different times. so my reservation was at  apparently they had tables at , , &  as well cuz i could see all the damn dishes that were going to come after the one i was eating cuz the tables across from us were getting them already!! goddammit, i thought the surprise was part of the whole fucking point!! no surprises!! one silver lining with a table behind us in the lineup meant i could listen again to the description of the food cuz they just kept blowing through them all no directions. i am not accustomed to being served a beautiful plate of abstract shit just sprawled across it so i do not know how to eat it. staff was sooooooooo hohum & i had to ask every. single. dish.. sooo.. how do you.. eat.. this..? stop making me feel like an asshole. found out afterwards that this new alinea postrenovation is encouraging guests to eat it however they want. you know what though? that is really fucking unhelpful cuz i do not know how to eat whatever this thing is & you just gave the description in one breath rushed, abrupt, incomplete, unsatisfactory staff sucked. mentioned it already but the staff was incredibly blas. like maybe they got used to  months of not doing that damn thing but the service was kinda clunky different servers asking each other things & shooting the shit & the attitude was very eh. indifferent, casual, just whateverz. even if it was mcdonald's i would be like, not that nice but whatever. but for this caliber of a restaurant?? eye rolling, smirking, not at alllll polished. new staff as soon as possible pls i am giving it  star cuz the plates were pretty, i will give them that. but none of that cool drawing dessert on your table or aromatic experience some wood chip burning thing might have been planned as an aromatic experience but i am not sure cuz . i did not smell anything & . the staff did not tell me about it that i was super super hyped about. soooooooooo disappointing."
1526,Shelli U.,1130,4,11/29/15,"great food & experience but not as good as the st time we dined there yrs ago. alinea always impresses with the fresh and unique food pairings that look like art, impeccable service, perfect wine pairings by john. if you have never been, it is definitely worth splurging once in your life but i am not sure we will go back. this time, the service was just as good as we remembered but the food did not wow us the same way as the st time and surprisingly both my husband and i were hungry a few hours later and for this price, we thought that should not be the case. our favorite dish was the dashi & barnacles unique, beautifully presented and tasty and nd was the lamb dish."
1527,Luke L.,1130,5,11/13/15," th review, st time trying out michelin star restaurant  each foodie has hisher list of dream upscale dining restaurants from the french laundry in napa valley to eleven madison park in new york however, i never thought this day would actually come ... it is one thing to dream and drool about the list, but it is another thing to pay a total of . and fly all the way to chicago just to try it. overall, alinea was not necessary the best meal, but rather the best dining experience i have ever enjoyed. alina is one of the two threestar michelin restaurants in chicago as of , ranked no.  on  world's  best restaurants ranked no.  in , and received aaa five diamond award. in addition, chef grant achatz one of time magazine's  most influential people in  & winner of james beard outstanding chef in  was diagnosed w stage  tongue cancer back in , but he is now cancer free.  reservation & dress code  follow alinea on twitter and it will send out a tweet when tickets begin to go on sale typically between  am to  am pst on the th of each month & you can only book a party of , , or . you have about less than  to  hours before most time slots are filled, so plan accordingly. i would get the earliest reservation time e.g.  pm so other tables will not ruin the surprises. for men, bring a jacket and no casual wear e.g. jeans, tshirts or tennis shoes.  price & valet parking  for sat  pm dinner, it was . per person  base price   service charge  . taxes however, the base price varies depending on date and time e.g. sunday is cheaper than saturday & early  pm dinner is cheaper than  pm dinner. you will have to pay separately for wine pairings &  for valet parking.  tips & other information  alinea specializes in molecular gastronomy and please expect this ~ courses to last ~ hours i finished the entire thing in approximately  hours w  minutes break bw each course & wo wine pairings. if you are planning to come here, then do not look at any pictures because they will ruin all the surprises. if you do not care, then keep reading.  warning  spoilers ahead  impeccable service  it starts the moment you step into the alinea's boundary and the staff will escort you till the very end. i embarrassed myself by taking used fork & knife and putting them back to where i grabbed it. fancy complimentary volcanic water sant aniol  not sparkling & all my friend did was chugging the water.  food  apple cider from norwegian it was stirred w rose stem tasted very crisp. peach [basil, murray river salt] icy ball sealed w peach juice  very interesting texture. bocadillo [bread, jamon iberico, manchego] & gilda [guindilla de ibarra, anchovy, olive] & patatas bravas [paprika, chile, garlic] these three cubes tasted exactly like what i saw in the pictures  talk about food engineering at its best. strawberry [tomato, pumpernickel, burrata] soup tasted like dashi w weird bobalike texture and not to mention tomato looked like strawberry, but tasted like tomato and vise versa. another interesting visual trick. brook trout [uchiki kuri squash, thai banana, blis] new course and unfortunately i thought it tasted ok. graffiti [matsutake, maitake, parsley] whoa  i actually thought those were actually bricks those were actually crackers  delicious meltinyourmouth crackers. daikon [smoke, seawater, ash] & tororo kombu [hamachi, ice fish cracker] & unagi [pickled plum, white sesame] & corn [miso, nori, togarashi] corn was decent, but hamachi tasted delicious and crispy  probably one of the best hamachi i have had. chicken [shishito, lily, kombu] charcoal was used to fire tea kettle and somehow charcoal turned into chicken w a touch of lily and shishito pepper. it was definitely one of a kind presentation. hot potato [cold potato, black truffle, butter] i pulled off the metal stick and ate the entire thing in one attempt. it was cool, but it did not taste as good as other courses. olive cake [extra virgin olive oil, black pepper] i hate olive, but i thought olive cake was pretty good no strong bitter taste! lamb [caper leaf, grapes, olives] not very memorable. parsnip [honey truffle, vanilla, orange] this had the most complex flavors  the mouthfeel from diet coke, sourness from sauce, and garlicky flavor all combined into one. balloon [helium, green apple] i sucked some of helium and my voice actually changed for few seconds. think the balloon as green apple flavor bubble gum filled w helium. my friend did not kiss the balloon properly and all helium just dissipated to the atmosphere. tropical fruit [rum, vanilla, kaffir lime] final course and grand finale  one minute of dazzling dessert show.good frozen coconut and interesting mix of mango, passion fruit, and chocolate sauces.  alina is a onceinalifetime experience and that is all there is to it."
1528,Lamling P.,1130,1,11/13/15,"the worst michelin starred experience ever. this is the th michelin starred restaurant i have been to all around the world. service was terrible, the wine list was finally given to me after i asked for it three times. we ordered apple cider at the beginning and never saw it even after we left. some dishes were disgusting, notably the olive cakes, lamb chop, gilda and patatas bravas. even the first course, a chocolate she will pop, in comparison with the same dish from other michelin restaurant, does not meet our expectation. some dishes brought too much smoke in a closed environment making us extremely uncomfortable. i really do not think the restaurant deserves such a fame across the country, it is actually even worse than most of the bib gourmand restaurants in chicago."
1529,Dan M.,1130,5,10/6/15,"alinea is more than a meal it is a dining experience. as soon as you walk in the door you enter another world where art and world come together in perfect unison. a meal at alinea is one of those rare meals that will inspire your mind and stick with you for a life time. alinea is best experienced when you know as little as possible so the experience can be truly personal. avoid spoilers, therefore stop reading if you want to make the best of your night. as soon as you walk in the door the tone for the entire experience is set by a red lit hallway that tappers at the end. as you move down the hall a large sliding door automatically opens, ushering you into another world. you walk in the door and immediately you are greeted by a smiling man in a suit. he welcomes you with instructions to hang out near the glass wall and study the kitchen. you stand there, entranced by the eerily quiet but busy kitchen. the man in the suit says it is time to move to the table. over the table a shishito pepper and lilly hang, creating a shadow that resembles a hummingbird. in the center of the table sits a carafe containing mint, rosemary, and orange peel. the man in the suit pours sparkling wine into the carafe as part of the first drink pairing. peach with basil and murray river salt is a frozen ball containing peach juice that bursts into sweet liquidy goodness when places in your mouth. suddenly the man in the suit reaches over and pours the contents of the carafe over the frozen crystals the peach orb had been sitting on. there is a frozen cocktail staring you in the face, uncertain but containing freeze dried avino cava reserva penedes, pacharan sierra de orduna, rhine hall apple brandy. the second course, bites inspired by spanish tapas. to you they seem like something out of science fiction. an entire meal in one bite! bite , bocadillo with bread, jamon iberico, manchego! bite , gilda with guindilla de ibarra, anchovy, olive! bite , patatas bravas with paprika, chile, garlic enter stage left, dish number , strawberry with tomato, pumpernickel, burrata. the dish looks like a simple tomato, strawberry, some bread crumbs, and some cheese. at a glance, you would be wrong. both the strawberry and tomato are actually gels. the strawberry tastes like a tomato and the tomato tastes like a strawberry. your mind is blown apart from the inside out. truly innovative and really makes you think about your tendency to eat with your eyes first. a smoking fourth dish slams down on the table like some kind of fusion between halloween and spring time. the smell of chamomile and flowers hits you in the face. the man in the suit says char roe with english pea, olive oil, chamomile. at the bottom of the bowl there are several gels including jalapeno and some roe. each element was interesting on its own but when mixed paired flawlessly. dish number five, graffiti consists of matsutake and maitake mushrooms served on concrete slabs. the dish is tagged with parsley puree. to you, the street art inspiration has been made clear. never before has a mushroom tasted so good. the sixth course is comprised of several elements. unagi with pickled plum, white sesame corn with uni, nori, togarashi tororo kombu with hamachi, ice fish cracker percebes with smoke, seawater, ash the last element is served on a piece of driftwood covered in seaweed. the only thing you are instructed to eat is the four tiny barnacles. each part of the course brings forward sharp images of the salty sea. you suddenly realize the next dish had been sitting in front of you all along in the flames. the chicken and daikon were wrapped in seaweed roasting in the fire. it was unwrapped and prepared at the table by the man in the suit. the sauce was in the tea kettle and was poured over the course. a tiny white orb arrives at the table. the man in the suit says its name is, hot potato with cold potato, black truffle, and butter. this dish was time sensitive with both cold and hot elements. the pin was pulled out of the dish, dropping the cold potato into the hot butter. incredible mouth feel of contrasting hot and cold elements. next a vase of bay leaves is placed on the table with olive cake with extra virgin olive oil, black pepper sitting a top the leaves. it is served with  lamb  with caper leaf, grapes, olives. this dish was paired with oliver cake, which made for perfect sauce enjoyment. one of the last dishes, as your night winds down, parsnip with honey truffle, vanilla, orange paired sweet and savory elements perfectly. you never will look at a parsnip the same again. a tart lemon balloon arrives at the table. it is made of lemon candy and filled with helium. you suck the helium out of the candy and devour the lemon sweet goodness. for the grand finale, tropical fruit. this dish was plated directly on the table with a variety of sauces all spice, mango, rum. you leave but cannot seem to shake the experience, numb."

1531,Mitch F.,1130,3,1/20/15,"overall i could not have been more excited to eat here and knew what i was getting into. i tempered my expectations so i did not go in expecting the best meal of my life. in the end it was a really memorable experience and one that i am glad i have got to say i have done. but the food itself was definitely a let down. i feel like alinea has transitioned into the 'touristy' worldclass dining establishment now, where it is mostly show and the cache of eating there and they know they can give less, cut corners with cost, and still be full every night and make more profit. service it was fantastic. just laid back and nice, friendly people. somm was awesome for the wine pairings and descriptions. the whole flow of the evening was great. we did not feel rushed one bit as some people have been saying. our dinner was exactly  hours. food i just cannot believe i am saying it, but there just were not many dishes that we felt were standouts. a few real high points, but a lot of forgettable dishes. we all agreed that sixteen and girl and the goat both blew alinea out of the water in terms of overall taste. meat i am not a huge eater and i rarely, if ever, complain about the size of portions, but i feel like alinea should be embarrassed with their meat offerings. look at what was served to diners in the past, with the lamb  or duck!!! as the main entree course. impressive and substantial. now it is a piece of squab that i kid you not is either  large bites or  small ones. and it is pretty pedestrian in flavor as well. the only other meat was a small piece of pork belly that was probably  bites as well. it was good but have definitely had better. the lack of a star protein really hurts the overall meal. it transitions to desert not with a bang, but a really sad whimper. so, if you can afford it, go and say you have been to a restaurant that once was considered the best in the world. but go now because i do not think people will be saying that for too many more years."
1532,Isabel B.,1130,3,7/20/14,"if you are going to spend a boatload of money on dinner in chicago and love it, go to grace. i did not like the reservation system or being charged for dinner and gratuity in advance. it is cheeky and presumes a lot. that and the adherence to a single tasting menu are for the benefit of the restaurant's bottom line, not the guest. but you read the reviews and you think, it must be worth it. you arrive and walk down the red corridor, automatic sliding doors allow you a glimpse into the kitchen's operating room atmosphere. serious business. the decor is spare and contemporary. then the lecture begins  ...here is the pillow for your utensils. chef does not like table cloths. put your dirty utensils on the plate, not the pillow. keep the pillow clean...  each and every course is explained in a business like tone by the staff who has uttered each description hundreds of times. things such as you will notice inside the decoy... roll off their tongue and hit your ear like nonsense. every course comes with a long list of instructions, caveats and suggestions. they hide some fruit jerky strip in a bunch of twigs  look for it! i laughed out loud. as a waiter in a competing restaurant said, do they make the choo choo train noise as they feed you too? what happened to just eating great food?  each and every wine pour is also accompanied by a meticulously crafted script from which there is no deviation. they must have to study their lines every night, poor dears. one waiter mentioned boasted? complained? that the wait staff routinely put in  hour days. what with rehearsals and all...  because everyone in the room is having the exact same menu, you will hear all of these descriptions at least a half dozen times during your meal. said in exactly the same way. echolinea.  unless a nearby table gets something extra from the kitchen. then you will feel left out.  in between their lines, the staff is nice and jokey. the food is the show flair at the cost of flavor and there are no surprises unless you are the first in your room to receive each course. and the food is fine, often bland, sometimes great. the lamb and wagyu beef were not great. they should be great. the indian inspired dish has many elements but no spice. they rely far too heavily on powdered ingredients. lots of smoke. and mirrors. the overall experience was, as others have said, once in a lifetime, but only because i would not want to repeat it."
1533,Verlee G.,1130,5,3/3/13,"traveling to chicago last october, it was a must that i had to make ressies at alinea. it was the first time they rolled out doing the ticketing system online, and boy  did that process have me stressed out. i had no idea when tickets were going live since it was the first time releasing tickets for augustseptoctober. luckily, i was able to snag one of their last seatings at pm because when it rolled out live, i was an hour late in the shower of course after constantly checking online. enough of the ticketing system, the experience and staff were awesome and not at all pretentious. pretty laid back, actually.  as soon as you first walk through the stealth door, to the end where they are handing you the menu, it was an impeccable time. everything was prepared beautifully. some dishes stood out more than others of course. sometimes i had to just laugh out loud what they were putting in front of me  almost comical like the wooden plank with algae for the sea urchinlobsterrazor clam dish. my favorites were the otoro, brook trout, the black truffle, and the lamb served three ways. i felt like a mad scientist trying out the  different sides to play with. and when would you ever eat a green apple helium balloon? so much fun. lots of people ask me if it was worth the money and if they should go. yes, definitely. it is not just for the food, it is for the fun, the amazement, the experience."
1534,Fei W.,1130,5,1/14/13,"hmm... best thing i ever ate? check. most creative presentationplating i have ever experienced? check. just walking into alinea is an experience in itself. the door is fairly nondescript, and upon entering, it is a dimly lit tunnel flanked by pine trees. not sure if this is just a winter thing or an all year thing, but it definitely gives a fell down the rabbit hole or accidentally walked into narnia type feel. a set of automatic sliding doors leads you into the famed restaurant itself. to the right is the kitchen where i saw grant achatz lording over his kingdom. we were greeted upon entry with the first course of hot chocolate, abinao, smoke, spruce. what are those things? could not tell you. when the hostess asked for the name on our reservation, i was tempted to say, oh, we just wanted to put our name on the list. how long is the wait? somehow, i restrained myself. now for the food. there were many courses and most people have reviewed them in depth, so i will just mention the ones that really blew me away halibut, mole, avocado, escabeche  holy mother of best thing i ever put in my mouth! there was a bone marrow accompaniment that gave this dish an unreal level of richness and flavor. hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter  this was a timesensitive bite that required dropping the potato and huge slice of truffle into the waiting butter sauce and then taken as a shooter. um, please sir, can i have some more? black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan  so this is served with a bowl that has no bottom. literally, there is a hole that confused me at first as the dark color of the table made me think there was sauce at the bottom i was supposed to scoop up. this is a single bite of truffle decadence. dark chocolate, chestnut, rye, birch syrup  presentation. if you have not youtubed a video of this, do it. or be surprised because it is one of the most artistic presentations of food i have ever experienced. it also tastes pretty effing good. honorable mention is the lamb .. ..???? ... ...!!!!!!! the different cuts of lamb are cooked to perfection and it is served with a palette of  different flavors for you to play with. why the honorable mention? well, the palette of flavors looked gorgeous and had some great flavors, but it was a little overwhelming. and it was hard to try all of them with the lamb . still a delicious offering, but did not make the cut of best thing ever. #diva. everything else was delicious and beautifully plated but did not leave quite the impression that those did. our servers were excellent and did not take things too seriously. it was a very comfortable atmosphere and well worth the price tag. if you want to complain about the ticketing system... well i cannot stop you. but it probably means you are behind the technological times. it is now much easier and relatively painfree besides the hole in wallet to get a seat at this establishment. learn how to use facebook or twitter, or pay a kid to monitor it for you. on second thought, what are you even doing on yelp if you are that technologically challenged?"
1535,Jake W.,1130,5,1/12/13,"i cannot imagine that any review you read here is going to sway one to come here or not. if you want to go, it is very expensive and you have to pay in adavance. it is all extremely interesting, awesome presentation and very delicious. the menu changes, but i can give the list of what i got. hot chocolate while we waited. was actually really good. we got blocks of ice that were hollowed out with spices at the bottom. they poured hot tea in and we drank it out with big straws. excellent presentation, decent tea. the next was a group of sea food. a leaf that tasted like a clam weird that it tasted like clam, but good, razor clam  good, lobster claw  excellent and sea urchin with white chocolate and wasabi that was awesome. the next dish was in a fishbowl that was otoro with thai banana, sea salt and lime. really cool presentation again and pretty tasty. then we got a spread of corn. the presentation was based on the artwork in the dining room. it was sweet, crunchy, soft and salty all at once. one of my favorites. after that we got an arctic char, which came out on a two by four with lit charcoal underneath keeping it warm. the skin was still on and crispy. delicious. the next was a potato ball with truffle on top. it came on a skewer and was good, but did not blow me away. after that was was a matsutake mushroom with pork, huckleberry and pine. it came on stones that were under a group of pine needles. excellent and i am not even a huge mushroom fan. next was a black truffle ravioli. awesome. so delicious. i could have eaten ten. the next dish was my favorite. it was three pieces of lamb . all three were prepared differently and they would not tell us what they were specifically. then, they gave the table a tray with about  toppings, each one different. we chose one for each piece of lamb  could have been a sauce, an herb, fruit, etc. so cool. everyone had something different. could not use all the toppings, but wish i could have. the next was a woodcock dumpling. it came on a stem with a burning leaf on the end. the smell of the burning leaf was nice and the dumpling was awesome. the woodcock was tender and juicy and the skin was thin and crispy. the last dish before dessert was ginger. we got five metal skewers, each with a piece of ginger prepared in a different way. i am not a big ginger fan, but they were all very interesting. my friend loved ginger and she loved it. the first dessert was the most fun dish of the night. it was a green apple flavored helium balloon. green apple is my favorite candy flavor and this was nice and sticky and chewy. it was fun to hear everyone talk in the helium voice as we ate. the last dessert had the best presentation. two chefs came out and painted a design on the table of sauces and bits of chocolate. the design, like the corn, was reminiscent of the art on the wall. in the middle of the table the whole time were two frozen chocolate coconut sized balls. after designing the table, they smashed the chocolate balls which were full of ice cream and some other goodies. awesome presentation and delicious. overall, good food and great experience. glad i came. something i will never forget."
1536,Scott L.,1130,5,1/8/13,"they say bmw is the ultimate driving experience, well alinea is the ultimate dining experience. first of all you do not need a reservation, you need to purchase tickets when they go on sale. the ticket price is the price of your meal so the only thing you have to pay for when your dinner is complete are for drinks. tax & gratuity is also included in the ticket price. the wine list is extensive and if you need help deciding on a wine to compliment your dinner, one of the sommelier can assist. our dinner was in november and the tasting menu was as follows macintosh apple cider butternut oyster leaf sea urchin lobster razor clam otoro corn arctic char hot potatocold potato matsutake black truffle lamb woodcock giner carrot ballon dark chocolate this probably does not mean anything to anyone that may read this review. in fact it probably is not very helpful. you have to experience alinea to appreciate what chef grant achatz has put together. he is truly a pioneer and leader in molecular gastronomy. overall alinea is the ultimate dinning experience and the service is impeccable."
1537,Joanne W.,1130,5,1/3/13,"alinea has been on my list for quite some time and i am happy to report that i am finally able to cross this place off my list! is alinea the best meal i have ever had? quite possibly. is it the best dining experience, i have ever had? absolutely. alinea lives up to the hype in my opinion and is something not to be missed if you can swing it. for me it was a once in a lifetime experience and i will always remember it. stand outs for me were black truffle explosion, hot potatocold potato, smoked morels morels that were planted and harvested after a burn giving these fungi a nice smokey flavor. seriously!, assorted seafood crab, lobster, razor clam, oyster leaf which were served on this cool vessel made of seaweed, the taffy balloon and the white chocolate bomb desserts. i also enjoyed the lamb dish served with  different components for you to experiment with. the presentation is spectacular. so inventive, each course is a work of art. it is truly an experience for the senses. surprisingly, alinea is not pretentious. our servers were great, laid back and throwing back the jokes with us. there is not a lot i can say that has not already been said so i will end my review with a quote by virginia woolf. one cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. and i did."
1538,Sarah S.,1130,5,12/29/12,"review # has been reserved for the best meal of my life, hands down worth the cost, it excels in every possible way. alinea is sleek and chic without making you feel out of your element or uncomfortable with the modern class of the restaurant. from start to finish, the service and food astonished me. every course was an exploration for my tastebuds of new combinations and interesting twists on food i had never experienced before. as a broke foodie, this was the best example of food as art i have ever seen. i know, i know, i am gushing like a school girl over the cute boy in science class but alinea is pretty damn hot. rundown of our night together course  steelhead roe coconut, curry, carrot course  oyster leaf mignonette course  king crab passionfruit, heart of palm, allspice course  mussel saffron, chorizo, oregano course  razor clam shiso, soy, daikon course  woolly pig fennel, orange, squid course  scallop acting like agedashi tofu course  hamachi thai banana, sea salt, kaffir lime course  burn morels ramps, fiddlehead fern, miner's lettuce course  hot potato cold potato, black truffle, butter course  lamb ...???....!!!! course  black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan course  squab inspired by mir course  anjou pear onion, brie, smoking cinnamon course  ginger five other flavors course  blueberry buttermilk, sorrel, macadamia course  balloon helium, green apple course  white chocolate strawberry, english pea, lemon it is so hard to pick what course i liked best as each was delicious and each more beautiful than the next. standouts to me in taste were hot potato, cold potato, the lamb with a million sides, and the black truffle explosion. standouts to me in presentation were the lamb , blueberry dessert, green apple balloon and the white chocolate finale. best part of my night meeting grant archatz. oh em gee i almost died when i saw him coming out to tables for the dessert course. art at the table executed by the artist himself in person. the best chef in the country, in my humble opinion, pure culinary genius. i whispered to him...we are really big fans...and i am sure totally creeped him out...but it had to be said! alinea was the most amazing culinary experience i have ever had. i highly recommend putting it into your budget as i did and making a night of it."
1539,Sam C.,1130,3,11/13/12,"i know i am going to get alot of backlash for this but you know what. i am going to be true to myself. alinea is first and foremost one of the cutting edge restaurant in the us and i have been wanting to go for the longest time. they invent flavors i have not had and actually has woken me up in terms of flavor and texture. the following is what i had  macintosh apple cider  butternut muscovado, finger lime, west indies  oyster leaf mignonette  sea urchin with white chocolate, yuzu, wasabi top   lobster  trinity, sherry, chervil  top neck clam  shiso, soy, daikon  otoro  thai banan, sea salt, kaffir lime  corn  huitlacoche, sour cherry, silk  arctic char  sage, bourbon, upland crest  hot potato  cold potato, black truffle top   matsutake mushroom with pork belly, huckleberry, pine  black truffle explosion  romaine, parmesan top    styles lamb shoulder, belly, sirloin with  different condiments  woodcock tempura  lingonberry, shallot, oak leaves  giner  five other flavors  carrot  coconut, white sesame, caramelized honey  balloon  helium, green apple  dark chocolate  rye, birch syrup most of these dishes have really unique characteristic. it is fun but yet focused on flavor. it uses cutting edge technique the white chocolate, yuzu foam makes me crave more. black truffle explosion having the soup explode in your mouth. although it tastes good and it is a fun meal, it lacks a bit of substances. for me personally, i do crave some meat. or a pastarisotto dish, where the chef can highlight the use of those ingredients but using cool technique to do it the lamb was a bad execution in my personal opinion because there is no explanation of the different condiments, but the lamb is good. also, the lack of dessert ok..the dark chocolate is cool to look at but the flavor was not the best. so not the best way to end the night in terms of flavor. i think that is what is lacking for me. but i can see the bigger picture, the technique, the flavor, the texture. it makes sense but it does not. perhaps that is why they call this a show and not a meal. however, mcdonald is always down the street if you are starved, but the closest to a show there is the toy in the happy meal."
1540,Jeff M.,1130,5,10/15/12,"let me walk you through our meal. the first item lemonade happened before we were even seated. before entering the building, i told them my name. as they opened the front doors, they told us to grab a glass of lemonade to refresh. you will find a place to put your finished glasses when you are done. once inside, the doors closed and we were in a poorly lit hallway. to our left, was a level but moving water feature with stemless glasses filled with lemonade. no sight just aroma, taste, and sound of water and clinking. by the time we finished, we found an area to deposit our glasses. two doors opened star trek enterprise style, revealing a gentleman, waiting to take us to our tables. no tablecloths here. sturdy black wooden tables. alinea is unlike any other restaurant in america. and more so than any other restaurant in america, this will evoke memories and emotions like no other. some dishes will make you recall childhood memories. or specific times or locations. some dishes will make you regress and make you clap like a fiveyear old. some dishes will literally make your head scratch. others will make you talk in a highpitched voice. seriously. most of these dishes require specific instructions. on how to eat or how to operate the apparatus. this meal makes you think about how one eats. steelhead roe, peach, st. germain, kinome a dish whose vehicle involves glass straws and a block of ice. oyster leaf, mignonette king crab, passionfruit, heart of palm, allspice lobster, carrot, chamomile razor clam, shiso, soy, daikon served on a bed of seaweed. woolly pig, fennel, orange, squid served on something called an antenna and merely bob and consume in one bite. tomato, watermelon, chili, basil simple but incredible. corn, huitlacoche, sour cherry, silk corn as filaments and rocks. otoro, thai banana, sea salt, kaffir lime immerse your face in a domeshaped dish and smell thailand. chanterelle, ramps, asparagus, smoked date eat off of a bed of warm rocks that lie on a scorched and smoking wood. hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter a timesensitive dish that is a shock of temperatures, tastes, and textures. lamb ...?????....!!!!!!! three preparations of lamb and  garnishes choose our own adventure. black truffle, explosion, romaine, parmesan a spoonsized bite that seems to transform from solid to liquid to gas in an instant. anjou pear, onion brie, smoking cinnamon this cannot be described in words. ginger, five other flavors five metal rods with bites, to be eaten counterclockwise. blueberry, buttermilk sorrel a dessert with sorrel liquid, activated by dry ice. balloon, green apple, helium bite, eat, and talk. it is delicious. and it is real helium. white chocolate, strawberry, english pea, lemon chef achatz and his chef de cuisine appear at tableside and paint literally a delicious dessert. four hours of true creativity and genius. there is no restaurant in america doing what chef grant achatz does. no restaurant is more appropriately named than alinea."
1541,Scott E.,1130,5,9/22/12,"unlike next, which we would eaten at the previous night, where each dish is completely recognizable but notable for being the best possible incarnation of itself, alinea delivers a meal created by willy wonka, with all the rules thrown out the window. i will not recount every course, just highlight the dishes that made me laugh, or let me know this was a restaurant like no other, a place where there were no rules that had to be followed, a sanctuary which allowed a chef freedom to go wherever imagination led. for example, while the beverage choices were explained, six bowls containing blocks of ice resting on beds of pebbles were placed on the table, without a word being said about what they were for. each block had a hole drilled in the center, and once we would made our decisions about what we would be drinking, servers then came to the table with glass straws filled with steelhead roe in a liquid and stoppered at either end with foam. we were instructed to take our straws, fit them into the perfectly sized hole, now filled with ice melt, and inhale the mixture in a single slurp as quickly and as loudly as we could. the frigid rush of roe and herbs and peach i am unsure whether that fruit flavor came from the straw or the melt was sweet and salty and made us giggle, a perfect start to the most unusual meal of my life. for lamb , we were each presented with a narrow plate containing three perfect pieces of lamb , each prepared in a different manner, and two plexiglas shields were placed in the center of the table, each with  different garnishes, none of them identified, but all, we were promised, fitting accompaniments to the lamb . i cut the three tender servings into three smaller pieces so i could experience more of the flavor combinations, and the table turned into a guessing game as we each plucked the sides that tempted us and tried to identify what we would chosen. not every course was as unusual in its presentation as that. some courses astonished with their perfection alone. hot potato, cold potato, which we were told was one of the oldest courses that still remained on the alinea menu, consisted of a paraffin bowl filled with cold potato soup, while a hot potato and a piece of truffle were held aloft by a skewer which went through the lip of the bowl. we were to pull the pin, and the moment the two ingredients met, we were to toss it back, so the soup had no time to warm, the potato no time to chill, and the two flavors and temperatures only came together on the tongue. then there was the black truffle explosion, which was served on a spoon, and to be chewed with closed lips, so none of the delectable juice escaped. these awed not by the science fictional nature of their presentations, but from the precise combination of their ingredients, eaten at exactly the right moment. one course that makes clear why a dish must be eaten when served is the green apple helium balloon, which if not ingested upon delivery, would, i fear, end up collapsing upon itself before eaten. the skin of the balloon as well as the string with which we held it were both made of apply taffy, and we were told to press our lips against the balloon, take a bite, and inhale. my mouth filled immediately with the intense flavor of appleand with helium as well, of courseso we were all soon talking about how amazing it tasted while sounding like mickey and minnie mouse. for our final course, the table was cleared, and we were asked to lift our glasses as a silicone covering was rolled out. servers then brought many small bowls, two metal jugs sweating with condensation, and three white globes with circular holes in their tops. then two chefs arrived, and began spooning out the contents of the bowls onto the table, scattering them like culinary jackson pollacks as they identified eachfreezedried strawberry, english pea, buttermilk cream, and so on. then the chefs each lifted a jug and announced, liquid nitrogen, and poured the contents into the white globes, which caused a fog to rise and cover the table. finally, the chefs lifted the globes, which were made of white chocolate, and smashed them upon the table, revealing the goodies withinmeringues, cotton candy, miniature jelly donuts, condensed honeydew melon, and more. after which we took our spoons and attacked, not making as much of a dent as the creation deserved. at meal's end, we stepped out of the restaurant ... four hours and thirtynine minutes after we had arrived. yes. the meal took four hours and thirtynine minutes. but i assure you that it did not feel as if that much time had passed, because ... oh, i am going to go into cliche mode now, but you know how it is sometimes said that time stood still? well, time did not stand still, per se, but ... let us just say that while we were in alinea, it did not exist. we were outside of time, in a pocket universe all to ourselves."
1542,Justin L.,1130,5,9/8/12,"overall, was it worth the hype? yes and more. was it worth every penny? hell yes! is it a life changing food experience? yes! will i be coming back? you bet! soon? probably not, it definitely broke the bank and i would also like to see a different menu. truly star experience. i was able to snag a top ticket from their new ticketing system, which is not hard to obtain as long as you follow them on facebook or twitter and you check fairly regularly. the meal at the end of the day ran me nearly , which i will say without hesitation was the best  i have ever spent. everything from the food, wine pairing, service sort of, atmosphere, was everything you paid for and more. they only have a prixfixe menu of  items, mostly all of them were excellent. they all emphasized the pure flavors of the ingredients such as the corn as well as the tomato both fantastic and one our favorites. other courses emphasized the subtleties and complementary flavors such as the chanterelle probably our favorite of the evening. other items were shock and awe like the lamb with  different complementary ingredients, which was fun and interactive good but by far not the best dish and the apple balloon with edible string by far the most fun dish. other courses emphasized a whole new experience, like the black truffle explosion and the white chocolate dessert made tableside by the chef. even after plus weeks after eating there, there were a lot of items that i still remember every aspect, this was truly a lifechanging meal. other aspects of the restaurant like the decor itself was nice and dimly lit. the service overall was flawless, but some of the staff was not very friendly and a little stuckup. our main server however was fairly interactive and friendly. the kitchen tour was amazing as well, spotless and got a chance to do one of our courses prepared on the spot. though we did not get to meet chef achatz, his current chef there was friendly, articulate, and still producing magnificent food. i would certainly like to see him open his own restaurant in the future. if you made it this far in my review and probably others, just do yourself a favor and just grab a ticket and a date and eat here. you will not regret it. one additional note here after eating at charlie trotter's about a month before and paying nearly  per person with wine. trotter's did not come anywhere near to what alinea produced in terms of experience and food. although, the wine pairings there were superior."
1543,Keith S.,1130,3,10/31/18,"the overall experience was very good with impeccable service but the food was not as good as what i have expected given the  michelin stars. the best dish was the pork stew. the squab , scallop noodles and langoustine nori paper broth were also pretty good. i did not like the opening dish of trout roe with coconut and lychee. the sweet dishes were not as good as the savory ones. we were late with reservation so only able to book the salon menu. for first timer, if you were not able to book the gallery menu, i would wait and try another day. given the expectation, the salon menu may leave you disappointed."
1544,Law H.,1130,2,6/2/18,"i would have loved to give a higher rating but for a three star michelin restaurant i was less then impressed with the service, food, and wine pairing. having selected the top wine pairing selection the salon pairing at person and having a description of how it was going to be the top rated reserve wines from the alinea cellar i was very excited. having eaten at roister and drinks at aviary the nights before i was ready to be blown away. unfortunately i was blown away by the lack of presentation and minimal effort put into the actual pairing. if the average bottle used for the reserve selection is less then  bottle i am scared to know what they use for the normal wine pairing level. i mean dassai  is a great sake for drinking at home or with a sushi meal but to be served as a part of a reserve pairing with supposedly three star grade food is a joke. not only that at one part of the meal they forgot my squab when they removed the charcoal and left the table... with me wondering where my main dish was. i flagged down our waiter and made them aware that my dish was incomplete with that they abruptly scooped up my plate my wife's plate and said they would be doing a reset. but here's the kicker for me... no real explanation or apology was followed by this goof nor was anything added to our meal or experience for such a serious goof up... but honestly the biggest glaring eye sore will be the wine pairing which at its price point should have been spot on as i just had two separate dinners in nyc at jungsik which is only a two star michelin and has a similarly priced wine pairing at person, but they came out with krug, opus one, chteau d'yquem, and a few other real premium wines... the only thing i would say that keeps them from getting a one star this time around would be the personable nature of the staff... but for a three star restaurant that is not a saving grace to me..."
1545,Shawn H.,1130,5,5/1/18,"this was a nearlyfour hour fever dream of amazingness. i do not know if it was the best meal of my life, but it definitely is in the conversation on a short list that includes other top places, such as osteria francescana, eleven madison park, and momofuku ko. first off, the food is incredible  there is a lot of other stuff going on, but if there was no theater to it, it would still be world class food. i am not sure what my favorite was there are a lot of candidates, from the parsnip soup with lemon and caviar that we started with, to the black artichoke balls, to the squab that was hidden under coal, but just about every bite was incredible, and we all left extremely full. the theater is a huge part of it, though, as is the environment in general, which, to my surprise was not stuffy at all  the staff there was funny and really down to earth, if not quite casual. that, combined with what felt like basically perfect pacing, really added to the experience. as did the theatrics, which i will not give away here. in all, an amazing experience that was truly worth the incredibly high price tag."
1546,Alexis J.,1130,5,3/9/18,"two words pure magic. if you imagine a world similar to willy sonja's chocolate factory but with savory bites, alinea is just that. just when you feel like you know what is going to happen next, something unexpected happensand considering i have watched plenty of documentary or read all about it, it was a completely unique experience in that moment. if you are trying to justify the cost, let me be the first to tell you that you are not only paying for  courses, you are paying for  hours of entertainment much like you would a concert, play or museum, elevated dishes you would probably never find elsewhere, and pure love and passion put into the experience. we did a  pm reservation for  in the saloon highly recommend. you still get to see grant and the kitchen and pay a fraction of the cost though i would definitely like the opportunity to sit kitchenside if i had . they give you a crossword puzzle with no key, and your table has the opportunity to search for words between course that identify the names or element of dishes. and then given the menu at the end wall the answers i am a picky eater, and definitely do not like veggies and i finished all but one course on the menu  do not view below if you do not want to spoil the menu items for this seasonal time. ____________________ ____________________ plates we loved wet snow spear ranina ranina glow ink rock invisible balloon paint plates that were ok campfire glass the cape drinkcake in kitchen crunch paper smolder black plates that were not faves bean spiral squab"
1547,Joly W.,1130,4,7/3/15,"this review is for their december  menu and contains detailed spoilers, so i waited half a year to write this review until their menu changes enough. if you are looking forward to visiting alinea soon and love surprises, try refraining from reading too many reviews! it will ruin some of the wonder & joy. first off, from the outside it is very inconspicuous and it is easy to go right past alinea our uber driver zoomed right past it. the entrance is a long corridor that enhances your anticipation and curiosity. once your coat is taken and you are seated, you will not get a print out of your tasting menu until the very end. you will have to let go and listen as your server walks you through your night. one nice touch is they noted it was our  year anniversary and wrote happy anniversary at the top of our menu at the end! we did not pick the option of wine pairings, but from the conversations we heard around us the servers will explain indepth all of the pairing choices and some of them seemed enticing enough. not sure if it will be worth the extra ~ though. all in all, it took us about . to  hours to complete the  courses. your servers never rush you, except it might be wise to try to keep up with the tables around you since it will ruin the surprise if you keep overhearing every dish. the whole menu is timed well with portion sizes that are somehow figured out just right. you end up decently satisfied you are not stuffed but also not still hungry at the end. it is definitely an experience you will not forget, but also something i would not be able to justify doing again any time soon unless i won the lottery tomorrow. i did notice that some of the dishes were a bit too salty for my liking and overpowered some of the other flavors i would have liked to enjoy, hence the  stars. i think i overhyped it in my head and read too many reviews beforehand so it was not as magical as i would hope a  experience would be. of course, grant achatz is still a gastronomical genius and the experience was still special. i think i would have loved to have seen him cook or learned more about the specialunique cooking processes behind some of the dishes to appreciate what i was eating more. courses # osetra traditional russian caviar with an egg yolk pudding, a lemon&red onion&caper clear jelly, and a brioche bread foam served with an abalone spoon # salsify strip of salsify root dried and soaked in soy hidden in this nest of branches. pretty much tasted like extremely salty jerky once we found it # skate served on a plate designed to look like an appetizer napkin we were instructed to eat it holding the plate in our palm as if we were at a cocktail party. skate fish with brown butter, lemon, and herbs # pebble made to look like if you were to look at the bottom of a bubbling stream full of pebbles. assortment of beans pebbles, poached ebi shrimp, ogo seaweed branch, white mushroom caps and white bean cream # john dory cubes of john dory fish with thai influenced peanut cream sauce, white sauce and broccoli microgreen florets, topped with vietnamese coriander. heavy asian influence served in an almost sushilike fashion, all on top of a very long, aged and cured plank of wood from an old barrel. this was our favorite dish of the night fun to eat and i love sushi. # eggplant cocoa nibs and mustard seeds in hot fresh ginger, lemongrass taken from the centerpiece above our table based curry broth with eggplant decorated with cilantro, pickled jalapeo all sitting on top of banana # matsutake silver bowl slices of matsutake pine mushroom torched at our table side on top of soy tapioca pearls in abalone white cream # hamachi fire setting in the middle hamachi yellowtail chunk, green bean, and shishito green pepper speared on a pine branch for roasting over the mini fire to our preference # pork belly spoilers this dish is hidden inside the fire in the ashes the whole time as a seaweed wrapped pork belly that our server retrieved and removed the burnt edges. pork belly, blackened parsnip spear served on top of a hot charred oak tree trunk log with squid ink, black garlic, kombu seaweed and mystery orange sauce # hot potato cold potato tiny, timesensitive delicate dish of hot potato, truffle, butter that we had to unpin and drop into cold potato creme soup and drink back like a shot. served in a tiny wax saucer # squab  this was my first time having pigeon and it was surprisingly tasty. came with beet, orange sauce, and some smoky dark flavors # were dessert courses that finished with the infamous tropical fruit smash drawing on the table. all of them were delicious and so fun to eat especially the taffy apple helium balloon that you eat after sucking out the helium and talking like daffy duck."
1548,Merrill O.,1130,5,2/14/15,"my one concern before dining at alinea was that they were going to be stuffy and full of themselves, because...well...because they are alinea. but that could not have been further from the truth! the staff was all friendly and attentive including the stellar beau, jaime and craig, and the dining experience itself was fun and whimsical. yes, whimsical. at alinea. who would have guessed?! and it truly is a dining experience, from first entering the restaurant down a space mountaintype hallway, to searching for one of your courses in the branch camouflage dish...kind of a where is waldo of food. the food itself was almost flawless. i did think the sauce on the squab was a bit overpowering, and there was a bit too much going on in the eggplantbananacocoacurry dish, but with  courses and associated wine pairings, there is plenty to take your mind off those near misses. seriously, the chicken skin, the hot potato and the maitake abalone were probably three of the best things i have ever eaten in my life. the only thing i thought did not work at all was the tropical fruit dessert. it is a cool concept...it is actually plated on the table not at the table....but on the table by the chef. unfortunately, chef grant achatz is not the most personable guy and that is okay...chefs do not have to be talkative and friendly, so the result is he very mechanically makes what should be a fanciful dessert, and then turns and walks away. to me, it just left a bitter taste at the end of a near perfect dinner. but, he is a master in the kitchen...no one will argue that! i highly recommend everyone experiencing dinner at alinea at least once...it is definitely worth the splurge."
1549,Jesstine G.,1130,5,12/23/14,"being a food freak, i jumped at the chance to dine at alinea. michelin star rating and # on the san pellegrino world's  best restaurants ...um, definitely! you pay for the meal when making reservations ~ pperson. the restaurant is located in the charming, upscale neighborhood of lincoln park. if you are staying downtown on michigan ave, it is just a  uber ride. from the valet to the final farewell, everyone is extremely gracious and friendly. after being greeted, they encouraged us to take a peek and pictures of the open kitchen. in fact, i was pleasantly surprised by the open photo policy. never once did they make us feel silly for taking pictures. only rule  no flash. we were then led upstairs to the dimly lit, sophisticated and modernly styled dining area. there is ample space between tables so your dining experience is truly your own. drinks are orderedpaid at the restaurant and include  gratuity. wine pairing is available for  if i recall correctly, which measures about   glasses of wine. i did not want to stumble out of there so i opted for wines by the glass. while there is a price list for bottles, there is no list for wines by the glass. they want to ensure your wine compliments the courses which only they know so they prefer to discuss wine selections with you. the sommelier was amazingly personable and made excellent recommendations. nonetheless, it is scary ordering wine without knowing the cost. we ordered a few glasses of champagne and wine. after seeing the bill, we paid an average of  per glass excluding tax and tip. not too bad. the dishes are perfectly timed. service is the best i have ever experienced. it was warm, friendly, attentive and extremely professional. absolutely amazing. there were sixteen courses. many were incredibly delicious and a couple were not palatable for my tastes, however each course was unbelievably creative and artistic. molecular gastronomy at its best. while i did not love each dish, i marveled at the innovative transformation of ingredients and the unique combination of textures and flavors. truthfully, i was disappointed in the protein selections. aside from a squab dish and a pork belly dish, there were no other meats. i would have loved some steak and game. but i am a carnivorous gal. also, i would have preferred one more main course in place of a dessert. i left dinner a little hungry. regardless, alinea truly provided a dining experience of a lifetime. i am so glad i went. i have uploaded a picture of the menu. courses do not change much over time. to see drastic changes, you should wait a minimum of  months."
1550,Sarah S.,1130,5,12/29/12,"review # has been reserved for the best meal of my life, hands down worth the cost, it excels in every possible way. alinea is sleek and chic without making you feel out of your element or uncomfortable with the modern class of the restaurant. from start to finish, the service and food astonished me. every course was an exploration for my tastebuds of new combinations and interesting twists on food i had never experienced before. as a broke foodie, this was the best example of food as art i have ever seen. i know, i know, i am gushing like a school girl over the cute boy in science class but alinea is pretty damn hot. rundown of our night together course  steelhead roe coconut, curry, carrot course  oyster leaf mignonette course  king crab passionfruit, heart of palm, allspice course  mussel saffron, chorizo, oregano course  razor clam shiso, soy, daikon course  woolly pig fennel, orange, squid course  scallop acting like agedashi tofu course  hamachi thai banana, sea salt, kaffir lime course  burn morels ramps, fiddlehead fern, miner's lettuce course  hot potato cold potato, black truffle, butter course  lamb   ...???....!!!! course  black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan course  squab inspired by mir course  anjou pear onion, brie, smoking cinnamon course  ginger five other flavors course  blueberry buttermilk, sorrel, macadamia course  balloon helium, green apple course  white chocolate strawberry, english pea, lemon it is so hard to pick what course i liked best as each was delicious and each more beautiful than the next. standouts to me in taste were hot potato, cold potato, the lamb with a million sides, and the black truffle explosion. standouts to me in presentation were the lamb, blueberry dessert, green apple balloon and the white chocolate finale. best part of my night meeting grant archatz. oh em gee i almost died when i saw him coming out to tables for the dessert course. art at the table executed by the artist himself in person. the best chef in the country, in my humble opinion, pure culinary genius. i whispered to him...we are really big fans...and i am sure totally creeped him out...but it had to be said! alinea was the most amazing culinary experience i have ever had. i highly recommend putting it into your budget as i did and making a night of it."
1551,Christy H.,1130,5,2/26/12,"i ate at alinea again last night, nearly two years after my first visit with a fleeting concern that my second visit would not live up to my first. all but one of the dishes was new  hot potato, cold potato remained on the menu. they must have listened to my prior review as they picked the right one as their trusty standby  all in all, this experience was even better than my first! . we started the meal with char roe accompanied by carrot, coconut and curry. this dish is not too memorable.  my friend has a salmon allergy, and they substituted mango for roe and impressively even printed up her menu with this substitution.   . oyster leaf, king crab, mussel and razor clam. brought out on a piece of driftwood from the ocean, this was one of the more unique presentations. the concept of the oyster leaf was unique  the oyster flavor was subtle and more present in the after taste. the razor clam was prepared in an asian sauce of shiso, soy and kaikon and was the winner of these four preparations. note that it was not clear to us until they brought out our printed menus that this was treated as  dishes as it seemed we completed our meal a few short of the  promised. . wooly pig served with fennel, orange, and squid.  served on a metal stick and meant to be eaten nohand's, this again was a unique and fun presentation. the fennel flavor, fortunately, was subtle and worked with the pig and squid. . scallop. served as a mouse rather than an actual scallop, the scallop flavor could have been stronger. this was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. . ice beet. the centerpiece on each table is a brick of ice with test tubes filled with a deep purple liquid. during this course, you slurp out the beet juice. if you like beets, this is awesome. . black sea bass. this was the most traditional dish served all evening and one of the highlights! this is a healthy portion  a whole fish split between two people. reviews had said to be careful to not eat too much of this to save room for the rest of the meal. at the end, we wished we had cleaned the bones on this bass. . hot potato  as good as i remembered it! the parmesan and truffle really make this dish. . wild mushrooms  i loved this dish but also love mushrooms. . venison  this was another of my favorites. you basically make a cabbage wrap with mustard, bacon, venison, and a few other accompaniments, and the flavors explode in your mouth. . black truffle  another masterpiece and debatably as good as hot potato. i am partial to truffles. . squab  the waiter arranges a bunch of forks and spoons on the table in front of you, one of which has the squab and the rest have different bites to go with it. you eat them one by one, dropping the forks and spoons into a bucket. this dish was more about presentation than substance though was not bad. . anjou pear served with brie. i was excited for this dish as love warm brie. i feel like the brie could have been stronger as i only tasted the pear. . ginger. five small pieces of ginger with varying intensity levels. a nice pallet cleanser. . winter. this was delicious! see the picture for presentation but basically the white snow was minty and melted in your mouth. so light and refreshing! . balloon. a green apple, helium infused balloon. fun to talk with helium, especially after all the wine pairings! . dark chocolate. much written about, one of the chefs grant was not in the house brought out a hollow chocolate ball filled with crackers ?, cotton candy, and more chocolate and smashed it on a table drizzled with three sauces butternut squash, lingonberry and stout. i would have much, much preferred that the sauces be salted caramel and peanut butter as i am a freak and do not like chocolate and fruit together. great concept and a fun end to our . hour experience! my friend and i both had the wine pairings though i asked for short pours as alinea has the reputation for pouring heavy, and i wanted to remember all of the meal! neither of us felt like we had that much wine by the end of the evening, and i would not be scared to get full pours next time! there were a healthy number of sweeter wines. i am usually not a fan of sweet wine or port but these seemed to work well with the food. in terms of service, what i especially appreciate about alinea is the lack of pretentiousness of the waitstaff. they are engaging and unobtrusive. my only complaint was when the bill came, we had been charged  for a coffee and espresso. seems a bit steep, no? what separates alinea from other restaurants of this caliber is the uniqueness in the food and preparation. pure genious..."

1553,Me m.,1130,3,12/12/11,"the occasion our year anniversary. the destination the one, the only, the legendary alinea. the company our friends, firstrate foodies who were looking for the right excuse. we were shown to a nice table surrounded by four comfortable chairs. as soon as we sat, a cartoonlike timeshift occurred we slowed down while the staff around us went into a frenzy. they simply had no time. while i was in midsentence, they stepped in, placed a dish, explained the dish, and disappeared. all within a blink of an eye. we were left dumbfounded. where did these dishes come from? what were the secret ingredients? how were they used? so many questions unanswered. the process repeated again and again. dishes presented in haste. explanations mumbled. wine, seemingly unrelated to the food, was poured with little to no explanation. we never found out what two of the ten wines were. we tried. we really tried. we tried asking about the food. we tried asking about the wine. for our efforts we were rewarded with an additional five seconds of incoherent mumbling. my request to tell us more about the unusual caponata on my plate was answered the eggplant is not pureed. much of the magic was gone. the conversation centered on all but the food. ah, the food. yes, i almost forgot the food. twentycourses ranging from the absolutely divine to the downright mediocre were placed in front of us, in a rapid hour succession. from the heights of the razorclam to the lows of the single oyster leaf. from a whitetruffled risotto a notch above perfection, to a truffled pasta a notch below. from the sea urchin the likes of which i have never had to the cold borscht that plagued the meals of my childhood. inconsistent would be the perfect word to describe our dining experience. presentation won at the expense of taste. dishes such as the squab were left for us to interpret and construct without the guiding wisdom of our host chef. the last desert, the dark chocolate, for all its pomposity was a meaningless collection of random tastes. we all agreed it simply did not work. the king is naked. imagine a scale where price and hedonism battle for gravity's reach. we came looking for the ultimate decadent dining experience. we knew that the sum paid would be beyond the realms of logic and justification  alinea complied. but the scales would not balance. the hedonistic animal within us left unsatiated and ashamed. the food did not reach the glorious promised peaks the service did not break the surface of polite friendliness curiosity was not satisfied. we will have to keep looking."
1554,Michael U.,1130,5,11/20/11,"my third visit and as good as ever. highlight courses below but see the blog for full review  for the next course we received not only a bowl but also a story and when it was all said and done brook trout reflections of steve stallard would prove to be the second best dish i have ever had at alinea. named as an ode to chef achatz's friend who normally provides his whole harvest of brook trout roe to alinea this dish opted to pair the roe with the entirety of the fish  head, spine, tail, fillets, and fins  in a glass bowl along with michigan maple syrup, pecans, wild puffed rice, nasturtium flowers, and white beans both whole and pureed. again complicated in a way that very few can achieve with such finesse this was the sort of dish where each bite presented an entirely different experience  some intense and briny while others were creamy and sweet with the best for myself being half of the maple syrup bubble paired with a dollop of roe, a bit of the bean puree, and the crispy fish head in a single spoonful.  for the pillow course a dish entitled wild mushrooms, pine, sumac, ramp would arrive featuring matisutake, maitake, chanterelle, and hon shimeji mushrooms in varying degrees of preparation mixed with pine cream, sumac breadcrumbs, pickled ramps, fried shallots, thyme, wild lettuce, and mushroom reduction. slightly awkward as it always is eating off of a pillow the dish was presented with jokes about one of the servers frequently dumping this plate on guests just joking, just joking but once the pillow deflated a bit filling the air with the light essence of vaporized pine this course would prove to be my second favorite of the evening, a flawless woodsy amalgam that trumped even the much raved walk in the forest at next the following day.  for the next savory course chef achatz would find inspiration in a london housed painting by miro for a tabletop arrangement appropriately titled  squab inspired by miro. beginning first by spraying and polishing the table with black tea this course was presented with nine forks and spoons arranged 'as random as possible' and containing  squab , foie gras...and the rest is for you to figure out as two large vessels spewed forth a light lavender aroma that washed over the table and permeated the air. with no specific instructions on how to eat this save for placing the used utensils in the silver vessels the next six minutes would prove an adventurous blind tasting of squab , foie gras, celery root with pumpernickel, picholine olive, lavender noodle, duck fat with blis vinegar, yellow plum, and fig  all but the noodle and duck fat being guessed spot on by our trio and all in all a great bit of fun.  for the final presentation of the evening the silpat would arrive first followed shortly thereafter by two large chocolate colored vessels, a quartet of small bowls, a steaming pot of liquid nitrogen, and finally by chef achatz with apron surprisingly stained and face appearing slightly sullen and stern without speaking a word a trend we noted with each of the other tabletop presentations in the room as well. beginning first by placing the two vessels at the center of the table and filling each with an ample amount of liquid nitrogen chef achatz next proceeded to drizzle the table with reductions of lingonberry syrup, citrus and butternut squash reduction, and goose island caramel stout before dusting the entirety of the table with edible citrus marigold flowers and subsequently lifting each of the vessels and dropping them to the table where they shattered releasing contents that can best be described as the result of breaking open a child's halloween basket or perhaps a piata. with chocolate notes predominating some bites while flavors of the squash, berries, and stout punctuated others this enormous dessert went slowly  easily over the course of twenty to thirty minutes as we playfully explored its contents everything from cotton candy and fruit rollups to cookies and candies such as house made twizzlers and corn nuts. with bites of brioche, balls of butterscotch, and crumbles tasting both like gingerbread and kettle corn rounding out the experience all i can say is that was a dessert as well suited for a child's dream as it was for fine dining and as we finished the final spoonfuls our server stopped by with a look of surprise stating wow, i do not think i have ever seen anyone clean the table quite so well. "
1555,Alan S.,1130,5,8/20/11,"i had dinner at alinea about two months ago. as a young chef, i have been a fan of chef achatz for a while and was very excited to finally get to try his food. the evening was perfect. the food, the atmosphere, the staff, etc... truly one of the best meals i have ever had. the flavors that lingered on my palate balanced the following dish perfectly. there was a squab course i was not the biggest fan of but if i only had one complaint out of  courses, i am okay with that. the price was high as is expected of any  micheline star restaurant but i would gladly do it again and look forward to the next visit!"
1556,Kari P.,1130,5,1/16/11,". stars. a meal at alinea is an experience. it is not just the food, which is fantastic, but the presentation that makes it so great. very few of the  courses we had even came on plates, but rather logs, pillows, test tubes, wires, and more. out of  courses some, only a few were not to my liking. the squab was not my favorite, but my husband really enjoyed it. so many dishes were fun, creative, and painstakingly created. the effort shows and is worth it. i do not know that i would have the same experience if i went back, because part of it is the uniqueness of the situation. i would recommend it to anyone that likes to savor and enjoy their food, including creativity and depth of flavor."
1557,Tayson H.,1130,5,11/13/10,"just a headsupyou will not get a meal at alineayou get an experience. that is really the best way to describe it. starting from the minute you enter the unmarked double doors, followed by walking down the long hallway lit my warm red lights reminiscent of a fashion runway to the hidden door that magically opens as you walk by it a la get smart. and that is just the entrance! you will be greeted by a warm, knowledgeable, and friendly staff ready to attend to your every dining whim and answer any of your curiosities. now, for the food!  courses of delightbest   hours of dining i have ever had. first up, a trio of edible shotslemon, apple, and squash flavors. then golden trout roe on top of coconut mousse and pineapple foam with a licorice sauce. next up, a shrimp stick eaten with your hands and dipped in miso mayo. right next to it was a take on vietnamese chao tomcompressed sugar cane flavor  shrimp and mint. monochromatic white dishhalibut with black pepper bleached white, vanilla, and lemon. apple with horseradish and celery juice...in a shot glass...culminating in a liquid explosion in your mouth! now we get to some really interesting stuffa rabbit trio parfait, rillettes, consomm served in an egg shaped babushka. that means the parfait was on the top layer, the rillettes with blood sausage on the middle layer, and the consomm as the bottom layer. amazing. next, i smelled smoke. what is burning?? ah, the staff bring out burning oak leaves! and somewhere in that mix sits a scrumptious pheasant dumpling with green grape and walnut nestled inside. now it is time to use our hands to play with food ravioli skin  short ribs  olives  blackberry  smoked sea salt = the bomb! next is a shot of cold potato, black truffle, and butter. following that is a pigeonneauthat is squab prepared foie gras style and resting on top of a puff pastrydelish! but my favorite dish of the night had to be the black truffle explosion with hint of romaine and parmesan. let me tell you, after eating this, everyone at my table took a moment of silence to savor what they just experienced. it was that good. no joke. now that we have worked our way through the savory dishes, it is time to warmup to dessert by consuming a pineapple and ham infused crisp tastes like the best hawaiian pizza you would have, butterscotch and apple flavored smoked bacon, and a caramel popcorn shot. out. of. this. world. if that was not enough, now on to the real dessert earl grey shortbread mixed with lemon curd, pine nuts, and caramelized white chocolate. bubble gum straw with tapioca balls that you suck right out of the straw! to finish, a fantastic chocolate dish with blueberry, honey, and peanut that just sets the mood right for the end of the night. and to boot, the staff took us on a tour of the story, dining room, space and, of course, i could not resist picking up chef grant achatz's cookbook. if you could not tell by now, this dining experience blew my mindthe best i have had so far! i cannot recommend aliena enough if you happen to be in chicago. or you could do what i did and book your flight to chicago around a successful reservation to alinea. trust me, it is worth every dollar and you will spend a lot of dollars here. alinea does not disappoint. i wish i could eat here every night."

1559,Verlee G.,1130,5,3/3/13,"traveling to chicago last october, it was a must that i had to make ressies at alinea. it was the first time they rolled out doing the ticketing system online, and boy  did that process have me stressed out. i had no idea when tickets were going live since it was the first time releasing tickets for augustseptoctober. luckily, i was able to snag one of their last seatings at pm because when it rolled out live, i was an hour late in the shower of course after constantly checking online. enough of the ticketing system, the experience and staff were awesome and not at all pretentious. pretty laid back, actually.  as soon as you first walk through the stealth door, to the end where they are handing you the menu, it was an impeccable time. everything was prepared beautifully. some dishes stood out more than others of course. sometimes i had to just laugh out loud what they were putting in front of me  almost comical like the wooden plank with algae for the sea urchinlobster razor clam dish. my favorites were the otoro, brook trout, the black truffle, and the lamb served three ways. i felt like a mad scientist trying out the  different sides to play with. and when would you ever eat a green apple helium balloon? so much fun. lots of people ask me if it was worth the money and if they should go. yes, definitely. it is not just for the food, it is for the fun, the amazement, the experience."
1560,Jake W.,1130,5,1/12/13,"i cannot imagine that any review you read here is going to sway one to come here or not. if you want to go, it is very expensive and you have to pay in adavance. it is all extremely interesting, awesome presentation and very delicious. the menu changes, but i can give the list of what i got. hot chocolate while we waited. was actually really good. we got blocks of ice that were hollowed out with spices at the bottom. they poured hot tea in and we drank it out with big straws. excellent presentation, decent tea. the next was a group of sea food. a leaf that tasted like a clam weird that it tasted like clam , but good, razor clam  good, lobster claw  excellent and sea urchin with white chocolate and wasabi that was awesome. the next dish was in a fishbowl that was otoro with thai banana, sea salt and lime. really cool presentation again and pretty tasty. then we got a spread of corn. the presentation was based on the artwork in the dining room. it was sweet, crunchy, soft and salty all at once. one of my favorites. after that we got an arctic char, which came out on a two by four with lit charcoal underneath keeping it warm. the skin was still on and crispy. delicious. the next was a potato ball with truffle on top. it came on a skewer and was good, but did not blow me away. after that was was a matsutake mushroom with pork, huckleberry and pine. it came on stones that were under a group of pine needles. excellent and i am not even a huge mushroom fan. next was a black truffle ravioli. awesome. so delicious. i could have eaten ten. the next dish was my favorite. it was three pieces of lamb. all three were prepared differently and they would not tell us what they were specifically. then, they gave the table a tray with about  toppings, each one different. we chose one for each piece of lamb  could have been a sauce, an herb, fruit, etc. so cool. everyone had something different. could not use all the toppings, but wish i could have. the next was a woodcock dumpling. it came on a stem with a burning leaf on the end. the smell of the burning leaf was nice and the dumpling was awesome. the woodcock was tender and juicy and the skin was thin and crispy. the last dish before dessert was ginger. we got five metal skewers, each with a piece of ginger prepared in a different way. i am not a big ginger fan, but they were all very interesting. my friend loved ginger and she loved it. the first dessert was the most fun dish of the night. it was a green apple flavored helium balloon. green apple is my favorite candy flavor and this was nice and sticky and chewy. it was fun to hear everyone talk in the helium voice as we ate. the last dessert had the best presentation. two chefs came out and painted a design on the table of sauces and bits of chocolate. the design, like the corn, was reminiscent of the art on the wall. in the middle of the table the whole time were two frozen chocolate coconut sized balls. after designing the table, they smashed the chocolate balls which were full of ice cream and some other goodies. awesome presentation and delicious. overall, good food and great experience. glad i came. something i will never forget."
1561,Joanne W.,1130,5,1/3/13,"alinea has been on my list for quite some time and i am happy to report that i am finally able to cross this place off my list! is alinea the best meal i have ever had? quite possibly. is it the best dining experience, i have ever had? absolutely. alinea lives up to the hype in my opinion and is something not to be missed if you can swing it. for me it was a once in a lifetime experience and i will always remember it. stand outs for me were black truffle explosion, hot potatocold potato, smoked morels morels that were planted and harvested after a burn giving these fungi a nice smokey flavor. seriously!, assorted seafood crab, lobster, razor clam , oyster leaf which were served on this cool vessel made of seaweed, the taffy balloon and the white chocolate bomb desserts. i also enjoyed the lamb dish served with  different components for you to experiment with. the presentation is spectacular. so inventive, each course is a work of art. it is truly an experience for the senses. surprisingly, alinea is not pretentious. our servers were great, laid back and throwing back the jokes with us. there is not a lot i can say that has not already been said so i will end my review with a quote by virginia woolf. one cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. and i did."
1562,Josh Q.,1130,5,11/6/12,"amazing. the black truffle explosion and hotcold potato were easily the highlight of my night, weekend, and month. the weird thing is i developed an allergic reaction from the razor clam , but it is just as well, since if i had died that night i would have died happily. the meal is expensive, but i do not blame them since the costs here must be enormous from the efforts they put in to make every course perfect from its preparation and presentation to its taste. while i am someone who values food quality much more than its presentation, i was still astounded to the presentation here and give achatz props for bringing an art form to our taste buds."
1563,Jeff M.,1130,5,10/15/12,"let me walk you through our meal. the first item lemonade happened before we were even seated. before entering the building, i told them my name. as they opened the front doors, they told us to grab a glass of lemonade to refresh. you will find a place to put your finished glasses when you are done. once inside, the doors closed and we were in a poorly lit hallway. to our left, was a level but moving water feature with stemless glasses filled with lemonade. no sight just aroma, taste, and sound of water and clinking. by the time we finished, we found an area to deposit our glasses. two doors opened star trek enterprise style, revealing a gentleman, waiting to take us to our tables. no tablecloths here. sturdy black wooden tables. alinea is unlike any other restaurant in america. and more so than any other restaurant in america, this will evoke memories and emotions like no other. some dishes will make you recall childhood memories. or specific times or locations. some dishes will make you regress and make you clap like a fiveyear old. some dishes will literally make your head scratch. others will make you talk in a highpitched voice. seriously. most of these dishes require specific instructions. on how to eat or how to operate the apparatus. this meal makes you think about how one eats. steelhead roe, peach, st. germain, kinome a dish whose vehicle involves glass straws and a block of ice. oyster leaf, mignonette king crab, passionfruit, heart of palm, allspice lobster, carrot, chamomile razor clam , shiso, soy, daikon served on a bed of seaweed. woolly pig, fennel, orange, squid served on something called an antenna and merely bob and consume in one bite. tomato, watermelon, chili, basil simple but incredible. corn, huitlacoche, sour cherry, silk corn as filaments and rocks. otoro, thai banana, sea salt, kaffir lime immerse your face in a domeshaped dish and smell thailand. chanterelle, ramps, asparagus, smoked date eat off of a bed of warm rocks that lie on a scorched and smoking wood. hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter a timesensitive dish that is a shock of temperatures, tastes, and textures. lamb ...?????....!!!!!!! three preparations of lamb and  garnishes choose our own adventure. black truffle, explosion, romaine, parmesan a spoonsized bite that seems to transform from solid to liquid to gas in an instant. anjou pear, onion brie, smoking cinnamon this cannot be described in words. ginger, five other flavors five metal rods with bites, to be eaten counterclockwise. blueberry, buttermilk sorrel a dessert with sorrel liquid, activated by dry ice. balloon, green apple, helium bite, eat, and talk. it is delicious. and it is real helium. white chocolate, strawberry, english pea, lemon chef achatz and his chef de cuisine appear at tableside and paint literally a delicious dessert. four hours of true creativity and genius. there is no restaurant in america doing what chef grant achatz does. no restaurant is more appropriately named than alinea."
1564,Sue P.,1130,5,8/28/12,"what can be said that has not already been said? dinner this past sunday was the most fun i've had in a while. from the moment we stepped out of the cab to the moment we got back in one after the  course meal, alinea carved out a complete sensory experienceevery one of my sense were tickled and prodded to attention. you go for the experience, for the fun, to be amazed. there is no music playing in the background to drown out noise from the kitchen or conversations at nearby tables. there are no candles, tablecloth, or mini flower centerpieces on the table. it is just you, your dining companion, the staff, and the food. and that is all you need for the  hours. the food itself was not always perfect. certain dishes were overly salty trio if lamb, razor clam , some did not make sense corn silk dish, sea salt foam on the otoro dish, but when it was good, it was some of the best and most creative food i've ever had steelhead roe straw w peach, hot cold potato, black truffle dumpling explosion, watermelon snow w chili and tomato. again, have fun and be amazed. what is the point otherwise?"
1565,Steven N.,1130,3,8/24/12,"there are already tons of professional & amateur reviews of alinea, you can read through them if you want to get into the details. i will spend my time here throwing out some general impressions, in no particular order. enjoy!  book buy tickets way, way, way in advance. this place is booked for at least two months out.  mental prep  do not overhype this place before your first visit. like most other fine dining restaurants, this place is very, very good. however, if you keep thinking this is supposed to be the # rated restaurant in the you.s., you are likely to leave disappointed like my wife and i.  dinner for the  of us took over  hours to complete. make sure you go with fun, good company. even for couples...it is hard to have a hour dinner together...we saw many bored couples that did not talk.  dress nice. real nice. 'nuff said.  do not go cheap here. if you are already spending this much on dinner, might as well get the wine pairing if you like to drink different kinds of wine. or, if you are like us and do not drink that much, just get a bottle. expect to spend about   , for two people.  the food profiles are innovative and presentation was visually stunning. it takes a true genise to come up with each course. however, my wife and i were only knock our socks off wowed by just a few courses. we particularly liked the razor clams , crab, and mushrooms served on heated stones.  service  it is nice, but less formal  attentive than what i would expect at a place like this. not that we enjoy a place that is super formal and stuffy, but it felt a bit too casual for us.  we also would have appreciated a bit more explanation of what we are eating before each course. our waiter just did not know or wanted to spend the time to explain. in fact, it was a bit annoying that he wants us to guess what we were eating. really annoying, now that i think about it again. we paid good money to eat there, show an effort to explain things.  just to be clear, none of the courses tasted bad. we were just looking to be wowed by each course...and it did not happen.  dessert  while seeing them prepare it in front of us was cool, it really was not that complex and the taste was a bit disappointing.  valet  it is only , do it. it is a nice touch that they already have the car pulled up front waiting for you by the time you walk out the door."
1566,Joshua D.,1130,5,4/18/12,"my wife and i ate here on , and i have to say, this was far and away the dining experience of my life. if i could give it  stars, i would! everyone will tell you about the food. the creativity of the presentations i ate a balloon!, the intense flavors in each course i could have had about a dozen of the razor clams , or black truffle explosions, or a gallon of hot potatocold potato, or the lamb course, or the the dessert finale presented at our table by chef de cuisine matt chasseur, the food is truly spectacular. what i would like to highlight is the service. going in, you know it is a truly worldclass restaurant, from the  michelin stars, critical acclaim, internet reviews across the internet, and so forth. what you will not know about is what it is like to actually be there. once you are there, you find that the service is exceptionally down to earth, and at the same time, disarmingly precise. i loved that they were not afraid to laugh with you custom hot pot pickeruppers, and at the same time serve your dishes as if it were a russian ballet. of course it all does come with a price, but once you go, you are left wondering how the heck am i going to get back here? i am still trying to figure it out!"
1567,Jennifer R.,1130,5,3/6/12,"mmmmm.... my favorite course winter in new hampshire i want to still be eating that snow balloon the greatest piece of candy anyone has ever given me seafood bites the mussel, razor clam , and crab were the best bites of those items i have ever had my complaint i wish i took my time more. they did not rush me of course. i just wish i slowed down a bit. haha... there are so many amazing things happening. the only solution is to do it again soon... big surprises an amazing person to walk us through the wine pairings. truly talented. there is nothing else to say that has not been said. i read every blog i could get my hands on before going. i know how well documented this meal is. still... i was in awe the entire time. talented team. thank you. hope to see you again soon, in a different season."
1568,Ashley M.,1130,5,2/26/12,"most amazing meal i have ever had. my boyfriend surprised with me dinner at alinea for my birthday this year and it could not have been a better evening. the atmosphere for our pm reservation on a wednesday night was perfect the servers were attentive, the dining room was not too loud so we could enjoy our conversation it was the perfect setting. our first plate was char roe with carrot, coconut and curry. we about fell out of our seats it was so simple yet amazingly delicious. other noteworthy plates include ice with beet, hibiscus and licorice the black truffle explosion winter in new hampshire hot potatocold potato razor clam with shiso, soy and dalkon lemongrass with papaya, thai basil and finger lime by the time we got to the awesome dessert presentation we were feeling quite full, but we could not pass up the last course. it was so much fun, like being a kid again, eating off the table but in a more sophisticated style! everything went perfect. for sure the best birthday meal ever."
1569,Christy H.,1130,5,2/26/12,"i ate at alinea again last night, nearly two years after my first visit with a fleeting concern that my second visit would not live up to my first. all but one of the dishes was new  hot potato, cold potato remained on the menu. they must have listened to my prior review as they picked the right one as their trusty standby  all in all, this experience was even better than my first! . we started the meal with char roe accompanied by carrot, coconut and curry. this dish is not too memorable.  my friend has a salmon allergy, and they substituted mango for roe and impressively even printed up her menu with this substitution.   . oyster leaf, king crab, mussel and razor clam . brought out on a piece of driftwood from the ocean, this was one of the more unique presentations. the concept of the oyster leaf was unique  the oyster flavor was subtle and more present in the after taste. the razor clam was prepared in an asian sauce of shiso, soy and kaikon and was the winner of these four preparations. note that it was not clear to us until they brought out our printed menus that this was treated as  dishes as it seemed we completed our meal a few short of the  promised. . wooly pig served with fennel, orange, and squid.  served on a metal stick and meant to be eaten nohand's, this again was a unique and fun presentation. the fennel flavor, fortunately, was subtle and worked with the pig and squid. . scallop. served as a mouse rather than an actual scallop, the scallop flavor could have been stronger. this was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. . ice beet. the centerpiece on each table is a brick of ice with test tubes filled with a deep purple liquid. during this course, you slurp out the beet juice. if you like beets, this is awesome. . black sea bass. this was the most traditional dish served all evening and one of the highlights! this is a healthy portion  a whole fish split between two people. reviews had said to be careful to not eat too much of this to save room for the rest of the meal. at the end, we wished we had cleaned the bones on this bass. . hot potato  as good as i remembered it! the parmesan and truffle really make this dish. . wild mushrooms  i loved this dish but also love mushrooms. . venison  this was another of my favorites. you basically make a cabbage wrap with mustard, bacon, venison, and a few other accompaniments, and the flavors explode in your mouth. . black truffle  another masterpiece and debatably as good as hot potato. i am partial to truffles. . squab  the waiter arranges a bunch of forks and spoons on the table in front of you, one of which has the squab and the rest have different bites to go with it. you eat them one by one, dropping the forks and spoons into a bucket. this dish was more about presentation than substance though was not bad. . anjou pear served with brie. i was excited for this dish as love warm brie. i feel like the brie could have been stronger as i only tasted the pear. . ginger. five small pieces of ginger with varying intensity levels. a nice pallet cleanser. . winter. this was delicious! see the picture for presentation but basically the white snow was minty and melted in your mouth. so light and refreshing! . balloon. a green apple, helium infused balloon. fun to talk with helium, especially after all the wine pairings! . dark chocolate. much written about, one of the chefs grant was not in the house brought out a hollow chocolate ball filled with crackers ?, cotton candy, and more chocolate and smashed it on a table drizzled with three sauces butternut squash, lingonberry and stout. i would have much, much preferred that the sauces be salted caramel and peanut butter as i am a freak and do not like chocolate and fruit together. great concept and a fun end to our . hour experience! my friend and i both had the wine pairings though i asked for short pours as alinea has the reputation for pouring heavy, and i wanted to remember all of the meal! neither of us felt like we had that much wine by the end of the evening, and i would not be scared to get full pours next time! there were a healthy number of sweeter wines. i am usually not a fan of sweet wine or port but these seemed to work well with the food. in terms of service, what i especially appreciate about alinea is the lack of pretentiousness of the waitstaff. they are engaging and unobtrusive. my only complaint was when the bill came, we had been charged  for a coffee and espresso. seems a bit steep, no? what separates alinea from other restaurants of this caliber is the uniqueness in the food and preparation. pure genious..."
1570,Steph C.,1130,5,1/23/12,"on january , , i dined at alinea. it was one of the best meals i will ever live to enjoy, and i am okay with that. for the first time, i find it impossible to fit both a thoughtful review and a complete log of my meal into  characters. i do not expect anyone to read all of this, but if you are interested, the full tour will be written below, with the remainder to follow. michael k. snagged us a table for , weeks before we booked our flights for the bone chill of january in chicago. my flight cost . my meal at alinea . i will tell you which one i liked more in a second. with janice k. and her sister frances, we made a party of four. we arrived a few minutes early and took advantage of the kitchen view while we waited. grant achatz kept himself busy in the most spotless, populated kitchen i have ever seen. when the time came, we were led to the downstairs dining room. the atmosphere was cool and calm, and the space was modern and sparsely decorated, interesting but not distracting. our table got some flair from a captivating block of clear ice with magenta vialshaped pockets. we were told this was not edible. service was worthy of all  michelin stars. our head waiter alex took care of us beautifully, with help from sommelier ben, and waiters johnny and jeremiah. they were personable, even jokey, while never straying from perfect competence and professionalism. they presented every course in detail, and swept the table for crumbs after each dish was cleared. we kept alex and ben up until almost am, and they made us feel welcome, even liked, while they waited on us hand, foot, finger, toe. we ordered two of the cheaper bottles of wine on the menu a  riesling and a  rioja instead of springing for the pairing, and we had no regrets. otherwise, we were offered no choices, once we confirmed that we suffered neither aversions nor allergies. the feast just poured in, blowing our minds one bite at a time. the first part of our meal was a poem in sea ink, opening with charred cured roe with coconut, carrot, and a curry yuzu reduction. other than the roe, nothing came in its original form, instead bringing soft textures that let the burst of roe take the tactile spotlight. the light, sweet, salty, currytinged dish set the bar high. then came a presentation of shellfish on malaysian driftwood draped with seaweed that told us the bar was there to stay. an oyster leaf confused and delighted, topped with a shallot mignonette. i hardly knew oyster could taste so much like oyster, never mind a single green leaf. king crab with passionfruit, pineapple, hearts of palm, avocado, rum, allspice, and vanilla provided a playful run of sweet and tropical flavors, with a juicy chunk of crab at its center. a long she will of razor clams marinated in xo sauce brought hearty asian flavors with soy, shiso, and daikon. i loved the way the firm chew of the clams was accented by an accompaniment of carrot and ginger tapioca. the last she will on the driftwood held one of my favorite bites of the night  sea urchin with banana sabayon, black truffle, and coarse salt. sweet, silky, earthandseascented perfection. seafood played a supporting role in the next course, which featured yuba, dehydrated and fried, wrapped around jumbo shrimp with chive, orange taffy, sesame seeds, and togarashi, dipped into a sweet miso emulsion. there was crunch, there was snap sesame seeds stuck to lips and tablecloth. while we enjoyed the yuba, we watched dashi brew in a siphon. the clear pot held seaweed, konbu, bonito, scallion, ginger, yuzu, and mirin, and when the broth was done, it was served with a delicate cube of scallop mousseline, fried to imitate agedashi tofu, garnished with cucumber, nasturtium, wasabi, carrot, chive, celery, and yuzu rind. the scallop was utterly delicious, with a slight crust and creamy insides. the broth and aromatics were irresistible, and i was glad when we got a cup of dashi to sip on. a long metal antenna impaled our next course, a bite of hungarian wooly ham and hibachigrilled squid, with sherry, orange, and fennel, which we plucked with our teeth. the tender squid fell just short of overpowering the ham, but they played together nicely. then we drank our centerpiece. it was filled with a sweet floral juice of beet, hibiscus, and italian licorice, which we had standing with glass straws. after that came an interlude of sicilian family style dining, a way for achatz to show that anything you can do, he can do better. moist, flaky, herb roasted atlantic scup came filleted over garlic basil mint puree, with sides of panella chickpea crackers and caponata, and a ramekin of sicilian sea salt. the fish was perfectly cooked, and fritters were fun and crunchy. the caponata was the ultimate rustic side, with firm eggplant and raisins, capers, olives, pine nuts, and celery. the scup also came with wine  a pouring of french chardonnay, in ornate glasses. "
1571,Camille P.,1130,5,1/22/12,"dinner at alinea is probably the craziest meal i have ever had. really. throughout the evening, my awe was expressed in many ways chair dancing, jaw to floor, moaning and groaning, and constant eye rolls of pleasure, just to name a few. there is no way i can come close to describing with any real accuracy the intricacies of this extraordinary experience so i hope you find my photos and commentaries at least entertaining. here are a few highlights the table's centerpiece was a live garden. yes, let us start there. a live garden, on a slab, dirt and all, center of the table. we were instructed not to do anything with it initially, but that it would come into play later in the meal. understood. first to arrive that we were allowed to eat was the steelhead roe with watermellon, kaffir lime and the cutest, teensiest, most delicate little cucumber with the blossom still attached. adorable. then a fried morsel on a vanilla bean. it is receptical was built specifically for the mad scientist, himself. then a massive seaweed platter holding  'sea' items. first was an oyster leaf in an oyster she will with a mignonette. that is right. there was actually no oyster at all.  just a leaf in a she will. tricky. then a raw scallop with an ale and old bay foam. increadibly more delicious than i can convey. then my first ever razor clam also with deliciousness too complicated to describe. next was this little stick. it was made from the skin that forms on the top of the 'whey' of tofu. they peeled it off and deep fried it, then wrapped it with a wonderfully sweet prawn, rolled it in sesame seeds and stuck it in a fancy aioli. who thinks of this stuff? then the english peas three ways. when this 'bowl' arrived, it was hot and cold all at once. you start with the top... then open it up to find the freeze dried stuff with olive oil blobs and grapes... then remove that section to discover a silkysmooth puree. unlike any pea soup i have ever had... i got quite excited for the next course when the marked our table with a pair of scissors. i knew i was going to get to snip away at that center piece. i was right. we added the baby chard, mizuna, thai basil, cilantro and more to our tomato heaven. it was like eating soup and salad at the same time. the flavor of the broth alone may have taken the cake for my fave course, and then add the fact that i get to play with my food by adding live lettuces and herbs snipped from our own table garden?! whaaaaa?!!! this is what they like to call handsfree dining. it is one little bite on a skewer that you simply remove with your mouth. yeah. fun. less important were the ingredients mackerel, mango, bergamot flower and who knows what else. then a little mushroom garden with a cream infused with pine yes, pine... as in 'cone' and a bunch of other interesting ingredients. i think they were going for a forestinyourmouth sensation. success. oh! and then there was hot potato, cold potato. a warm, creamy potato soup with a mini 'cold potato' on which a slice of black truffle rested. there was also a little cube of butter and parm on the mini skewer which melted into the soup upon removing the skewer from its resting place. all carefully dropped into the soup which was then gulped from the little bowl. this one was fun too. here's the fanciest little lamb dish you will ever see. i cannot tell you all of the components but i can tell you that this was one to merit the chair dance. wonderful! a favorite at the table and amongst achatz followers was the truffle explosion. a one bite raviolo filled with juicy truffle heaven. it rested on a spoon that sat in a bowl that had no bottom. yes, a bowl built only to hold a spoon. the garnish is a tiny romaine leaf, black truffle and shaved parm. ridiculously delicious. here's a whacky one. first, remove the glass plate containing a bunch of little garnishes like blackberry, fermented garlic and olives from its base. then construct a devise with the tools provided on which to hang the pasta that was somehow snuck to your table in the form of a second center piece. fill the pasta with decadent braised short ribs and strange garnishes of your choosing before wrapping it up and eating it like a taco. see, i told you it was whacky. you can barely see the little octopus tentacle resting next to a smooth, set eggplant puree with coriander and more. take the bite then wash it down with the frothiness in the bowl. this was the intermezzo to clear the palatte. coconut snow with yuzu. just do not lick it directly from the frozen metal or you will end up like ralphy from a christmas story. ouch. i loved this course, too! all kinds of crazy stuff that a normal person would never pair. there were squares of peach puree, basil, balsamic, jasmine, mozzarella, creme fraiche! i was like a kid in a candy store... i had so much fun mixing and matching flavors and textures! full review on blog."

1573,Me m.,1130,3,12/12/11,"the occasion our year anniversary. the destination the one, the only, the legendary alinea. the company our friends, firstrate foodies who were looking for the right excuse. we were shown to a nice table surrounded by four comfortable chairs. as soon as we sat, a cartoonlike timeshift occurred we slowed down while the staff around us went into a frenzy. they simply had no time. while i was in midsentence, they stepped in, placed a dish, explained the dish, and disappeared. all within a blink of an eye. we were left dumbfounded. where did these dishes come from? what were the secret ingredients? how were they used? so many questions unanswered. the process repeated again and again. dishes presented in haste. explanations mumbled. wine, seemingly unrelated to the food, was poured with little to no explanation. we never found out what two of the ten wines were. we tried. we really tried. we tried asking about the food. we tried asking about the wine. for our efforts we were rewarded with an additional five seconds of incoherent mumbling. my request to tell us more about the unusual caponata on my plate was answered the eggplant is not pureed. much of the magic was gone. the conversation centered on all but the food. ah, the food. yes, i almost forgot the food. twentycourses ranging from the absolutely divine to the downright mediocre were placed in front of us, in a rapid hour succession. from the heights of the razor  clam to the lows of the single oyster leaf. from a whitetruffled risotto a notch above perfection, to a truffled pasta a notch below. from the sea urchin the likes of which i have never had to the cold borscht that plagued the meals of my childhood. inconsistent would be the perfect word to describe our dining experience. presentation won at the expense of taste. dishes such as the squab were left for us to interpret and construct without the guiding wisdom of our host chef. the last desert, the dark chocolate, for all its pomposity was a meaningless collection of random tastes. we all agreed it simply did not work. the king is naked. imagine a scale where price and hedonism battle for gravity's reach. we came looking for the ultimate decadent dining experience. we knew that the sum paid would be beyond the realms of logic and justification  alinea complied. but the scales would not balance. the hedonistic animal within us left unsatiated and ashamed. the food did not reach the glorious promised peaks the service did not break the surface of polite friendliness curiosity was not satisfied. we will have to keep looking."
1574,Pilan C.,1130,5,10/24/11,"best. meal. ever. we made reservations  months ago. i saw how much it was going to cost, and it was going to be more than any meal i had ever eaten in my life. and i had heard amazing things from everyone who had been here before me. my expectations could not have been higher, and i am very happy to say that i walked out even more satisfied than i could have imagined. every dish was imaginative and creative, all featuring different ingredients  very few of the components of the  dishes were repeats  and a wide variety of preparations. many of the dishes had a whimsical feel to them, and the food runners all had a light sense of humor that kept the meal from being too stuffy, which you would expect from a place this fancy jackets required!!. only our sommelier was a bit too serious, but i guess that was understandable. as an example of the whimsy, there was a big pumpkin sitting at our table when we got there. when we were ready to start our meal, it looked like the waiter was taking the pumpkin off the table to make room for food, but when he lifted the pumpkin, there were four little squares of the most delicious pumpkin cake that i had ever had, with a bit of thai chili for kick  great way to start off our meal. that was followed my more and more delicious dishes, and there was not a clunker in the whole menu of  dishes! my favorites were a razor clam appetizer with xo sauce, the mushrooms with red wine sauce probably the best mushrooms i have ever had, a sicilian swordfish wheel, and the famous hot potato, cold potato and black truffle explosion. some dishes were small, some were larger, but the meal had so many of the best bites of food i have ever eaten before. the meal ended as uniquely as it started. the waiters came out and put a fancy, rubbery tablecloth on our wood table. then, two chefs came out with two coconutsized spheres made of chocolate and steaming, halloweenlike steins filled with liquid nitrogen. the two chefs poured the liquid nitrogen into the balls, and then followed that by covering the table with some mindblowing fallthemed sauces  a lingonberry sauce, a butternut squash syrup, and stout or porter reduction. the chefs then picked up the balls and dropped them on the table, chocolate bits and random stuff inside the balls flying everywhere on the table. it was like a frozen pinata, full of little treats like frozen french toast squares, nutmeg cotton candy, meringues, frozen cream cheese bits, and some other interesting, delicious bites that we dipped in all of the sauces. we ate it all right off the table, mostly with our hands. the meal took four and a half hours, but felt perfectly paced with impeccable service. we got the menus at the end, but i have debated many times whether i liked seeing the menu at the end, or whether i would have liked to have known what was coming. we had heard that there were  courses so we kept counting them, and did not really know how many more savory dishes were coming before desserts. only two drawbacks on the night  they do not have a full bar, so you cannot have a cocktail before or during your meal, especially considering all of the amazing cocktails i have heard are served at aviary and  the wine pairing was a ridiculous  per person, which was even more than the meal. while i love wine, i cannot justify paying that much for a wine pairing, especially when the meal is already expensive. we did, however, enjoy two delicious bottles of red wine that the sommelier helped us pick out. i cannot recommend alinea highly enough for a onceinalifetime meal and overall experience."
1575,Christine V.,1130,5,9/23/11,"best meal i have ever eaten in my life. not only is each dish presented in a unique & beautiful way, turning food into art, but each dish tastes as good as it looks! not a single dish was disappointing.  stars to each and every dish...only downside is that most of the courses are literally one bite. so after eating that bite, you wish you had more to enjoy, but that is it....just one bite. the meal is  courses, but you will not feel stuffed when you leave due to size of course. we went in a group of  max # they will take..and the experience lasted  hours. there are  sizes for wine pairings you can add  additional, or  additional for  the pour of each wine. it is too bad they do not have a nonalcoholic pairing. they had this cranberrypomegranate juice mix that was delicious...a little fizzy, a bit tart, but mostly sweet. this is the first restaurant i have been to without a sign! i guess it is so well known that it does not need any more attention than it already has...so do not be surprised if you drive by a regular looking building. only sign with the restaurant name is the valet sign. reservation process on the st of each month, phone lines open for booking  months later. you will have to call and hang up repeatedly until you get through...and when you do, you will be put on hold. but..it is worth it. regarding the meal see pics for each course no bread, no amuse busche. just start off with the first course and finish through. favorites mussel, razor clam , hot potatocold potato, black truffle explosion, & yuba. some of the dishes are very playful...as in you play with your food. others are displayed in a unique way, such as antennae, where the yellowtail snapper is hanging from a wire & you eat it without using hands. lemongrass looks like a minifishtank, or what reviews call food in a testtube. the ends are sealed with a jelly dragonfruit so the contents do not spill out. you suck on it like a straw and everything mostly liquid contents fall into your mouth. lastly, there is a dessert finale where they plate the whole thing on your table lined w silicon sheet. pay attention to the white liquid! small detail you might miss if you are not observant. when they put this liquid on the table, it forms squares, not circles like most liquids do!! super cool! the chocolate mousse dipped in liquid nitrogen tastes better when it melts a little bc it is similar to chocolate ice cream in the beginning, it has more of a dry crunch taste. it is also cool to watch them turn the banana cream liquid into creme brulee right in front of you. do not read on if you do not want surprise spoilers regarding playing with food. when we first sat down, our waiter brought us what he called centerpieces. looked like a little baby garden grown on a rock with soil. he told us it was for decoration...and not to eat or touch it. later, this centerpiece actually became our salad! they bring you a baby pair of scissors & you cut your own greens and place it in the bowl of dressing & tomatoes...which we originally thought was a soup. i loved the element of surprise. there is another dish short rib where you have to assemble the plate and add the ingredients to make your own giant ravioli. do not add too much salt...i mistakenly added all of each ingredient..which is fine..but do not add all of the salt. there is a dish called hot potatocold potato, where there is a pin that holds a fried hot potato ball on it among other things...you pull the pin down and out, and the hot contents fall into the cold potato soup below it and you take the whole thing like a shot so you have the sensation of both temperatures in your mouth. very cool. lastly, there is a dessert dish where there are different colored cubes which represent different flavors. you get to choose, mix & match the cubes, to blend the flavors in your mouth. choose wisely, bc not all combinations go well together..haha. after reading this, i might have ruined the surprises, but it will still be very fun. loved alinea, loved the food, the service, the art, everything. will definitely return one day."
1576,Magdalena H.,1130,1,10/29/18,"for as much as this restaurant charges, they pay their servers  an hour. worked with someone who worked there very shortly. as gratuity is included in the price per person, i am sure they are ripping off their customers as well as paying their servers a substandard wage. most people who would pay this price point to have a meal will not care about these things, but i would, do, and would not touch this place with a ten foot pole."
1577,Elveera K.,1130,1,9/29/18,"the performance of the meal does little to conceal the sad fact that the food does not perform it does not taste good. there was not a single dish that i finished, let alone would crave again. for starters, the menu has no congruity and is a mish mash of flavors rammed together for the sake of exposition rather than any flow. clam chowder to korean bbq? or how about the tragic assault on caviar  taking a beautiful and delicate ingredient and so bombarding it with smoke and other gimmickry that any essence of the caviar is lost. rather than showcase the flavor of high quality ingredients it seems like the chefs take a prop that they want to play with a bowl of fruit with smoke or palo santo wood and then plan ingredients around that. the rehearsed sales pitch of the waitstaff as they explain each course becomes a desperate plea to convince you that really cool stuff was done to your food in an attempt to preempt the disappointment the diner feels when tasting the finished product. additionally, the dishes are of a puzzlingly tepid temperature despite charcoal and fire table side. whether intentional or a lapse in expediting orders, it added to the decidedly underwhelming experience."
1578,Michael G.,1130,1,8/30/18,"being a customer here feels like booking a theme park tourist trap experience, completely void of any class, hospitality, service, or human touch. does not resemble a michelin star experience, and does not deserve any stars anymore. actually, i would rather deal with a theme park customer service center and eat at one of their buffets of marginal processed food, than deal with the crappy customer experience here that is a no starter right from the beginning. big downgrade for alinea. michelin stars not deserved. repeat customers are forced to impersonal online reservations, they do not answer their phone number for questions or take voice messages whenever i call, but they force you by a silly recorded message to the web whether you like it or not. after being on a waiting list for many days for a table to probably overpay for what was special and innovative  years ago, you get misled by an email that says reservations available, and fine print that a slot may be open that day, but then you are forced into another longshot online competition that you will likely waste your time on, and lose, if you have the same experience as me. they must make multiple wait list customers compete for open slots, so it almost seems like the wait list means nothing. what a poorly designed system. zero respect and no consideration for their customers. forget alinea. jacked up prices to the max, everything designed for the convenience of the business, and totally missing basic customer service standards. they are just in a big hurry to profit and take your money and exploit you, living off the former glory of achieving michelin stars they really do not deserve now. it is more like hearding animals than running a classy restaurant. zero stars. a sellout and discrace to chicago now. i hope and encourage their stars to go away. if you want to go and spend hundreds if not thousands of  on a dinner where you are not even treated with respect as a customer, be my guest. luckily chicago has so many options, that i can leave this place in the rear view mirror for the tourists and posers willing to compromise themselves here. please note multiple one and  star reviews interwoven between the overrated overhyped reviews. a great restaurant should not have these."
1579,Eli G.,1130,1,7/1/18,i have been anticipating going to this resturant for years before finally booking a table. a friend and i booked an entire trip to chicago revolving our visit. i have a sever allergy to dairy and peanuts and we notified them in advance. we had a several email coorispondence regarding my allergy. they were very clear that it should not be an issue and that accommodations would be made for me to dine safely. in the second course i began to go into anyphylactic shock and almost died that night. i did not expect this from a three michelin star restaurant.
1580,Eric W.,1130,1,5/3/18,"i have been to alinea several times and have always had an amazing experience. i love alinea. however, the restaurant seems to no longer place the diner first. one of the amazing things about michelin star restaurants is how personalized and accommodating the experience can be. alinea no longer seems to be one of those places. i needed a table for six for a particular night. i logged on right as they went on sale but because alinea only offers one table for six that is not the k kitchen table i was not able to get it. i reserved two tables one of , one for  at the same time in the same section of the restaurant for that night. after emailing alinea, i was shocked that they not only refused to move the tables next to one another, but went out of their way to ensure the tables would not even be in the same room. remember this is a restaurant that changes the entire table configuration in the gallery over the course of one meal this is not an impossible ask of them. their response it is the policy set in place by the chef and owner that we are not able to accommodate requests to seat duplicate tables near one another. movement and interaction between separate tables has proven to be disruptive to the flow of service for our team as well as the other diners. your two tables will be seated in separate dining rooms. for full disclosure they did offer me the opportunity to book the , kitchen table, but that would double the cost of an already expensive meal. when policy starts to win out over reasonable customer requests, a restaurant such as alinea has lost direction. alinea should look at the definition of its own name, a new direction, and start in a new direction of once again trying to delight the diner."
1581,Stephen R.,1130,1,2/26/18,this in an overpriced eating experience. if you like to throw money into the wind please do so and do not lose it here.
1582,Michael S.,1130,1,10/30/17,"extremely disappointing!! we group of  of us have been waiting for the opportune time to dine at alinea. finally,  months ago, we were able to get tickets at a time that worked for all of us october  @ .  it was a struggle to get tickets and i had to be standing by the keyboard as the clock struck .  i do not particularly like the ticketing system, but that is not up to me to manage their  areservations'. we booked for the kitchen table for  people  per person and were all very excited!! what a let down! it starts with the minute we sat down. the gentleman that came to introduce himself as our assistant for the evening was a bit awkward. there was also another gentleman there that was more of a wine steward. the first thing they explained to us was that we had an option to add white truffles to a few of our courses. this would be an enhanced 'experience' and is an additional  per person. and, if someone at our table of  chose that option, the whole table would have to do it. now, to me, that is pretty ballsyridiculous. you charge  to get in the door for what is supposed to be a great dining experience, then tell us if we want it to be really special we have to pay another pp, or .. that is ludicrous. needless to say, we passed on that. they also took that time to offer the wine pairings this made perfect sense. there were  options  was like  and the other  approximately. none of us at the table were up for drinking that much wine so we all declined. however, they never mentioned an option for wine by the glass. we had to ask about that, at which time they did bring out the winebeer list and we ordered a glass from that. now, on to the food.. the food, while interestingly presented, left much to be desired in terms of a true 'gastro' experience. too much foam, almost everything had gelatin and no single dish was that memorable for taste and presentation. i only remember  things that really caught me the smoking oranges and the dessertart. other than that, all of the courses just blended together. way too much foam which now is over played and the 'meat' that we had was really blah. there was a dish with trout and foam.. trout was unidentifiable and foam was overplayed. there was another dish with wagyu and veal wagyu, like the trout, was nothing special. the veal, however, was very good. finally, the artsy dessert was tasty nothing outstanding, but tasty. i do not want to go on and on, berating each course. it is not that the food is bad.. it is just not good and for what you pay to get in, it had better be at a minimum really good. for coursebycourse blows you can certainly read some of the other reviews. and, if the poor food was only one or two of the courses, this review would read much different. we just had a bad meal that disappointed all of us, falling well under the bar. to sum it up, you do get plenty of food and there is a pretty cool 'show' to go with it. however, the food is not tasty, playing too many of the same things they have been doing for a while. this dinner is, in no way, worthy of the price. it is unfortunate, as there seems to have been some really great times for alinea. october of  obviously is not part of that segment in time. i would love to say i would go back and give them another try. however, i do not know that anything would change. side note in a documentary we recently watched, it commented that chef grant is there every day. he was not present when we went that friday night."
1583,Tony S.,1130,1,8/25/17,"if you like mediocre food and rude service in a plain gray  meat locker room for an outrageous price then this is the place for you..... read all the reviews before you book, i did not and i paid the price. rude, rude, rude service and they turn the tables lightning fast, you definitely will leave feeling rushed. food is gimmick at best, sea bass was chewy, poor food quality some of it not even edible. oh and the dessert.. bubble gum... really! if this is their interpretation of avantgarde they missed the mark big time. do not waste your money go somewhere else. want to read more?..... ok after quickly checking out the reviews and seeing a few pics, this place looks amazing right?.... wrong.... had high expectation that all dissipated at table.....  booking the best marketing scam out there. they limit the tables offered so you feel lucky to get a table then when we got there the room was half empty.  ambiance plain, dull gray wall and cold  degrees cold room. honestly the bathroom was better decorated.  staff rude and they look beaten  disinterested kitchen staff. not once we were asked if we enjoying our food. the sommelier cannot even pour the correct measure, paid  for .oz glass of wine.  food oooh the food.......you will be greeted by a peace of lettuce wedged on top of a lime was sitting on the table for god knows how long. and the giant bowl of orange w the dry ice..... then it seems as they ran out of plates so the waiter present a tasteless micro pancake on a stick...... and so on...then the sea bass they cannot leave good enough alone, no harmony in the combinations over cooked, chewy and more inedible compensation of stuff in the bowl.... oh, oh and the poor attempt from the waiter to cook a potato that was buried in salt on our table....come on..... the plates looked good enough for pics for instagram but lacked harmony between ingredients and cohesion between the dishes. it is more gamic food and downhill experience from there. i sat there course after course in disbelieve is that it that is the best they can come up with the chef will redeem himself at the next course........wrong  price outrageous.....that is why you have to prepay because if they present you with that outrageous bill at the end of that highly disappointing experience you will never pay it. i guarantee you i would not.  management guilt ridden, very defensive and set in their own ways. do not bother complaining to quincy, nick or even grant. they have no problem taken you money and never explained the poor food quality or the rude service.... they will blame everyone one else before they look in the mirror. finally...if i ever feel the urge to have that experience again i will go ahead and schedule my colonoscopy as i am sure i will get the same level of satisfaction."
1584,T B.,1130,1,8/20/17,"we were charged about  for two people with taxes and  service charge. this amount is too little if you are in the  and too much if you are in the , aspiring for a taste of the life of . upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess. an usher walked us to our seats. once seated, a server greeted us and all of the guests with the same script after being seated. he was jaded and his performance was insincere. his role in the experience is to elegantly inquire if you are high worth guest i.e. if you will she will out person for a wine tasting. there was an amuse bouche resting on the table before we were seated. out of four servers on the floor, none bothered to inform us what it was. when the meal begins at such a high note it has only one place to go from there i.e. downwards. the courses were presented by disinterested kitchen staff, who mumbled while describing the dishes and were offended when asked to repeat. the dishes were not memorable and lacked flavor and seasoning. all of the accolades have numbed the taste buds of the chef and his staff. the dishes are good for instagram. the meal ended with two desserts both of which were lackluster. one of the dishes was presented with a bed of salt. none of the staff bothered to clean the salt on the table for the rest of the evening. if the diner has been coerced to pay  service charge, then the diner can not ask for hisher money back, if the service is not good. i would ask grant to let the diner decide if the service they received was worth  tip. during the two hour experience, the staff sarcastically asked us about our opinions on some of the dishes. buddy, if you are not excited about your own food, then it makes me look like a fool paying high prices for a meal you do not believe in. temper your expectations, since both people and food are gimmicky here. it is a great marketing tactic to create a sense of scarcity by making the reservation hard to come by. the mediapr has hyped up the place. the chef is focused on expanding his restaurant empire by opening more restaurants in chicago and other cities rather than offering a good experience to the diners at alinea. if you decide to dine here, then know that you are not paying for the food, service, or ambiance you are paying for one thing and one thing only i.e. the brand grant achatz."
1585,David H.,1130,1,7/11/17,"first time dining at alinea since remodel, second time dining here overall. first experience was as perfect as a fine dining experience could possibly be  mind blowing even  dinner a couple of nights ago however was incredibly disappointing. evenings at restaurants of this caliber are often likened to a night at the theater every dish and glass of wine is served with its own story every move of the wait staff appears to be precisely choreographed the sheer visual artistry of each course exciting, unique textures and flavors. it only makes sense that establishments such as these would forego a typical reservation scheme in favor of a ticketing system... it is worth noting, however, that service aka tip is included in ticket price up front. the attitudes of the wait staff were very clearly either unhappy to be there or simply indifferent. plates were brought out to each member of our party somewhat haphazardly  some of the nicer restaurants at casinos in detroit manage to coordinate this better. for several courses we were told nothing about the wine pairings. for several courses our water glasses were empty. the cuisine was remarkably underwhelming  the first course spear tasted like windex. constituent portions of subsequent courses were variously frozen, pured andor smoked this certainly added to theatrics but did not necessarily add anything positive to the dishes themselves. after edible balloons were brought out copies of the word jumblemenu were placed on the table then we were ignored until we guessed it was time to leave. the meal was an entirely unsatisfying procession of what seemed to be poorly executed gimmicks, each more disheartening than the last. i have to think that our experience here was affected by the fact that chef achatz was in new york working on other projects, but admittedly this is mere conjecture. regardless we coordinated a trip across country and dropped ,. on dinner for four plus two cookbooks and it just was not good. a year ago we had a similarly disappointing experience in yountville but i could not bear to write that review. no surprise then to see these restaurants continue to slip further down the world's best list. think i am going to finally give up on fine dining for good now."

1587,Aryn F.,1130,1,5/23/17,"my boyfriend and i had dinner at alinea on july th, . i just wanted to write to express my disappointment. i had been looking forward to this meal for months. i made my boyfriend buy tickets the second they went on sale, anticipating the best dining experience i would enjoy in this lifetime. i expected the food to be innovative and interesting. i also expected that i would not necessarily enjoy everything, but i did not expect what happened. the meal did not start out well. i ordered a glass of wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer. i understand beer may not be the drink of choice for such a meal, but he brews beer and it is what he enjoys drinking. the sommelier overturned the beer into the glass and poured an entire glass of foam. if you do not want to serve beer, do not put it on the menu, but what happened was unacceptable at any restaurant, nevermind one of this caliber. i should have prefaced this by saying that my parents had dined at alinea less than a year before and raved about it. we all eat out quite a bit and are what you could consider food snobs. since my parents had excellent things to say, i thought the meal would be worth the price. however, we were fed course after course of disappointing food. i have to say that we were served mostly vegetables. there was very little food of substance and i left the restaurant slightly hungry, which i would have thought inconceivable for the amount of money we paid. the only food of substance was a piece of pork belly  of which was fat. i understand this is a fatty food by nature, but i have had much better pork belly at many restaurants across the country. there was also rabbit that was hard to identify as such. there were some notably horrible moments. we were served the hot potatocold potato dish, which was served in a wax bowl. the fragility and material of the bowl was not well explained and my boyfriend ended up ingesting a large piece of wax. to say that it did not pair well with hot and cold potatoes would be an understatement. the server was not particularly contrite about this incident. the helium balloon was also another sour moment. the first balloon that was brought to my boyfriend had a large hole in it that was clearly visible so it deflated immediately. the waiter insisted that he had simply not eaten it quickly enough and grudgingly brought another. there was also one course that included pieces of hamachi next to a campfire. i have to say that it was not even close to the best piece of yellowtail i have ever had. i expected everything to be the best of the best. we ate at joe's steak and stone crab later in our vacation and everything we ate during that meal was better than one single thing we ate during the course of our meal at alinea. that does not add up to me. joe's is fantastic but i thought alinea would be the best meal of my life. i felt as though we were being punked or had checked the vegan option by mistake, that was how poor the meal was. when i look back on the money we spent, i am horrified and saddened. i have to say that i would never recommend this restaurant to another human being and that upon hearing of our experience, my parents said they will never go back. at the price, it is not worth the risk of a horrible meal."
1588,Ruchira R.,1130,1,1/5/17,"highly over rated. it is not worth it for vegetarians at least. from the google pictures i saw i assumed that everyone got their desserts made on the table. however, their new policy is that whoever eats at the gallery is the only one who experiences the table dessert. there was no 'wow' factor at all. sixteen at the trump hotel was much better in terms of food. highly disappointed."
1589,Irene X.,1130,1,11/24/16,"totally not worth the money. very disappointing. total joke! i want to say these words out loud so many times after having a chance to experience the wholly expensive tasting menu at the alinea !!! i could not believe myself after waiting for  months and finally be able to sit and have their tasting menu & wine pairings  for the meal  domesticintenational wine plus tax plus service charge at the galeria, that this is the worst experience i have ever had among all other  michelinstarred restaurants in the country that i have been to. having a very expensive meal at  michelinstarred restaurant, without any doubts, everyone's expectation is the service, meal & beverages and the overall experience should be superb. sadly, it did not happen at the alinea. first of all, the guy who was in charged of pouring the wine, was not friendly at all and the worst thing was, every single bottle of wine that he poured to my glass was only a sip size of volume. i have finished every single wine before the food came, therefore, i totally do not think i have experienced the food and wine pairings at the alinea. secondly, the menu was laid out on a piece of paper with about  different unique names, just their way to try to surprise and impress us with the food they will serve, without giving out all the details about the descriptions of the dish. unfortunately, every single dish that came to our table did not impress us. at. all. zero. for a three michelinstarred restaurant at least i would expect there would be at least caviar, lobster, abalone in one of the dish. what we got was mostly cheap ingredients! a total joke! all dish was served in a tiny portion with mostly sweet, creamy sauce and among  courses there were  dessert which were chocolates and ice cream. are you kidding us? we are coming here to spend over  worth of meal not to have ice cream or chocolates !!! the other courses that are really disappointing are fry a deep fried of icefish with orange mandarin sauce. to be honest, almost all fish dish served in chinese food restaurant tastes better than this. yellow  pork belly. curry. banana. served in a tiny yellow flexible plastic bowl with a few very dry, tiny pieces of pork belly covered with yellow curry sauce. a total joke! the pork belly you can get from a lot of food trucks taste much better than this dish and the size is a lot bigger too! paint  cherry. white chocolate. bourbon. nothing exceptional here, does not matter how good the paintings the chef was trying to do, this main item in this dish basically just white chocolate. bone  wagyu beef served on top of bone marrow. a good wagyu should just melted in your mouth. instead, the wagyu here was flavorless, did not melt in my mouth. petal glass  purple allium, black pepper, onion. lapsang souchong. maitake. the biggest item and served in the most generous size was the purple allium flowers which were inedible. finally, again, totally not worth the  !!!"
1590,Paulette G.,1130,1,8/10/16,"i have to admit that i was so excited to visit this restaurant. it is beautiful. the food looks like a piece of art. i have to give it one star because of the fly in my food!! when i brought it to the attention of management, they acted as if it were no big deal. offered to get me another plate. how can a place of this reputation act as if it is not a big deal that there was a fly in my food!!!"
1591,Elizabeth M.,1130,1,8/7/16,the worst experience i had at any  star restaurant! for the money i spent and the fact that this restaurant had  michlian stars you would think it be worth it but it was not ! the service was terrible ! the servers were cussing at our table and had no idea what dishes were what and what it even was! two of my friends flew from other states to come to experience this restaurant with me and they feel very disappointed in the experience and cheated out of their  plus money and we had informed the manager of the terrible service who could even care less! all of my friends and i work in the restaurant industry in  star hotel restaurants and know how a good quality service supposed to be and this was far from it! they did not apologize or do anything to accommodate us! what a waste of money ! it was not worth it at all! will not return and will let others know to not even waste a single time or dime here!
1592,Christa M.,1130,1,8/21/15,i was incredibly excited for this experience. unfortunately it was hands down the worst dining experience of my life. i do not have a problem spending a lot of money on a meal and have thoroughly enjoyed other highend dining experiences like bryan voltaggio's table  at volt. the key difference here is that the food did not taste good at alinea and was not memorable. considering the price tag of this experience...just not worth it...very very sad....i also had a very awkward incident with a staff member...do not waste your time or money...
1593,Lisa S.,1130,1,5/24/15,bland overpriced food and extremely arrogant service. i am not sure how they earned any stars unless pretentiousness counts.
1594,Jimmy Z.,1130,1,5/11/15,"i hate to write a bad review but in this case i feel like i have to warn the public. i can not be more disappointed! being a self proclaimed foodie and having dined at many  michelin star restaurants in my life, this was by far the worst. i really wanted to like this place since it is the number  best restaurant in the world. but, the food was just a terrible let down. maybe we caught it on the wrong menu rotation but me and my date could not believe this is the best restaurant in chicago. out of the  dishes, only the cold potato hot potato made sense to me. everything else was just flat out bad. the service was good but could not make up for how bad the tasting was. go to sixteen, even tho  stars, best meal in chicago!"
1595,Giang-Tien M.,1130,1,5/10/15,"we celebrated my birthday in this threestarred michelin restaurant. the restaurant's entrance was original and mysterious thanks to the exquisite lighting in the long corridor. we thought it was extremely overpriced for the food we got. there was a lot of effort to make the presentation original. nevertheless, the combination of flavors was off for striving too hard to be distinctive. the dishes did not tasted truly good. it was the case even for the dessert. a lot of fluff, but not any outstanding and unusual flavors on our plates. the service was good, but the atmosphere of the restaurant seemed pretentious overall."
1596,Robert P.,1130,1,1/9/15,"not worth the money. we went here with high hopes. we have been to the french laundry , gary dankos and eleventh and madison this year. i have been looking forward to going to alinea for a few years but we just have not been able to schedule it, i was not impressed with the food, service or overall experience. i will not go back i find it hard to believe that the locals or anyone that is well traveled will go back to this average at best. it was more a circus sideshow then food. the best part of the meal was the caviar, all others were a joke at best. we had a better meal at lunch at blackbird. next time we will try  grams they were closed. the service needs to be addressed at alinea it was very bad."
1597,Mansi A.,1130,1,1/3/15,"worst meal of my life!!! so i spent  on a meal for  which was by far the worst meal i have had in my entire life. food the only thing we got in every course was root vegetables and vinegar. they all tasted the same. there was no variation in the courses, just the same  root vegetables dipped in vinegar st course spoonful of foam that looked and tasted similar to handwash nd course  tiny beans floating in a pool of vinegar th course random unheard of raw root vegetable pieces enough to satisfy the appetite of my hamster either dipped or sprayed with vinegar service worse than your local mcdonalds. even after mentioning that we did not like the vinegar soup, they added vinegar in every subsequent  courses. after every course i made sure to inform them that the food was so acidic the response we got at the end of the night was that the restaurant does use acidic recipes and that is just how it is. not even an apology. we left most of the food uneaten on our table ambience. whaaaat? beware this is not a restaurnt. its a tiny house with  tables in a bedroom sized room behind a dark backalley. my view for the entire dinner was the open kitchen and its  chefs running around. bottomline i would not go here again even if the restarant paid me  to go back. if you do go here, be prepared to eat a lifetimes worth of root vegeatbles and drink more vinegar than you have in your whole life."
1598,Garvey C.,1130,1,12/8/14,"quite disappointing. ideas and concepts are quite stale and have not been refreshed in years. other restaurants have started to take these ideas and have done a better job executing them or improving upon. however, the most disappointing aspect of the experience was the service. given the cost of the meal and the reputation of the establishment, the staff cannot be rude, smug and impolite. for example, several people at our table did not like the taste of parsley and stated that at the beginning of the meal. the kitchen instead replaced this herb with cilantro, which has a very similar taste to which a novice chef would be confused with. instead of taking this opportunity to educate us on the differences and similarities btw parsley and cilantro, he took every chance he could to correct us on how we never identified the difference for him. this unacceptable approach to the situation was the first of many that started to turn me off with the place. other examples include his impatience on waiting for us to decide on the wine pairings and the  truffle dish that all at the table must get if one person would like to try. not only did he not allow us an opportunity to discuss amongst the table, he showed annoyance when we asked that it would be best if he just simply gave us  minutes and come back later. the worst was when we found a fish scale in one of the dishes. that is absolutely unacceptable for any restaurant, much less a three star michelin establishment!! actually, i stand corrected...the absolute worst was how one of the waiters responded when we told him. he looked confused, did not know how to handle the situation, simply said i am sorry and walked off. it was never addressed by anyone after that. i have had much better service at an olive garden by high school aged servers. unacceptable!"
1599,Me Y.,1130,1,9/27/14,i wish i could give no star. dish is taste like crap. i do not understand why everyone rate this restaurant so highly. maybe because they spend thousand dollar in the restaurant and refuse to admit they got robbery like a person with no brain attached.
1600,Julie K.,1130,1,9/8/14,"can i give zero stars? i cannot believe the poor customer service my husband and i received at alinea. as you all are probably aware, to go to alinea, you need to participate in their ticketing system, whereby you must purchase tickets months in advance. in june, we bought tickets to celebrate our anniversary over labor day weekend. we had no way of knowing that when we bought these tickets, it would be for the same weekend we would have to put our dog to sleep. i contacted ashlan at alinea on wednesday our tickets were for sunday. we knew the end would be coming, and we would be in no shape to celebrate, let alone be up for something like alinea. ashlan told me that my only option was to go to alinea's facebook page and try to sell the tickets myself or lose the tickets. if i found someone to buy the tickets, alinea would not transfer the fees due, so in essence, we would also have to meet the people buying the tickets beforehand to get the money and then make the transfer. our dog was dying. we you are taking care of someone, human or animal, who is dying, you are an emotional mess and the care consumes every moment you have. you are constantly caring for them. i received her email on thursday. we put our dog to sleep on friday. so somewhere between caring for our dying dog on friday, then during our raw grief on saturday, we were supposed to become ticket brokers, putting our tickets up for sale, monitoring facebook for responses, emailing interested parties, and then hop in our car to go meet the buyers, make the transfer, etc. all while we just lost our beloved dog. i wonder if anyone at alinea has ever lost anyone important to them. do they know what pain and grief feel like? or did they want another babygate incident where we show up regardless of our situation, and bawl through the meal, ruining it for everyone around us, just because we paid for the tickets and they gave us no other options? in the end, we just gave our tickets away to friends. we were focused elsewhere, as you can imagine. to make matters worse, ashlan's last email to me, stated that i should let her know if we had any problems rebooking in the future. this woman honestly thinks we would rebook after this? seriously? get over yourself. the most appalling part? she closes her email with, have a lovely weekend. does this woman understand that our dog just died? is she a human or a robot? does she have any customer service training? we could have easily been booked for another night. alinea consistently puts tables up for sale on their facebook page, with less notice than we had given, and they sell. we know that if we did not go they would do just that put up our table for sale again and made an additional  on it. what really got me was that while looking for an email address for alinea to complain to them about their lousy customer service, i found an interview with grant achatz after the whole crying baby incident. he talks about how they accommodate people who call ahead with issues all the time. he goes on to explain that when the polar vortex happened, people got stranded and could not make their reservations and they refunded their tickets. are you kidding me? i emailed conrad reddick, the gm and explained to him what happened. and you know what the response was? nothing. he never even responded. i never expected this to happen to us at a three michelin starred restaurant. i think they just really do not care because they do not have to. people are clamoring to get in to alinea. once you buy those tickets, they do not care about you. but, you know who will respond about alinea's lousy customer service? michelin. they encourage feedback from diners who have experience with the restaurants they rate. i emailed them about this experience and they responded to me. i encourage everyone who has had bad experiences to email them, too. they consider feedback when rerating restaurants. it is funny because after this incident, i started looking on here at their bad reviews and most of them are related to customer service. please read the negative reviews before you buy tickets. there are so many fine dining establishments with amazing food in the city that do not behave this way. do not book here. things can happen in your life, no matter how you plan ahead and they do not care. they will just take your money. we are shocked to be treated so poorly during such an emotionally raw time while alinea has publicly claimed to make accommodations for others in far less tragic circumstances. and regardless, i do not care if you will be eating soup made from unicorn tears. when you are paying  for a meal, you should never be treated this way. we visit all the michelin rated restaurants and thought this one would top them all. i think wendy's would have shown us more kindness. their food might be amazing, we will never know. we know the same cannot be said for their customer service."
1601,Mister M.,1130,1,7/16/14,"aesthetically pleasing. however, i need more than that when it comes to what goes into my stomach. if i want this much art i will visit a gallery."
1602,Ira A.,1130,1,2/7/14,"this is the first review i ever wrote, but i feel so strong about it that i just had to share my experience so others would make their own decision. i booked reservation few month in advance for me and my husband to celebrate my birthday, paid over  for it, was very excited to experience the fine and exquisite dining! the good i really want to start with the bad but trying to stay fair the ambiance, very relaxing, soft lights. the staff very attentive, the knew it is my birthday and congratulated me several times, they knew about all the dietary restrictions we both had. presentation of the food is beautiful. deserts were very good not  good but good the bad food! the first  courses left a soap taste in our mouth. really. what ever tasted ok on the next courses was in the size of my half pinky. we would leave hungry if not a desert. for that much money, and i have no problem to pay for something that is worth it, the food should taste good, instead we had a soap taste and tooth paste. now if you do not have money to waist  find your self a different place to go. if you have the money and you want to pay it to look at a beautiful presented plates, good desert  go ahead. but if you saving money for that evening  i would not do it. we did not ordered wine pairing at  per person but had  maybe  half glasses of wine and  tea and ended up with additional .. bottom line  for people that like to eat a good food  not worth it."
1603,Jay R.,1130,1,2/2/14,"i have pondered writing this review for over  years now, yes  years, and have finally decided to purge my soul here on yelp of the less then perfect experience i had at alinea. my wife and i went to alinea for a very special occasion dinner celebrating a birthday and our engagement, we had both been looking forward to this dinner with every taste bud we had. the problems started when a dish arrived which contained cilantro, my wife has a horrible reaction to cilantro and nothing taste right to her after she eats even just a small bite. i called one of the numerous servers that waited on us that night to explain the problem, she was very understanding and whisked both our dishes away, in a short time she brought back one plate with out cilantro for my wife and mine with the cilantro how it was meant to be served, perfectly handled. we where enjoying our meal and another course arrived that again contained cilantro. not just a sprig but many tiny pieces of micro cilantro sprinkled liberally over the top of the dish. i again called one of our servers over and told him about the problem, this was a different person then helped correct the problem the first time. i was shocked to hear him say its only a garnish you can pick it off. i started to speak up and my wife who hates any kind of scene said its fine ill just pick it off. i did not want to ruin the mood and great time we where having on this special dinner so we continued on with our dining adventure. it is crazy that a restaurant of this caliber and price tells you to remove something you cannot eat yourself. how are we to know the cilantro does not go deeper in the dish. the request for cilantro should of been noted after the first incident and never made it onto my wife's plate again. numerous times we dinned at restaurants from upscale to very modest and cilantro had shown up on a dish but was not listed on the menu and the server gladly took the dish remade it and brought it back. a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the one server who told us to pick off the cilantro was the weakest link effecting the entire chain. we went on with our meal and at the end of the night were given a menu, a nice touch that would make it easy to recall the courses we ate as there was so many. not until we arrived home did we see we where not served a course, the butterscotch bacon course and the accompanying wine pairing!!! how could we have not noticed this we had dreamed of this dish since we heard of alinea. both my wife and i are bacon lovers and looked so forward to it. i guess we where overwhelmed with so many courses and the magical celebration. it bothered me so much i had to write a letter to alinea. i told them of the issue with the cilantro and the missing bacon course that we had dreamed of. six weeks had passed so i called to see if they received the letter. after being on hold a while i was told yes they had the letter but the person who would be in charge of this type of problem was out of the country for a while. really so they cannot deal with it thru email or better yet delegate it to someone else or at a minimum tell use they received the letter and that they would get back to us instead of making us chase them down. so i waited and maybe another month passed and no word so i called again. at this point i was so appalled at alineas follow up and customer service to a issue like this it made me feel taken advantage of, like they did not value our business or thought they where to good to have to deal with the problem. all the wonderful reviews and accolades who cares about one regular guy if he has a problem. well finally about  months after i wrote the letter did i received a response. they said they where sorry they strive to be better and appreciate us letting them know about the issues and apologize for the problem. they summed it up by saying they hope to get the chance to make it up to us. seriously, i do not go out to dinners like this more then maybe once in my life. it is not like i just will stroll in on my walk home and grab a quick bite. so here is how i look at it, the cilantro was a error i can forgive but the missed course is not. if i went to the grocery store and bought a dozen eggs and when i arrived home and saw there was only  eggs the grocery store would give me the missing egg, and probably say here is a new whole dozen for your inconvenience. so what should of alinea done? they should of given me my missing egg that is all they had to do, before service if they would of invited us in and served us the missing bacon course and the wine pairing i would not be harboring  years of ill feelings about such a special night."
1604,Steve K.,1130,1,11/22/13,"so, i just came back to check up on this review... and it was missing. i looked throughout all the reviews... i do not know how they are trying to cover this up, but this seriously needs to be addressed. here it is again. where do i begin? a little background about me is that i have been to several michelin recommended,  star and  star michelin restaurants around the world, some at chef's table experiences, so i was very excited coming to this three star michelin restaurant as i have never been to one with this standing before. i have read plenty of reviews on this site and saw several low ratings and disregarded them as oddities. however, after being there myself this past week i would have to agree with all the low ratings. i will sound like an egotistical food snob, but i have to believe that people who gave alinea  stars were dazzled by their presentation and were either tricked into believing what they ate was in fact a delicious meal or had to lie to themselves to justify the price. i will go into my experience at alinea from the beginning. first the ambiance. everything about alinea screamed a great attention to detail. from the moment of finding their hidden restaurant as i saw no bright sign to indicate it is location to the heavy front door that gave the feeling of exclusivity, to the automatic sliding door in the foyer giving it a contemporary feel, i have to give alinea's presentation a good score. some failures in feel however were the chairs. though the chair was comfortable, it is structure was reclined and the cushion was not firm, but rather let me sink in, making me have to lean back. i found that it was quite uncomfortable while eating. now before everyone think's it is because i am overweight, i am not. i am a  pounds ' male. for a  hour  course meal, this is a very big negative. another failure is the table placement. due to some of the courses having strong scents, it was quite clumsy of their design to seat people so close to each other. i felt that it interfered with my personal experience. again before people start their raving, you must understand that this is a three star michelin restaurant experience. where all aspects of the culinary skills are being appreciated. second their service. the service at alinea was quite excellent. the doorman was prompt, the entry host took my party's coats asked if we would need a cab at the end of the dinner and seated us politely and efficiently. we were greeted at our table and received an explanation of the night and wine pairing choices. throughout the night we received ample attention without being smothered, which is always a fine balance. i would give alinea an excellent rating on service. third the food. i will break this down to several parts and be brief. visual visually alinea's presentation is very good. some of the dishes are plated in a stunning fashion that i feel are there to distract you, but yes i admit that the presentation was very good. smell it was a hit or miss depending on what my neighbors were having. seriously, tables were so close that i was able to converse with them. taste ok, so this is the most important component in my opinion. everything else is to set the mood for this moment...and i feel that alinea fails to meet the standards of a three star michelin restaurant. i got the lower cost wine pairing with my meal and some dishes were completely distasteful without drinking the paired drink. my second dish that i received was so bitter that i had to drown out that taste with a very sweet wine that was paired with it. now, i might have a strange school of thought, but when i think of a pairing, it is a complement to a dish to make it better, not a subtitute for a poorly tasting dish. this happened throughout the meal where the dish was completely off and i had to drown out the taste with the paired drink. final thoughts having experienced several great michelin restaurants around the world, i was very disappointed with my experience with alinea. they were creative in their approach to form an experience, but they failed to capture my praise. i would recommend people not waste their money at this establishment as your culinary adventure will leave you disappointed and still hungry at the end. for the cost, they deserve a one star review for not making their food taste delicious regardless of ambiance. this experience has left me surprised that the standards to receiving a michelin star, and even more so for three stars in the united states is low. my past favorite restaurants if people can travel i would recommend ciel bleu in amsterdamn, ultraviolet in shanghai, thoumieux in paris. edit also, i was confused why i did not get my menu in the beginning of my meal and i was very disappointed that it was not signed by the chef. it would take him  minutes to do as his patrons are all paying for tickets in advance"
1605,Sonia L.,1130,1,6/4/13,"i travel by myself often, but still frequent highend restaurants in the you.s. and abroad. i have even dined at a guy savoy establishment in paris on new year's eve by myself and been treated with respect and cordiality and it was a great time with superb food.  however, i will never be able to know what the food at alinea is like as they do not accommodate single diners. when i inquired about dining at alinea via email, i was told i had to buy two seats you are actually purchasing a table... i was told. i am appalled at this. i do not feel anyone should have to pay extra just because they are single or are dining with an odd number of people. not even the great joel robuchon at his flagship establishment in las vegas or daniel boulud at daniel in ny or eleven park madison or...or...or required me to purchase a table.  shame on alinea!"
1606,Martin L.,1130,1,5/29/13,"i think alinea and next can stick there e tickets up there butt. they charge a mortgage payment for the privilege to eat in hyped up restaurants that are overrated. suggestion to owner, get over yourself. marty"
1607,Diana Y.,1130,1,5/15/13,"i want to preface by saying i really wanted to like alinea. the creativity and service are all  stars, but food was just a big disappointment. of all the michelin star restaurants i have tried, this is the priciest and my least favorite. best would probably be  madison since everyone here has already raved about the food, i will just focus on what did not work for me. i came in feb. so walking in you go through a little grove of pine trees and emerge to the restaurant. simple and chic. they have you wait a little with an amusestarter of hot chocolate infused with what i can only imagine as the same pine trees that we walked through. my first thoughts were, this is too sweet and i do not particularly like the taste of pine trees with my hot chocolate. creative, yes. taste, not at all, it reminded me of christmas pine scented candles. i pushed that out of my mind as i figured the rest of the meal would be fabulous. the time we came, the menu seemed to have a lot of asian influence. one set of the courses was a beautiful tower of water with flowers and ice. they then served a couple of pieces of sashimi fish skewered on lemon grass and two slices of raw scallop. you are to dip in the hot broth that is accompanied with it and there was also a hot stone that you can cook on. very interactive and fun, but taste wise i was underwhelmed. i have had scallops in many forms, this was two slices that i felt i could have gotten at any nice sushi restaurant. there was a soy dipping sauce for the fish, that was to my liking, but it is also exactly the same thing that my dad makes at home with a whole steamed fish, nothing new here. there was also a fried shrimp head, again, available at any sushi restaurant. to me it was not inventive and the flavors has been done, i came here to taste things that i have never tasted before and half the courses ended up being things i can eat on a regular basis at home. there was also another mushroom dish, the waiter took time to describe it, it is not a common known mushroom, huitlacoche, but again i have had it before, at a street taco stand, the mushroom tasted similar, i was not wowed by street taco mushrooms. there was a mole inspired dish, that was my bf's favorite. that was probably the mexican theme part of the meal. we also had the duck three ways with the assortment of saucessides. this was fun to try and pleasing to the eye, but not delicious as i had hoped.  of the sauces were inedible to me and made no sense as something that would pair well with duck, i felt like it is just put on there because it is different. the duck was also not the best. there was foie which i was looking forward to, but it was a small abysmal piece. gary danko had the best foie too bad not anymore. there was a palate cleanser of ginger. literally  tiny pieces of ginger on metal skewers, the concept failed me, barely half a bite if you put it all together and i did not like any of the flavors. to me it actually killed my palate because some of the pieces the ginger flavor was just too strong. dessert was also a fail. it was these three sorbetice cream flavors, but all i can remember is that one of them was carrot flavor. and it tasted just like that, cold creamy carrot flavored baby food. ended with the elaborate show of the frozen chocolate ball and ice cream made on your table. fun to watch, not fun to eat. the flash freezing of the ice cream did not create a good mouth texture of the ice cream and also ruined the pieces of cake that was in there as well. the dishes that i actually enjoyed seemed to be some permanent ones. the hot cold potato and the mushroom ravioli. each one the flavors were very intense for the small package it came in. i also liked the helium balloon, fun and delicious. overall, left hungry still bf ended up scarfing down leftover fried chicken and indian food later that night and disappointed at the meal we had. everything was pleasing to the eye, but in the end, we eat with our mouths and the flavors did not live up to their looks."
1608,Ky J.,1130,1,4/13/13,"first, let me be clear  we never got to eat at alinea. i am sure the food would have been fantastic. we were excited to find they had availability on an evening that i would be in chicago to visit my daughter and her boyfriend. when we tried to make reservations, however, we were told they only accepted tables of ,  or . no odd numbers?!?! this meant we either had to leave someone at home, add someone we did not really want to the dinner, or eat the cost for a ghost person. not acceptable."
1609,Nancy S.,1130,1,3/22/13,"i really did not enjoy this experience and in fact almost walked out. it took forever between courses so you wait an eternity for what is often a single bite, especially when the second sitting is arriving be prepared to wait an hour for the next course. i explained that truffles are only in moderation for me. i could not eat most of the greasy, oily goo presented as real food. i tried to taste one of the very potent truffle dishes, instead of taking it all in one huge bite as directed they came running over and confiscated it from me. i gave the replacement dish to a dining partner, since i could not see if i liked it before being made to stuff the whole thing into my mouth. unfortunately that made it an hour and a half between my last  small bites of food and my next  small bites of food. we tried to alleviate our hunger we had saved up our appetites for this with wine. our final tab was over  a head and i had to try to not leave starving by eating too much desert something i do not usually care for. overall, i will say it was my most disappointing gourmet if you can call it that dining experience. give me places in spain, france, etc... any day!! i feel bad for the people who succumb to heard mentality thinking i heard it was amazing!. and i am not cheap, i will pay for friends to all go to copenhagen and eat at noma a real restaurant. it is baffling how many people fall for this kardashianesque'cool'."
1610,Bobby G.,1130,1,1/6/13,"for the price i paid here i could have flown to switzerland, rented a chalet, and had a private chef for a week. but no instead the all my recently divorced friends decided to go to this frankenstein restaurant. why would i want to eat edible styrofoam?  what a damn waste."
1611,Bill W.,1130,1,11/20/12,"sorry, but after dining at lo i just do not see why i should spend over . on this nonsense. half of the courses were delicious, the rest were just like the emperors old clothes. i just went to boka for a  liter dinner with chefs from moto, yusho, tru and trencherman. give me those places any day of the week with truly delicious and creative food. leave this stuff out of it. wine pairings are insanely expensive and really do not pair well with the seasonless food. one other thing  who serves tomatoes at the end of october? get it together. these guys clearly have someone they are paying well for good pr. one also must ask ones self, is it worth all of the trouble in buying a ticket with no refund? these people actually expect you to pay upfront with tax, tip and gratuity. if you are like me and you did not care for the experience, then oh well, i am out a  gratuity on mediocre service and food. so not worth it people. this restaurant is full of itself and their ticket system is proof positive. on top all this, the ginger, truffle explosion and other dishes have been around for years. this menu needs to change over more often. they pride themselves on seasonal product but how can that be with so many stagnant dishes? alinea used to be great. with next and a failing bar called aviary this place is taking a nosedive. they should focus on serving their loyal guests more and all of the other dumb shit less."
1612,Georgetta E.,1130,1,11/3/12,"hype yes. that is about it.. opening time promptly at . do not arrive early. they will turn you away. food was there food? or just foam and jelly? big fan of fine dining and new american but this was over the top. the hot potato  cold potato dish was probably good but i burned my mouth  badly. the waiter was very insistent that it was time sensitive and must be taken in one bite. then you should warn patrons there is something really hot in that little wax sphere on which sits the course. my mouth was still feeling the effects the next day. this really took the professionalism of the the staff, restaurant and chef down a notch. the first course was cider immediately inside the door you are to enjoy the  steps it takes to give them your coat. no clue until i saw it on the menu that was part of the meal. best bite on the menu truffle explosion. though this too was touted as a shooter and must be taken in one bite quickly as it explodes. delicious  just wish the best part of the meal could be savored. service pretentious as a  tip is required and prepaid. that is right. tip is prepaid. i always tip above and beyond for service but prepaying makes it a salary not to insure proper service. dessert final course is served off a sheet of rubber. that they reuse. rubber is typically porous. could it be properly sanitized for the next guest? the chef creates the dessert presentation himself which is cool  except he is so inside his own head he does not smile, say thank you, or do anything at all besides announce the components. way to bring the whole experience down. the guy that filled my water was friendlier. ps  no tap water only bottled dress code variable. reviews say no jeans but two men were wearing jeans. one guy had sneakers on. fail. basically, you do not go here for a dining experience. you go here to be told how to enjoy the spectacle."
1613,Laura S.,1130,1,11/1/12,food has to be tasty. good presentation and creativity is good but taste comes first. sorry it is not this case.
1614,Rebecca M.,1130,5,8/15/17,"it is intimidating to walk up to the front door of alinea, knowing you are going to be served some of the best and most expensive food of your life, but once i walked inside the experience was amazing. while it definitely is classy and formal inside, it was never too hoity toity and the servers a whole team of them! made us feel very comfortable. every dish was fantastic in terms of inventiveness and presentation. sure, there were some flavors that i did not like, but i could at least appreciate the effort that went into each one. everything about the experience was above and beyond everything i expected. for me, this is one of those onceinalifetime experiences that is definitely worth it."
1615,Tiffany D.,1130,5,4/12/18,"we did it! we finally went and enjoyed the performance at alinea. we did dinner in the gallery and we enjoyed every ounce of the selection that was presented to us. this is truly the most unique dining experience i have ever had in my life and one i will not forget! we are thankful to live in chicago and have access to some of the best culinary restaurants in the world and this is one of them. we have friends from all over the world that know of alinea and their reputation for delivering an exceptional meal, and we will be able to share with them our agreement."
1616,Megan K.,1130,5,7/24/17,"i have wanted to dine at alinea for...ever? finally my time came. my friend got us a table in the salon for my birthday and it was certainly everything i had hoped it would be. i will preface by saying most find me to be picky, in the sense that i am typically very skeptical when it comes to highly rated places. i have been duped far too many times. but alinea is the real deal. we arrived on a rainy friday evening and the hostess pushed back the doors. it was like being led into some culinary fantasy. every detail was meticulously planned and i cannot choose a favorite course. the savory oreo was pure sin, black truffle, pumpernickel, and guyere cheese. the caviar taco was genius. the short rib was so smoky and sweet. and of course dessert was terribly whimsical and fun. our waiter was delightful and the atmosphere was not stuffy in the least. the other couples in the salon were interactive and we had a lot of fun. i will say, if you are not much of a drinker, you will be drunk when you leave based on the wine pairing. they are definitely generous. i also felt that there could have been a bit more time between courses but i understand they want to accommodate as many patrons as they can. overall, it was wonderful!"
1617,Jenna R.,1130,5,8/11/17,took my husband for his birthday here in . it was spectacular. you are not just buying a meal but an experience. everything had a smooth transition into the next plate. food was high quality. one of my favorite parts was the green apple flavored balloon that was filled with helium. definitely made our meal lighthearted and fun! the chef knows what he is doing and we are planning to go again due to their new menu.
1618,Raul C.,1130,5,8/8/18,"in this place the experience comes before the food. from the moment you walk in. as you enter the door, you feel like you are going through a passage into another realm. the staff has a unique personality. i will not reiterate the obvious quality creations of chef and his team. you have to try this!."
1619,J L.,1130,5,3/18/18,"been over  times  never stuffy, always fun, and fills me with a feeling similar to when i was in grade school and was going on a field trip. i hope everyone reading this will enjoy a meal here. it is so special, every time."
1620,Judy M.,1130,5,1/25/18,best dining experience of my life. this is the perfect gift for any foodie that can appreciate different tastes and textures in foods. i loved every second of the experience from the moment we checked into our reservation highly recommend you give alinea a chance so you can understand my obsession and agree with me!
1621,YJ L.,1130,5,8/11/18,"such an intriguing and ambrosial dinning experience! no spoil here, since exploration was one part of the experience.love watching people enjoying the carnival!"
1622,Sarah R.,1130,5,6/22/18,"awesome! delicious! fun! exciting! i am not even close to qualified to be reviewing the food i experienced at alinea but i will give you some thoughts that may help you prepare for an amazing dinner here. so, like i said, my only credibility regarding food is that i love it and eat out a lot. chef achatz certainly does not need my approval with  michelin stars but for what it is worth i was absolutely in love with the flavors, textures, and artistic beauty of the dishes we were served. i mean listen, everything tasted delicious. if you are someone that does not like the food here, you are simply wrong. seriously though, i was a little worried that maybe my palate is not refined enough and i would not like some of the dishes but this definitely did not happen. the flavors were complex but completely approachable and easy to eat. the servers do an excellent job of preparing you for everything as you go. you never have to wonder if you are doing it right. not to say that there were not some things i liked better than others or aspects that could not be evolved but every single dish was thoughtful, creative, and meticulous. you will have an option for wine pairings. unless you have a true need to be exposed to rare and elite wine, you will be perfectly delighted by the bottom tier wine pairing option. we are not wine experts but certainly know what mediocre wine tastes like and you will get really excellent wine if you go with the budget friendly pairing. a place like this does not serve bad wine so do not sweat this decision if you are not a wine expert. just go with what you are willing to pay for. the service, as i said, was just excellent. we felt welcomed and guided delicately throughout the experience. although there is an element of seriousness which is well deserved while dining at a restaurant of this caliber, our servers always inserted playfulness and humor to keep us having fun and putting us at ease to really stay in the moment and fully enjoy each step of the way. i will not go into any details about what we experienced because i think an element of surprise will maximize your own experience so just go! wear something really nice but do not feel like you have to be formal. think of what you would wear to an evening wedding reception in the city. have fun, keep an open mind and know you are in the best hands at alinea! they will take you on a trip of a lifetime."
1623,Isiah T.,1130,5,1/5/18,"i cannot say anything else less than spectacular. everything lived up to its myths, except for the wait staff. they were beyond my expectations. my girlfriend and i visited alinea for her birthday last year. we expected everyone to be very stuffy and very straitlaced. we had a  reservation for july, . even after some careful planning, on my part, we still ended up being  minutes early. we imagined the front desk staff turning us away because of my eagerness. surprisingly, we were not shunned away to wait at a nearby bar. my girlfriend and i were led to our table and pampered immediately. the atmosphere and the decorations was very intimate, but open. when i made the reservations i opted not to purchase the drink package with the ticket. i am glad i did not because the sommelier was very helpful. we are not drink connoisseurs and i am not a big fan of reds. i though we were out of luck, but the sommelier catered to our drink tastes and complemented each course with an appropriate drink. the courses are indescribable. its a you just have to go there kind of thing. my review would not do alinea any justice. everything about this place is memorable, from the staff joking with my girlfriend and i puns galore, the sommelier's helpful guidance that champagne though, the courses that potato. whenever i look at the champagne's cork that we saved i am taken back."
1624,Luffy I.,1130,5,4/9/18,"molecule gastronomy fantasia. this is the singular eye opener event of contemporary food art. we had the salon menu and the  courses were well worth the price.  star michelin halo restaurant, you just cannot go wrong."
1625,Jackie W.,1130,5,1/20/18,chef grant achatz is a culinary wizard. it is no wonder that alinea is # of the world's best restaurant and has  michelin stars. this is definitely the most impressive and interactive culinary experience. we would definitely come back!!!!! not only the food is fantastic but the presentation just blew our mind.
1626,Terry C.,1130,5,8/8/18,"worth the hype. while certainly not affordable for everyone, for us it was worth saving up for. laid back, not pretentious, and really a thoughtful and different take on food and cooking as a whole."
1627,Jung Ha L.,1130,5,6/20/18,"there is nothing that i can say about alinea that has not been said before. obviously not your typical restaurant, and i do not think anyone has ever said gee, i am feeling peckish and i have a hankering for alinea, but you are truly in for a dining experience of a lifetime."
1628,Marilyn S.,1130,5,2/15/18,"alinea is a circus for the senses!!! site, smell, touch and omg taste. like nothing i have ever experienced before. my favorite part was the trip to the kitchen when i was able to see the magic in the making. the food was a work of art and an explosion of flavors. ask about the wine pairing... it was not offered to us but they have a few options and it is worth the extra  for there expert suggestions."
1629,Amy E.,1130,5,4/26/18,such a fun experience that is hard to describe to others. everything they do plays with your senses whether it be oranges in dried ice or putting out a bowl of fire with branches from a christmas tree. i also cannot leave out their edible balloons. that was the best part! we had purchased the salon and that was enough food to make us full. the portions are about  bites per plate.
1630,Chris R.,1130,5,7/21/18,"i have been curious for quite some time on whether this would live up to its reputation. i have seen the romanticized episodes and segments on various shows, and i think it lives up to the hype. for the first time in my life, i felt transported to another place with the multisensory experience. our dinner was heavily sprinkled with various edible flowers, and some of the wine offerings made for the epitome of what one would want out of a pairing. i would recommend one wine pairing for two people, and then you can always add a glass to the meal if you would like."
1631,Dan W.,1130,5,7/26/18,"best dining experience of my life. everything was awesome, made you think, surprised you, and on top of it all there was impeccable service. we saw mr. achatz in the kitchen plating food as we walked past for one of the courses. great job!"
1632,Alain V.,1130,4,11/19/16,"grant achatz's newly decorated restaurant reminds me of his old decoration. this place is to dining what moma is to art. the visual is more stunning than the dining pleasure. at three michelin, you should expect perfection and this delivers. i prefer next, his second chicago restaurant. that place combines dining pleasure and plating. if you need to get engaged, a must. wait until the dessert which is beyond description. by far superior to grace, the other three stars michelin in chicago. i personally prefer the gordon ramsey experience at the trianon of versailles chocolate, beef and wine. in chicago the best priceviewmichelin is  at trump."
1633,Susana D.,1130,5,1/2/17,"by far my favorite restaurant ever. after visiting alnea, i will have a difficult time finding another place that present you with the most delicious food. my taste. ufa were jumping with joy. cannot wait to come back and try the new menu"
1634,Jillian M.,1130,5,9/26/14,"i was taken here for my birthday a couple weeks ago, and i am so sick of telling everyone about my experience because i have repeated the same thing at least  times, so i will keep this short and sweet.... it was a mind blowing experience that tickled my tastebuds with almost every bite.  courses and the last  were the ones i was least impressed with flavor wise, but presentation wise, no doubt, they delivered. if you get the opportunity to go, do it. it is not something you can experience everyday, nor yearly, and some people will never know the greatness that is alinea in their lifetime. it is a luxury that a lot of people cannot afford and or are too closed mindedcheap to spend the money on. it is food like you have never seen. the service is impeccable and if i am ever rolling in dough, i will be spending it at alinea to taste what new creation grant achatz has come up with. alinea is art in the form of food. go. now."
1635,Angela S.,1130,5,8/24/16,"if you are on the fence about spending the money on alinea, consider this you may not fall in love with every single course out of ish courses you are bound to like some better than others but you will have a unique opportunity to try seasonally fresh and exceptional ingredients paired with an experience to remember. i would advise avoiding too much research or yelp trolling. allow yourself to be surprised and make your own judgments. i can promise the entire experience will be exceptional. i cannot say enough about the service. every staff member remembered and acknowledged the occasion we were celebrating. they were prompt and formal but willing to joke around with us. overall, i am very impressed."
1636,Ally W.,1130,4,7/2/15,"the food here is definitely the most innovative i have ever had, and i have had a lot of molecular gastronomy. there are all kinds of creative dishes using things like fire logs that were a pork belly in disguise and helium to fill an apple balloon. every course was like a show. the food was good, but not so amazing that i continue to crave it  i feel like the meal was more like a performance. the grand finale dessert was an artful masterpiece, but the chef who painted it was kind of cocky. i do have very high expectations for a star michelin restaurant. when i spend  on a meal, it must exceed my expectations, but i actually left feeling a little hungry.  start off like some of the other reviewers, i did not think the mandatory  gratuity was appropriate. service was fine, but more like around . maybe  since the chef seemed like he had more snobbish attitude than the truffles he was serving."
1637,Vivi W.,1130,5,4/14/14,needless the say the food was amazing service was also amazing. it is not one of those snotty five star restaurants where waiters are super stuck up. they took picture and videos for us and made sure we had a good time. chef grant achatz was super nice to us and prepared an extra black truffle dish. finally he invited us to the kitchen where we got to meet the chefs and take photos with him amazing culinary experience and a fun night out
1638,Hannah P.,1130,5,6/23/17,definitely worth going to at least once in your life especially if you are a foodie. every dish was delicious and meticulous made for you. it was really a wonderful experience that i recommend it to everyone. we did not pair with wines because it was super expensive but we enjoyed every moment of it anyways!
1639,John K.,1130,5,8/20/14," birthday ball and being that it was the gf's birthday, the kitchen sent out an additional course in celebration. pro tip if it is indeed a special event, perhaps let the restaurant know in advance. after seeing this dish, other diners proceeded to say it was their special day  not sure if the kitchen could accommodate something they clearly prepare in advance. but moving on to the dish itself, the birthday ball was tempered with dark chocolate and a piece of dehydrated birthday cake, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate cream. our server poured a vanilla creme anglaise tableside to unwrap the present. very cool.  milk chocolate pate sucree, violet, hazelnut and for our final course  modernist art on the dining table. the paint?  tainori milk chocolate, frozen violet sugar, violet sauce, creme fraiche, candied basil, crispy brown butter, frozen milk meringue, and pate sucree. armagnac butterscotch and hazelnut and feuilletine rocks provided some texture and richness as well. with liquid nitrogen, the milk chocolate was used to great effect to create a gelatinous tart that was creamy and light  topped with the candied basil, milk meringue, and crisp brown butter. and with that, our threehour three star experience in chicago came to an end. presented with the additional check for wine for the night, we reflected on one of the best meals of our lives. exemplary service was personable and not stiff. the dishes were a display of both show and technique, but most importantly, exceptional taste. while the creativity was clear, there was a reason behind every ingredient and element to each dish. and while  for a meal is understandably a ridiculous sum for most of us, it is worth it at least once if you have the opportunity. it is a learning experience to be sure  you cannot help but understand food on a new level."
1640,Lynne F.,1130,2,6/5/16,"note i was here for a business dinner, meaning i am reviewing the food and the experience with a minor consideration for the  price tag. i hate to say it, but i really have experienced better. there were at least  dishes i did not finish completely because i just did not like them. had i known what they were, i would have actively selected other dishes. hospitality was great and paying for the meal was discreet they just charged the card i reserved with, which i appreciated in a business setting, but the food was just average, if not worse. the dining experience as a whole was a performance, with food having a minor role. had i come in expecting a performance instead of a meal, this would be  stars for sure. i guess if you are , and this is the first expensive meal you are taking your significant other to, i would suggest going elsewhere. this is good if you have experienced many fine dining restaurants where you can add context as to how this fits in with the greater dining universe."
1641,Caroline S.,1130,5,6/27/17,"our entire meal was exquisite, and the artistry involved in both the crafting and presentation of the gallery experience was phenomenal!"
1642,Kelly N.,1130,5,4/2/14,"alinea is so much more than just a place that happens to serve food  it is an experience. you need to go in expecting to be entertained not just satiated. as mariah c stated it really is willy wonka fabulous with taste eyou did not know were possible and new heights of edible artistry. i was definitely wowed on this dimension alone which earned the five stars. as other reviewers have mentioned, the wine pairing is expensive plan for an additional ~person and i did not find them over the top fabulous but they were really good. i did find the sommelier to be pretentious yet scruffy. he looked like a jolly fellow, but when he presented each wine course he listed off the name of it as if we should obviously know the wine and where is was from and then left quickly. given the level of experience, i would have liked him to read the group, offer a couple brief tasting notes other than the name. if you are not super into wine, i would suggest getting a couple bottles one white, one red that you can enjoy through the meal. regarding the rest of the service, generally the service was very nicely done and executed as if it were a choreographed show."
1643,LovestoEat N.,1130,3,6/17/15,"after reading all the glorious reviews about this place, i had to see it for myself. bought two tickets for dinner, which came out to be about  with service charge and tax. this is not the final price, once you are there wine and tip are additional. so the night of our special dinner finally came and my bf and i were both very excited about trying alinea for the first time. we got to the place and it looked like a warehouse from the outside. we walked down a long dimly lit hallway with no decor, and with some confusion, we reassured each other that this must be the master chef's way of luring you into a surprise. at the end of the hallway, we eventually ended up at the entrance to the restaurant. we were greeted and escorted to our table. eh, not much of a surprise there. we decided not to do wine pairing but ordered wine by the glass. then our evening began. one by one, our  course meal came out. the food was good, but nothing really wowed us. the flavor was too salty for our tastes. we sent some dishes away half eaten, which was a little unexpected to the staff i guess because i heard them asking each other, what happened there? the only memorable thing for me was the dessert presentation at the very end. it was beautifully performed, although i did not eat much of that dessert. we paid over  for our dinner and i did not think it was worth it at all. the staff was very nice and service was great, but it got a little uncomfortable after awhile because the room was very small and there was a guy supervisor? who just stood there and watched everyone. i know his job was to quickly attend to people's needs, but by standing there and watching us eat, it was very uncomfortable. we also were afraid to use our normal voices or talk about certain things because it was very quiet in the room, so anything you say could be heard by the customer next to you or that supervisor. it was a unique dining experience, but definitely not worth the price."
1644,Lori W.,1130,5,12/25/15,"an experience. there were several surprises that made me literally squeal and giggle in delight. the food is topnotch, obviously unique, thoughtful, fresh... everything you would expect from many restaurants of its caliber. but, the thing that set it apart to me is the thought that so clearly goes into your total experience. i just cannot even say more without ruining it! the service is worth note, as well. i expected one of two things either stuffy and pretentious, or hipster and unapproachable. not. even. close. the very young staff is a perfect blend of professional, knowledgeable and helpful they take your jacket, they offer cab service, they know what to do with your napkin when you go to the restroom... everything you expect when you pay this much... but sooooo approachable, downtoearth and... well... cool. they will make you laugh, they love food but do not take themselves too seriously. this is worth every penny if you are into this sort of thing  ."
1645,Alex Z.,1130,5,7/31/16,"let me preface to say that the party i was with we are already huge fans of the alinea group and grant achatz. we were very eager to visit the restaurant, taking advantage of the opportunity where we all were in chicago. we opted for the salon dining option for  people at  pm. we were greeted immediately and brought out to the dining room. i will try to avoid spoilers about the experience because i think that is half the magic that takes place at alinea. surprise, whimsy, and wonder. in terms of the food itself, keeping its prestige and price in mind, i was impressed but not blown away by the food. maybe my expectations were set a bit too high but compared to other three star michellin and worlds  best that i have visited, i would say it was just a tad bit underwhelming. some dishes were absolutely exceptional and will forever be remembered as some of the best plates of food i have ever eaten from a technique and inventive perspective but some dishes lacked the same excellent cohesiveness in concept and execution. however, they reportedly to change their menu every few months so i understand that it is incredibly difficult to uphold consistency at that level while constantly trying to innovate and evolve so i really do not fault them as i do appreciate their willingness to experiment. were my expectations on the food met? maybe not. was it still one of the best meals i have had? most definitely up there. what sets alinea apart is its service and flare. the tricks and surprises on the senses is truly remarkable. this was more theater than fine dining. we were constantly questioning the reason for everything they presented to us knowing that it would result in something either magical and surprising that would serve the compliment the food in a multisensory experience. without giving anything away, i would just recommend to let yourself be immersed in the world they create and remember to see, smell, hear and touch in addition to taste for the full experience. with that said, i could not recommend alinea more of you have the means to do so. it comes with a hefty bill but it was definitely more than just a dinner. it was an experience we will all remember forever and an example of a restaurant that pushes its boundaries to create a meal about more than just tasting the food. ps we fan girl would afterwards and got a pic with grant. so as an aspiring chef there was no better way to cap off the night than meeting the master himself."
1646,Karl H.,1130,5,6/5/17,"achatz and bagale have created a masterpiece. twice. alinea's kitchen table experience is not just food it is visual art, it is theater, it is music. it is mozart, it is miles davis, it is rock 'n' fking roll. a group of us celebrated a variety of milestones at the kitchen table, which has an unbelievable view of obviously the kitchen. the food is magnificent, but i will not preview the experience by telling you what they will serve or how they will serve it. alinea is more suspenseful and full of misdirection than a christopher nolan film, so it would be a crime to spoil it. everyone who took part in the production was kind and welcoming. our main server and sommelier were delightful. chef bagale was generous with his time. i will be thinking about this meal for years."
1647,Edward F.,1130,5,9/19/15,"it was the most creative meal i ever had. the experience, environment and food are unique and exquisite. absolutely superb from the starting cocktail to the edible helium balloons. it was entertaining as well as enjoyable. definitely order the wine paring."
1648,Kelly J.,1130,5,11/13/13,"everything about alinea is revolutionary. this is without question my ultimate foodie experience. everything here is executed to absolute perfection and the attention to detail is like little else i have seen. the whole evening is so innovative, unique and filled with such excitement about what is being placed in front of you. it is just a dream come true to come here. to say the food is excellent just seems like the understatement of the century. this is also theater at its best and it stimulates and overwhelms all your senses at once and in the best way imaginable. i believe i was positively giddy with joy the whole time! i was so enraptured with the food, that i had to remind myself to drink the wine everything was exquisitely paired with. impossible to pick a favorite course out of the  offered, however i was partial to the hot potato, the black truffle explosion and the duck. the only thing i would alter would be less dessert courses. i am more a savory lover than sweet. that said, the dessert was as delicious as it was beautifully entertaining to have one of the chefs come out and paint chocolate all over our table. what a performance! service was flawless and everyone exudes an air of gracious professionalism while never being stuffy in the slightest. the feeling strongly shines through that this cohesive team of people love what they are bringing to diners.. a truly magnificent experience and something i am grateful i am able to do. if you have the means and are into molecular gastronomy this is a must do. grant achatz is nothing short of a genius. soundcloud.comthefeedpoÄ"
1649,Kaiqing Y.,1130,5,6/9/17,"every course was a punch, surprise, interesting, beautiful, and delicious. lots of asian elements, i.e. thai, china, japan. it worth to plan a trip to chicago. suggestion to the management you may want to consider increasing the light strength a little bit, and use some high frequency lighting sources. there is strong flicker effect dark horizontal lines for my camera. it also shows in other yelper's post"
1650,Andrea G.,1130,4,12/8/15,"for what it is worth alinea does exactly what you think it amazes .. the food was not phenomenal but the presentation and the experience was . to be able to go and enjoy a dinner of such is a blessing . if you can afford to go without starving for the month then go for it , if your going to eat a good meal then do not do it . i would not do it again but i definitely cherished the moment when i was there . the only really memorable and tasty dish was the balloon which is made out of taffy and you have to inhale to eat. it gets a little messy but they bring you hot towels to clean up."
1651,,1122,4,11/1/18,"my mother and i came here last sunday. the environment and the service were good. my mother and i shared a calamari as our appetizer, the calamari was ok. my mother got a  oz. filet mignon with baked potato and i got a salmon with baked potato. the steak and the salmon was so so. not delicious at all. both my mother and i do not like it. we had a new york cheesecake as our dessert, and i like the dessert. it was good. my drink was also good."
1652,,1122,5,8/4/18,"my absolute favorite steakhouse in seattle  they have both turf and surf, but if you are going to the met, start with one of their fabulous appetizers such as the teriyaki bites oh, and come with an empty stomach, an appetizer can easily feed two or three people.  then move on to the entree - i love their filet mignon and prime rib.  they serve their meals with a baked potato the size of an appetizer plate and will load it up depending up on your liking right at the table  the meat melts in your mouth and the fat content is just right.  enough to make if flavorful, but still lean  the creme brulee for desert is also divine  my daughter loves the  layer chocolate cake also, but i do not know how she eats it all its huge. another plus is that usually once a year, some of the seahawks come and play waiter for the night. throughout the years we have attended, we met doug baldwin, cliff avril, big red bryant, kj wright and many more they take pictures with the guests and doug even sat and chatted with us  it was an excellent way to get to know the players and have a fantastic meal"
1653,,1122,5,6/15/18,"wow very nice we came here for a celebration for a party of . we arrived early but were seated immediately. our server was super nice and always checking in on us. we ordered crab cake, calamari and lobster mac and cheese for appetizers. i think our favorite was the crab cake, although i kind of wish it was cut into smaller pieces to share. it came in  patties and we tried to cut it ourselves and kind of made a mess. i ordered a  oz filet mignon with mash potatoes. ok heres the thing, one do not underestimate the size of the meat my eyes were bigger than my stomach so i ordered  oz and i barely ate  of the steak which was really sad for me. two, probably do not order an appetizer if your stomach is small like mine. after the appetizer i was pretty much full and did not have enough room for my steak which was the star of my meal. aside for my personal complaints about not having enough stomach size, everything was so good i got a medium filet mignon and it was very well cooked, pink all the way through and all the juice is retained making it juicy and tender. very creamy mash potato, must have of had a lot of butter in it. we also ordered the banana flambe and the bananator put on a mini show for us. to put the cherry on top we saw the ceo of t-mobile dining at the same time definitely made me feel like a celebrity or something."
1654,,1122,4,5/24/18,"i've been to the met twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner.  it was very, very good. between the two times i've been there i've tried the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers, dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes, prime teriyaki tenderloin bites, blackened prime rib, and filet mignon . both the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers and prime teriyaki tenderloin bites were incredibly good, very tender, and packed full of flavor.  the bacon was crispy and fatty and added really nice flavor to the steak.  it was borderline too much of a good thing, but i'm not complaining.  the teriyaki sauce on medallions had a nice sweet and saltiness - teriyakisteak is one of my favorite meat combos and this is up there with the best of that pairing i've had. the crab cakes are really good. you get a lot of grab and a nice mix of large chunks of crab and thinner pieces.  there is good moisture on the inside and a nice crispiness on the outside.  it is really good by itself, with a little lemon or the slaw and sweet sauce.  definitely check out if you like crab cakes. the filet mignon was unnecessarily tender - in a great way - i feel like you could cut through it with a butter knife.  it was a perfect medium rare, had a good charcrust - great seasoning.  it was probably the best filet that i've tried.  really good. the blackened prime rib - not my favorite.  the meat was very tender, it was cooked perfectly, but i found the seasoning to be just too overpowering.  the salt content on the rub was a little too much for what i like - and i usually season my steaks very well.  the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, bu tender but the crust kept me from loving it.  good flavor, just too much of it and a little too heavy-handed with the salt.  i probably would not order this specific style of prime rib again. beyond the food - the service was great.  the servers are really friendly.  the bar staff has some pretty good stories.  what is really cool about the met is it is history.  while daniel's has a great view of south lake union which i love, when you walk into the met you  immediately feel like you have teleported to an old-school steakhouse because you have and  you see the rich history on the walls with all the celebrities who have eaten there.  daniel's has something similar, but it is not nearly as expansive as the met.  food aside, it is awesome experience to eat there because of the history alone. if you have the money, want to spend it and want steak - go here.  i feel like it is at the top of the pyramid for just-try steakhouses in seattle.  it is the perfect combination of great food and rich history."
1655,,1122,5,4/6/18,"this place was amazing we had crab cakes, calamari to start. i had a wonderfully filet mignon with an oz lobster tail and mashed potatoes. we share asparagus and brussel sprouts with bacon. ended with a raspberry sorbet. was a fabulous dinner and great service."
1656,,1122,4,3/5/18,"this was our first time venturing into the metropolitan grill for our sons th birthday dinner. service was good and the meal even better we ordered a tasty bottle of a spanish wine that was on the sommeliers suggestion list and it definitely paired well with our meal. i thought it was a little strange that our sommelier did not decant our bottle of wine since everyone else had theirs decanted. it was also weird how the floor manager guy in black jacket spoke to every table within our vicinity but not ours i mean for a ticket that was over  we could have used a lot bit of love and schmoozing but hey maybe we just were not black jacket dude worthy. but let us get to the food . it was fabulous i ordered the oz filet mignon medium well and it was delicious, my so who has a lot of food allergies ordered the porterhouse with veggies and our server was very attentive to his restrictions list and accommodating. our son ordered the  day aged sirloin chicago cut medium rare with the oscar added on and it was divine and for our little girl she ordered the cheeseburger for which she gave a double thumbs up. for dessert the birthday man got a creme brulee on the house, and i ordered the  layer chocolate cake i was so excited with dinner i totally forgot pics, sorry, it is a huge slice of cake with a side of vanilla bean ice cream and very decadent. overall, the food was great, our server was attentive, and it is as pricey as you would expect. only thing that i found slightly weird was the dated decor and the mirrors on the wall across from our booth, it made it feel like you were up in the business of the patrons seated directly across from you which did not help that they were grown folks trying to get jiggy with it in their booth not thinking that their friskiness was not being reflected into the mirror and was not up in our faces.but hey--maybe the steaks and wine has that effect on people. lol."
1657,,1122,4,2/17/18,"this place is more down to earth and workmanlike than el gaucho or john howie it is a bit louder, brighter, and more casual--but the prices are just as steep. the steaks--the whole point really--are best at el gaucho, we think we are two adults and a  year old. we had the filet mignon at each establishment. the met's came in nd. we have less agreement on whose sides are best. here, we had the onion rings, which were amazing light and crispy breading, perfectly adhered to large cut onion rings, and perfectly fried. the warm complimentary bread was a delectable sourdough potato bread. wife and i got the roasted roots carrots, squash, etc. with our steaks, because she wanted to try the potato cakes also. both were great, though the cakes are really just a pile of hash browns. kid got the garlic mashed potatoes, and they were very garlicky. so, it was nice. but we all agree that we would go back to el gaucho first."
1658,,1122,5,2/12/18,"let me preface by saying my fiance and i come here almost every other month - needless to say, this is our favorite steakhouse and the food never disappoints. ever. expect to drop a few pretty pennies. for starters, i would recommend their baby spinach salad if you are not into heavy appetizers. the combination of crispy bacon bits & fresh mozzarella is pretty amazing. crab cakes. good but nothing to write home about. definitely order the calamari though, it is got a nice little  kick to it with all the cherry peppers. the steaks. the steaks are amazing. i've tried their peppercorn, ribeye, filet mignon , porterhouse, new york. but my favorite is their blackened prime rib, medium rare. bone-in ribeye is also great tip you can request it blackened, which i recommend. i always get my steak with brussels sprouts and my fiance gets his with creamed spinach - we do not care for mashed potatoes or roasted veggies. and yes, you can ask to substitute. for the table, we always order the lobster mac & cheese - crispy yet tender with tons of lobster chunks. you do not need any sauce with your steak because it is so flavorful, but i need horseradish with mine. ask for both fresh and creamy horseradish. you can expect top-notch service from everyone working at the met - from valet to hostess to the servers. the servers are super friendly, not to mention knowledgeable, and very attentive."
1659,,1122,5,2/8/18,"visited the metropolitan grill for dinner on our first night out in seattle. we called around pm to make a reservation for around pm, but the nice lady we spoke to on the phone told us she could not accommodate us with a reservation because they were all booked throughout the night. nonetheless she informed us about the bar side and told us they have there full dinner menu as well. upon arrival we got our coats & umbrella tooken  care of and they were hung away for us inside a coat room. unfortunately there was no tables available at the bar side, but our host made sure she would sit us down in no time. we waited nearly - minutes to be seated. our server jennifer promptly introduced herself to us and offered us some drink choices . we opted for . a lemon drop martini . met manhattan . martini bombay sapphire . another martini i cannot recall the name .a local brewed tap beer i cannot recall the name of. for appetizers we opted for . fresh onion soup . clam chowder soup . classic ceaser salad these both soups are a must try they were supper delicious for our entrees we chose . american wagyu . filet mignon . blackened prime rib . alaskan lobster tail medium in size for dessert . chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream it was our servers treat since she told us the childcare was very rich in flavor. . home made ny cheesecake. felt like royalty service. & every single bite was to die for. cannot wait to dine here on another trip. it was worth every penny. +"
1660,,1122,5,1/17/18,"people rave about this seattle classic - supposedly is a must try place and they were right. classic restaurant - old school steakhouse. velvet green booths. waiter ins white coats - amazing service i would come back on the service alone. they were so accommodating and helpful. i never went dry on water - i am a sucker for constant water refills lol - got the kettle one mule, it was delicious i actually had  started my night with the french onion soup. to die for cheesy and gooey goodness. must try to we had the metropolitan prawn cocktail huge and the kobe meatballs over garlic cheesy polenta so good. for my main course i got the oz filet mignon oz wagyu medium well with mash potatoes. it cooked to perfection and i killed it. to share we had lobster mac and cheese, brussels sprouts and mushroom. all delicious last but not least we had the bananas fosters it was dinner and a show, they cooked it right at the table. worth the show and taste divine. loved this place would gladly come again."
1661,,1122,2,11/26/17,"honestly, the met has been my favorite steakhouse for the past  years i went back today with my friends and we were all disappointed. it is just not as good as before anymore  we ordered - a dozen of oysters - calamari  - crab cake  - lobster mac & cheese  - clam chowder - caesar salad - filet mignon medium rare - top cap sirloin medium rare - boneless ribeye medium rare this is my order - new york strip medium rare - banana foster  too slow we waited for  minutes for our entree  im not talking about the old superpacked, - hour wait dinner night. i'm talking about a night with only about % tables occupied. it is not a full house night where all the seats were seated.  calamari they downsized the portion and it was not as flavorful as before  crab cakes the taste was alright but the texture was disappointing. the crab cakes were not holding on to each other.  lobster mac & cheese this was one disappointing dish  we could not taste the lobster in it probably because there were barely any lobster pieces in the dish.  overcooked boneless ribeye my ribeye was overcooked and it does not look like a ribeye  they had to make me a new one.  banana foster just as good as i remembered it was so good the sweetness of the banana plus cinnamon plus rum equals to perfecto. it is something you cannot go wrong i am not sure if i will be returning to metropolitan grill just yet. there are so many other restaurants i would like to try in seattle until next time"
1662,,1122,4,11/19/17,". rounding up anniversary dinners are great occasions for significantly increasing the food spending limit, to try what is never been tasted. valet parking was a little confused with where to take the car for valet parking, but it really is to drive up to the front of the restaurant. do not try parking in the biking lane, which is closest to the restaurant, but to the one next to it. did i semi-worry about getting rear ended, as i hesitantly parked in the next lane yes, i did. but not to worry. the valets are on the lookout and will make their way to you. as you see them disappear with your car, you will get a claim ticket, which you will need to show your waiter at the end of the meal and valet is not complimentary - expect a little over  charge on the your receipt. ambiance had a reservation, a few weeks in advance, and were surprised to be seated so slowly. the front was not as receiving as they could be, and i was a bit put-off by that, but when we were finally seated, our seats were nice. it is definitely a nice place, for a slightly old school romantic feeling, or just to entertain out of town guests to a pricier dinner. our waiter was very cheerful and in a friendly way explained what went into our meal. he gave us a lot of space to you know, take in the romantic atmosphere, and made sure our water glasses were filled. food let us break it down. complimentary bread came out warm with a scoop of butter. the bread was sour, but the texture was wonderful. soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. good starter for the following. raw oysters -  oysters  were shigoku and i do not remember the other . but all were delicious were brought out with a side of their house cocktail sauce and a champagne mignonette. i liked the oysters as they were with a little squeeze of lemon love that fresh oyster taste, but adding a little bit of the champagne mignonette was pretty good. the mignonette complemented the oysters very well by providing a smidgen of acidity. i would not recommend using the house sauce, unless you want to mask some of the oyster taste. but the house sauce was not bad. it just did not complement as well as the champagne mignonette. brussels sprouts with kurobuta bacon - not crispy and pretty bland. there were some pieces that were okay, but overall, it was not worth getting. after the first bite of soft sprouts, i made a move towards the salt shaker it just did not get any lovin' from the bacon and there was no drizzle of sauce to explode with flavor. i have definitely had much better brussels sprouts at restaurants like aqua el gaucho] and ruth's. wagyu] snow beef with mashed potatoes] - i've never been able to say that beef tastes sweet until i tried this. it had an incredibly soft texture and was effortless to chew. it did not melt away as i cut into it, but it melted in my mouth. each bite was slow and with purpose i savored that little thing. i could tell that it came from a cow whose life was privileged. would i get it again the experience was not something i need to relive and the price was hefty for a taste of exclusivity, so no. but, the side of mashed potatoes were oh-so-delicious they were, clearly, freshly mashed and perfectly savory. right amount of everything. absolutely perfect with the beef. the roasted vegetables were also incredibly good. they were sweet and soft - also very good complements with the beef. american wagyu] filet mignon - i actually enjoyed the taste of this one more than the snow beef. it is also very soft, but with a more savory and meatier taste. he had a side of asparagus with it. the asparagus was okay, but nothing special. i would say to just go with the mashed potatoes. for dessert, we were eyeing the white chocolate coconut cake when our waiter arrived with a candle lit burnt cream. i did consider, for a second, to still order the cake, but rationality settled and i kept myself from doing so. the creme brulee was still very good. runnier than i would like, but with a nice torched layer of candy-like crust on top. had to give it a good tap to break the top. as a complimentary dessert, it was a satisfyingly delicious way to end the night. to close all of what i've just written. the total came out to be around  including valet and tip. justifiable hm. honestly, i would not consider it the best of our choices, but it was good for our one night. we had a lovely time."
1663,,1122,5,8/14/17,"after a two month renovation, they opened again tonight and were right back on target the panko and almond crusted scallops were great the french onion soup was fantastic the mashed potatoes and filet mignon were so good, i could not even finish. i have some leftovers for tomorrow"
1664,,1122,5,5/28/17,"we walked in and were greeted by three employees. all very nice. our waiter walked us to our table and walked us through their menu and explained the desserts. another server came around at the perfect moments to fill our water cups. the restaurant is upscale - very nice. the food was delicious. i had the filet mignon with a side of melt in your mouth mashed potatoes. my filet mignon was medium well and it came with a side of aus jus that enhanced it big league or bigly  my fiance had the grilled salmon with a side of mashed potatoes. the salmon was huge and very well done. melt in your mouth deliciousness we ended our meal with a hard breaking decision of a dessert. we did not know what we wanted between the strawberry shortcake or the  layer cake. my girl decided to go the chocolate route so we got the  layer chocolate cake. great decision as it was amazing. it came with a side of locally made vanilla ice cream which is the best vanilla ice cream i've ever had. the cake was rich, smooth and very, very tasty. my fiance reminded me that it was our  year  month anniversary so i jokingly told her that the reason we came to the mg is to celebrate. do yourself a favor and bookmark this place so you come when you are in town."
1665,,1122,5,5/26/17,"wow just wow this review is for when i was in seattle during july, went in on the th so there was no traffic and parking was simple and easy.  we had originally wanted to go to tilth but, they were closed for the fourth of july unfortunately. but oh man am i glad that they were closed, otherwise i would not have had the chance to eat at this glorious establishment.  place is very nice and fancy, very upscale steakhouse.  we had started with the steak tartare which was phenomenal, best steak tartare i have ever had in my life, everything about about it was just great  i had also ordered the french onion soup which was maybe not the best but still very good.  and then on to the main course which was the ohmi filet mignon , this was the most tender, buttery, and juiciest filet mignon i have ever had.  worth every damn penny.  suffice to say it was not a cheap meal.  had the usual baked potato as a side which is a must for me whenever i eat steak.  on to the service which was efficient, kind, helpful and quite speedy.  our waiter was like a psychic ninja.  had a great time here and am looking forward to another visit the next time i am in seattle."
1666,,1122,4,5/16/17,"i've been here two times, once on a date and another this past weekend where i took my family out to dinner for mother's day. both times have been decent experiences where the service was great but the steaks themselves felt generic. since i went with  people this past weekend i was able to practically try their entire menu. from the top of my head we had for apps the seafood platter, calamari, crab cakes, lobster bisque. for entrees we had the filet mignon , the  day dry aged cap, ribeye, rack of lamb, dungeness crab fettuccini, chicken, and wagyu. for dessert we tried he cheesecake and banana foster. the steaks were hit or miss, everything that was not the filet mignon's felt a little tough and dry. considering i spent over  i expected the best steaks in town to be the best steaks in town. the chicken was overcooked and very dry but after we brought it up to our waitress she comped the chicken and gave us a free entree which my uncle decided to get the oz wagyu oz prime which was about  so that really made the service stand out. i loved how well she handled the situation and the mini history lesson with the banana foster guy was nice as well told us about how el gaucho was really el sloucho.lol. food was  and service was , would i go here again probably not unless it was free. but definitely worth trying at least once considering it is an iconic steakhouse in seattle"
1667,,1122,5,5/11/17,i had a filet mignon . it was cooked well. very tasty. the service was good and everyone was super polite and professional. i recommend this place. it is can be pricey.
1668,,1122,5,4/26/17,"went for a special birthday celebration. the place was bustling and had tons of history and character. staff were friendly and really efficient even though it was pretty busy. we got the filet mignon , the walnut salad and some cocktails. everything was delicious and i cannot remember having a filet this good. price was very good for that type of venue and this quality of food."
1669,,1122,5,3/26/17,"i had the filet mignon and it was the absolute best i've ever had. definitely worth the price the atmosphere is nice, not too casual but not too stuffy. and i would recommend making a reservation since it is a pretty popular spot with good reason also the waiter had the best personality and was very attentive."
1670,,1122,5,5/21/14,the met was arguably the best filet mignon meal i've had.  excellent potatoes and vegetables as well.  great dessert menu.  excellent service.  not a stuffy environment at all and has old money look to it.  lot of great pics of celebrities who have dined there.  if back in seattle would definitely go out of my way to dine again
1671,,1122,5,8/5/18,"great dinner  we started with lobster bisque, which was awesome.   split a green fields salad.  linda did alaskan king crab which she loved.  i went with skirt steak and a lobster tail.  talk about gluttony  our server, roger, was awesome  definitely recommend"
1672,,1122,4,5/24/18,"i've been to the met twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner.  it was very, very good. between the two times i've been there i've tried the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers, dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes , prime teriyaki tenderloin bites, blackened prime rib, and filet mignon. both the bacon-wrapped tenderloin skewers and prime teriyaki tenderloin bites were incredibly good, very tender, and packed full of flavor.  the bacon was crispy and fatty and added really nice flavor to the steak.  it was borderline too much of a good thing, but i'm not complaining.  the teriyaki sauce on medallions had a nice sweet and saltiness - teriyakisteak is one of my favorite meat combos and this is up there with the best of that pairing i've had. the crab cakes are really good. you get a lot of grab and a nice mix of large chunks of crab and thinner pieces.  there is good moisture on the inside and a nice crispiness on the outside.  it is really good by itself, with a little lemon or the slaw and sweet sauce.  definitely check out if you like crab cakes . the filet mignon was unnecessarily tender - in a great way - i feel like you could cut through it with a butter knife.  it was a perfect medium rare, had a good charcrust - great seasoning.  it was probably the best filet that i've tried.  really good. the blackened prime rib - not my favorite.  the meat was very tender, it was cooked perfectly, but i found the seasoning to be just too overpowering.  the salt content on the rub was a little too much for what i like - and i usually season my steaks very well.  the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, bu tender but the crust kept me from loving it.  good flavor, just too much of it and a little too heavy-handed with the salt.  i probably would not order this specific style of prime rib again. beyond the food - the service was great.  the servers are really friendly.  the bar staff has some pretty good stories.  what is really cool about the met is it is history.  while daniel's has a great view of south lake union which i love, when you walk into the met you  immediately feel like you have teleported to an old-school steakhouse because you have and  you see the rich history on the walls with all the celebrities who have eaten there.  daniel's has something similar, but it is not nearly as expansive as the met.  food aside, it is awesome experience to eat there because of the history alone. if you have the money, want to spend it and want steak - go here.  i feel like it is at the top of the pyramid for just-try steakhouses in seattle.  it is the perfect combination of great food and rich history."
1673,,1122,5,11/26/17,"my parents were in town and wanted a nice meal. i tried a smaller restaurant i love that is now under new owners. as soon as we sat down it was a negative experience. i called the met from the table and they had room to take us. we paid for our drinks and left for the met. wonderful experience here from our waiter nick to the food and drinks. my parents loved it and were happy, full, relaxed and a little tipsy. lesson learned, not worth skimping. i've always had great food and service here and it is worth the price. i will return here on any special occasion for sure. we had lobster, a filet and alaskan king crab . everything was cooked perfectly, amazingly delicious and just what we all wanted. we topped it off with the chocolate lava cake and wow. so good. thank you for a great evening."
1674,,1122,5,2/13/17,"ambience  i appreciated the old-fashioned style this restaurant had, which honors its history. absolutely, classy and intimate. this spot is perfect for a fancy date night or celebrating an anniversary food  we ordered- the raw oysters on the half she will & dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes to start. was not disappointed, ate every bite and would recommend as well as reorder both for our entrees, i ordered the prime rib and my husband ordered the top sirloin. both steaks were cooked perfectly to our liking to end our meal we ordered the bananas foster which is cooked table side. make sure that you save room for dessert if you are a fan of bananas and caramel, this is the best way to end your meal. trust me, it will make your belly happy service  great service from beginning to the end. starting with the valet employees and ending with our friendly and kind waiter, along with the table side chef. overall  for me, metropolitan grill displayed everything that i look for in my dining experience pleasant ambience, great food, with even better service. i would highly recommend this restaurant"
1675,,1122,4,10/20/14,"in seattle, my best friend and i dined at metropolitan grill in downtown. we ordered a lot of food and just shared everything. the dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes were large and full of sweet crab meat. it was served with a pear-jicama slaw, & sweet chili beurre blanc. the maine lobster bisque had a rich lobster stock, with a touch of heavy cream & cognac. the main course was our prime porterhouse. thhe  ounce steak was tender, well seasoned and grilled to perfection. on the side we added alaskan king crab legs, and let me tell you, this was the best part of my meal. i have never tasted crab legs so succulent & sweet as the ones from metropolitan grill. as side dishes, we had asparagus with bearnaise sauce, yukon gold potato cakes with creme fraiche, and lobster macaroni & cheese. the asparagus was good, but i would not order the potato cake & lobster mac & cheese again. the mac & cheese lacked lobster flavor in the base sauce."
1676,,1122,1,4/2/14,"rude waitress ranting alert- sue g.- you really left my date and i with a bad after taste with our dining experience. customer service can really make it or break it for any establishment, and sue g. ruined it for us. it is a tuesday april fools day and my boyfriend thought it would be sweet to take me out for great steak. we are both carnivores and love red meat, so of course we go to our favorite steak place-the metropolitan grill. the host at the door greeted us by opening the door, i was offered to get my coat checked in, and then we were seated in less than a minute. so far, so good our host that walked us to our table was great. he and my boyfriend shared small talk about the seahawks hoodie he had on. nice guy, very personable. it was not until sue became our waitress that things started going down hill at an exceptional speed. she introduced herself to us, but was not looking at us. she asked us if we would like anything other than water and my bf ordered a pepsi. she returns with pepsi but no water and leaves for a few minutes and returns with my water. ok not so bad just yet, she just was not as awesome as i was hoping but i'm there to eat amazing food so no big deal. she leaves for  minutes without asking us about appetizers or even dropping off any bread, still. no big deal. sue than returns and says, oh- have you been here before sue, that would have been a great question for us when you introduced yourself  minutes ago i reply, its been about a year. she gives us a brief run through, still not looking at us and leaves for  minutes still not suggesting if we wanted to start off with anything. i questioned my bf if she was quite all there. sue is back to take our order. we order the dunegeness and alaskan king crab cakes + prime new york  oz. peppercorn steak with the yukon potato cakes + prime  oz filet mignon with steak fries. i also request for a side of classic bearnaise sauce and i was not ready for the expression that sue gave me- she was flabbergasted, almost to the point of disgusted and says,  .uh, with peppercorn.uh okkkkk. i kid you not. my bf and i just look at each other in disbelief, did that lady just rudely judge me over some bearnaise sauce it was so completely rude and unprofessional if i'm paying + for two, i can drink my classic bearnaise and it should not be any of her concern on how i use it. she could have nicely recommended something else instead of looking at me like i was a idiot. hey, i love bearnaise sauce and i should not have to be ashamed. she leaves, finally returns with bread in hand. i was just so livid with her professionalism that i wanted to request for a new waitress, but i did not want to make a scene so we dealt with sue. got our food boxed up by another server. gave sue my discover card and asked if they accepted discover and she saysuh i do not see why not. lady-you are so unprofessional and down right rude. i apologize if you might have had a long day but i just want to eat in a non judgmental restaurant after my long day. amazing food, do not get me wrong. it was just sue g. that was horrible."
1677,,1122,4,10/18/12,"had another great dinner at the met. the wine steward was knowledgeable and helpful, and the willamette valley pinot was even better. our appetizers were the dungeness & alaskan king crab cakes - delicious and the metropolitan prawn martini - the prawns were huge. my prime filet mignon was perfectly cooked and also delicious. our server was great, not intrusive and very good timing. my only regret is that i did not have room for dessert"
1678,,1122,5,1/26/12,"gee where do i begin with the met. this a great place to come for a damn good steak. i guess you could call it a high end steak house since you are paying over  for a juicy, tender and amazing piece of meat. i have been here a couple times and my favorite is the  oz. filet mignon by far, which cost . yes i said . probably some of the best money i have ever spent on a steak. the filet mignon was a thick cut piece of meat that melted in my mouth and the steak knife cut through it like butter. plus you get a delicious stack of mashed potatoes. yummy the bar also makes very strong long island iced teas whcih my mixed drink of choice. the second time i was here i decided to go all out and get the most amazing dungeness and alaskan king crab cakes , that cost , for the appetizer. talk about a food gasm. then i went ahead and got the biggest steak they had on the menu. i ordered the  oz. prime porterhouse steak that cost . it was so damn big to me it felt like something out of man vs. food and man won. lol. i some how gathered enough strength to finish this masterpiece of a steak along with the crab cakes and the potatoes. let us just say i was suffering form severe food coma after that dinner. it was a pretty epic night for me. that was the biggest steak i have eaten in my life."
1679,,1122,4,9/18/11,"while i'm not a huge steakhouse fan, my husband always picks this place for a nice dinner out. we have been here close to a dozen times now since we moved to seattle, by way of kansas city which is home to some really great steakhouses. one thing that is consistent is the service. always friendly and never stuffy. you can tell good service by how full your water glass stays. i've never seen our glasses get less than  full and for some reason, i never notice when these are actually filled. while the steaks are as good as daniel's or el goucho, and the sides equally delicious, what really sets this place apart is the table side apple pie dessert. the menus says its for two, but it can easily feed  or . if you are not a steak fan, you will be pleased with the non-steak dishes. the alaskan king crab legs are excellent, very fresh tasting, and nice size portions."
1680,,1122,5,9/3/09,"we went here for my boyfriends birthday. the place inside is like an oldies restaurant, and i loved it my boyfriend had steak since that is what they are known for, i cannot remember now which one he had, but let me tell you it was good. very good, and cut to perfection with a side of brocoli, the plate was so big, he could barely finish it. i ordered the alaskan king crab which i am happy i did. they were huge and so delish i had a side of potatoes and we were stuffed. of course we had to get desert, it was my bf bday. so we ordered the  layer chocolate cake with vanilla icecream, all which again delish the cake was huge with this tiny candle on top the service was great, the drink was good. the prices are high, but it is one of those places you just have to try."
1681,,1122,4,11/5/18,"the best traditional steak house in seattle. i use that word because of the familiar menu offerings, old-school decor and vibe, and uniformed waitstaff. for steak overall i still prefer bateau, but this is a great spot. i sampled the crab cakes, prime rib , and brussel sprouts. the crab cakes were phenomenal and had  different types of crab inside. the prime rib was good, but was surprisingly overshadowed by the roasted root vegetable sides sweet potato, carrot, parsnip that came with it. i was underwhelmed by the brussels after failing to convince my dining companion to get the creamed spinach. the desserts looked delicious, but massive. we saw a slice of the carrot cake that looked like a day's worth of food. may return just to try the cake."
1682,,1122,2,10/28/18,"had dinner there  with my daughter.  we both had the french onion soup, she had calimari while i had the prime rib , scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach.  to end, she had the carrot cake and i had the  layer chocolate cake. what a disappointment.  the best part of the dinner was the onion soup.  the calimari was slightly greasy, but the biggest problem was how salty the prime rib and scalloped potatoes were.  had to use excessive horseradish to counteract.  even the end of the meal was disappointing.  carror cake was moist, but  layer chocolate cake was like eating sand.  do not think i have ever tasted a drier desert.  all this for over .  money not well spent."
1683,,1122,5,9/12/18,"if you are in the neighborhood during the day you might want to try their lunch specials.  i'm there every monday for teriyaki london broil.  it is exquisite, tuesday's special is roast pork, wednesday's is meat loaf, thursday's is beef stroganoff and friday's is prime rib . if you can wait until one it would be better."
1684,,1122,5,8/29/18,"incredibly expensive, and worth it. the steak & prime rib melts in your mouth. the potatoes were divine. the service was excellent always there when you needed them. we got the cheap cheap being a relative word here standard steaks. next time i might try the expensive ones to see what those taste like."
1685,,1122,5,8/4/18,"my absolute favorite steakhouse in seattle  they have both turf and surf, but if you are going to the met, start with one of their fabulous appetizers such as the teriyaki bites oh, and come with an empty stomach, an appetizer can easily feed two or three people.  then move on to the entree - i love their filet mignon and prime rib .  they serve their meals with a baked potato the size of an appetizer plate and will load it up depending up on your liking right at the table  the meat melts in your mouth and the fat content is just right.  enough to make if flavorful, but still lean  the creme brulee for desert is also divine  my daughter loves the  layer chocolate cake also, but i do not know how she eats it all its huge. another plus is that usually once a year, some of the seahawks come and play waiter for the night. throughout the years we have attended, we met doug baldwin, cliff avril, big red bryant, kj wright and many more they take pictures with the guests and doug even sat and chatted with us  it was an excellent way to get to know the players and have a fantastic meal"

1687,,1122,3,5/15/18,"be careful, the bread and butter is really delicious. you might find yourself filling up with that before your food even arrives split buffalo wings, a burger and a prime rib switched the potatoes out for a salad. the wings were big and had a nice crisp to it but it needed more sauce. the burger was just mediocre but i did enjoy the potato wedges. the prime rib was a nice thick cut that was on par with the rest of the meal not special. the best item was actually the salad that came with the steak. we sat at the bar but still had excellent service from several different staff members."
1688,,1122,5,4/7/18,"easily one of my all time favorite restaurants. service is always outstanding and the attention to detail is unsurpassed. still my favorite prime rib in seattle and the spinach salad is outstanding too. if you still have room for desert, their bananas foster prepared table side is the perfect end to a great meal. wine lovers will be thrilled with one of the best wine lists anywhere make sure to visit when you are in seattle."
1689,,1122,5,2/20/18,"this restaurant never disappoints. i had a lovely experience there for a birthday over the weekend. we had a the artichoke hearts, and crab cakes for appetizer, both were great choices. the french onion soup is one of the best i have ever had in a restaurant. the prime rib was cooked perfectly, and the horseradish was just spicy enough. to finish we had the creme brulee and chocolate cake - i could eat them both all day. the service was on point. i recommend this for special occasions as it is a bit pricey side, but if i had deep enough pockets i would be here every night."
1690,,1122,5,2/12/18,"let me preface by saying my fiance and i come here almost every other month - needless to say, this is our favorite steakhouse and the food never disappoints. ever. expect to drop a few pretty pennies. for starters, i would recommend their baby spinach salad if you are not into heavy appetizers. the combination of crispy bacon bits & fresh mozzarella is pretty amazing. crab cakes. good but nothing to write home about. definitely order the calamari though, it is got a nice little  kick to it with all the cherry peppers. the steaks. the steaks are amazing. i've tried their peppercorn, ribeye, filet mignon, porterhouse, new york. but my favorite is their blackened prime rib , medium rare. bone-in ribeye is also great tip you can request it blackened, which i recommend. i always get my steak with brussels sprouts and my fiance gets his with creamed spinach - we do not care for mashed potatoes or roasted veggies. and yes, you can ask to substitute. for the table, we always order the lobster mac & cheese - crispy yet tender with tons of lobster chunks. you do not need any sauce with your steak because it is so flavorful, but i need horseradish with mine. ask for both fresh and creamy horseradish. you can expect top-notch service from everyone working at the met - from valet to hostess to the servers. the servers are super friendly, not to mention knowledgeable, and very attentive."
1691,,1122,5,2/8/18,"visited the metropolitan grill for dinner on our first night out in seattle. we called around pm to make a reservation for around pm, but the nice lady we spoke to on the phone told us she could not accommodate us with a reservation because they were all booked throughout the night. nonetheless she informed us about the bar side and told us they have there full dinner menu as well. upon arrival we got our coats & umbrella tooken  care of and they were hung away for us inside a coat room. unfortunately there was no tables available at the bar side, but our host made sure she would sit us down in no time. we waited nearly - minutes to be seated. our server jennifer promptly introduced herself to us and offered us some drink choices . we opted for . a lemon drop martini . met manhattan . martini bombay sapphire . another martini i cannot recall the name .a local brewed tap beer i cannot recall the name of. for appetizers we opted for . fresh onion soup . clam chowder soup . classic ceaser salad these both soups are a must try they were supper delicious for our entrees we chose . american wagyu . filet mignon . blackened prime rib . alaskan lobster tail medium in size for dessert . chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream it was our servers treat since she told us the childcare was very rich in flavor. . home made ny cheesecake. felt like royalty service. & every single bite was to die for. cannot wait to dine here on another trip. it was worth every penny. +"
1692,,1122,1,1/28/18,great food. great waiter.  my  star is for the fact that we changed reservations to here  for the fact we were told they had the best prime rib in seattle. nowhere online or on the menu did it say limited availability.  so we went in knowing what we wanted for how much we could spend.  i ask the waiter the difference between the blackened cajun and regular prime rib .  no mention they are out.   he comes back to order and i'm told oh.  we may be out.   comes back and they are out of prime rib .  the whole reason we came there.    i asked to speak with the manager and after several mins before the time to go nothing.  no one came around.  instead of under  we spent  after tip since the rib eye and other steaks cost way more  than the prime rib .  so instead of the apps we wanted we had to only get these  expensive meals instead of the  each for prime rib .  the place was amazing. the staff amazing.  but the fact you run out of a meat you are known for on a saturday at pm.  ridiculous.   i love prime rib .  it is why we came. and instead i had a meal i did not really want because i had no choice at that point.  ruined my night when my wife was trying to take me out for what she knew i really wanted.
1693,,1122,4,12/30/17,"though i personally prefer new style of steak house, the old school ways still has a lot of charm and the met grill is the best place for it in seattle. being just a few blocks away from my work place, i come here quite a bit, where its my bosses treating me for a good job, coming for the great happy hour menu, or just lunch. though it can be a pricey restaurant, the options they have for lunch are a good value, especially there burgers, one of the best burger in seattle in my option. the other lunch option and the specials are pretty good a well, i just had the friday special of prime rib and it was excellent as expected. you cannot beat the value for the happy hour as well. as for the steak, of the ones that i tried they are all pretty good, nothing amazing given some of the other options around town, but never disappointing. the service is some of the best i had in seattle, always coming around to fill up water with out asking and all the other attentive things a good old school steak house should be like. for lunch they always ask if there is time constraints and will always get you in and our well under an hour."
1694,,1122,3,12/14/17,"mildly disappointed i have eaten at the met grill for  years +, though am not a regular. it is was arguably the best steak house in seattle great location, ambiance and service and great food. having said that,  friends of mine and i had dinner at the met last night and i was disappointed. i can cook a steak, but rely on the met for their prime rib particularly their cajun blackened prime rib . i left the cooking  preparation to the chef chef's discretion and perhaps that was my mistake. my  oz prime rib was as dry as toast and spiced way beyond what i was used to.i really should have sent it back, but a i did say chef's discretion on the way it was cooked and b  of our group had a ferry to vashon to catch so we had not the luxury of time. we noticed that jeff bezos was in house last night - so that might tell you something, as far as the met's position on the culinary cosmos here in seattle is concerned. i am pretty sure had jeff sent his prime rib back, the met would have tumbled for him. had i.well. i am not so sure. but  be fair and balanced, the service and ambiance were st class. but that may be the last time i darken their threshold."
1695,,1122,5,12/5/17,"went here for an anniversary dinner and it was amazing we were seated right away, the server was really attentive, and checked up on us quite often. the atmosphere was pretty relaxing and settled. i had the prime rib median well and it was really tender and juicy with a side of lobster mac and cheese which is the best, the lobster was really fresh"
1696,,1122,4,10/14/17,visited seattle recently for a convention. we were leaving a reception and decided to find a place to eat last minute. checked out the yelp app and came across the metropolitan grill. called and secured reservations for four people. the food was excellent. from the appetizers to main course. we had steaks and prime rib . cooked perfect. bananas foster was yummy. a must try if your a fan. definitely worth the four .
1697,,1122,4,10/13/17,we went here for our anniversary dinner. i had the ribeye dinner cooked medium a little chewy but overall great and the peppercorn steak sauce was a great addition to it. i had a side of crab legs and appetizer of prawn cocktail they were huge and delicious. i would definitely visit again and try the prime ribs this time.
1698,,1122,5,5/24/17,loved this meal. prime rib melted in my mouth. service was good. worth the price. the reputation is deserved.
1699,,1122,5,5/16/17,"we went to the met before the you concert. luckily we found a great seat at the end of the bar as thy were all booked for dinner. teddy the bar tender took care of us. he was very helpful and nice. he set us up with a great ipa and a cabernet for my wife. we had the wedge salad and split the lobster mac and cheese and the prime rib . you get what you pay for.it was all excellent it was a great way to start the night. by the way, you rocked a lot of earlier hits it was awesome"
1700,,1122,5,5/14/17,"this was a very nice dinner. i took my mom here for mothers day as this is her favorite place. the waitress was amazing blonde, older. the met did not disappoint. the seafood sampler to start was very nice and fresh. the prime rib was cooked to perfection. i always enjoy coming here and this visit was the top. thank you metropolitan grill for a wonderful visit, dinner, and experience."
1701,,1122,4,11/1/18,"my mother and i came here last sunday. the environment and the service were good. my mother and i shared a calamari as our appetizer, the calamari was ok. my mother got a  oz. filet mignon with baked potato and i got a salmon with baked potato. the steak and the salmon was so so. not delicious at all. both my mother and i do not like it. we had a new york cheesecake as our dessert, and i like the dessert. it was good. my drink was also good."
1702,,1122,5,7/19/18,"i dressed up pretty nicely for this place. just a floral dress and flats while my boyfriend did semi-formal with a button up and a sports coat. we were both a bit nervous about overdressing or not dressing up enough but when we got there, there was a variety of dress among the people. we were probably somewhere in the middle as there were a few guys in jeans, and some girls who wore maxi skirts or trousers. honestly, it would just depend on how comfortable you are with dressing up as the restaurant itself did not seem to mind or at least they did not say anything about those in jeans or way more under-dressed than the majority. we got to sit in a super comfy booth and the waiter was so awesome. he made a lot of jokes and was helpful when answering our questions and offering suggestions. for our meal, we ordered a calamari , candied bacon, an oz filet migon, and a oz of the ribeye. the calamari was excellent. it was not overly chewy or too salty. the candied bacon was honestly to die for. there are a lot of places i've had them at that were too much like jerky and much too tough. this one had the consistency of thick-cut bacon that was crispy on the outside yet chewy on the inside. it was sweet but not rot-your-teeth sweet. just what i was expecting. now for the main course. the steak was wonderful. i eat a lot of steak and honestly this was perfection. it was cooked with just the right amount of pink i asked for, and was sooooo juicy. it was really well seasoned and honestly, the baby carrots that came with it were superb as well. my boyfriend's steak was huuuuge and he probably was only able to finish it all because of how good it was. overall, i'm so glad we dressed up and were able to experience this place in all of it is glory. i will definitely come back one of these days."
1703,,1122,5,6/15/18,"wow very nice we came here for a celebration for a party of . we arrived early but were seated immediately. our server was super nice and always checking in on us. we ordered crab cake, calamari and lobster mac and cheese for appetizers. i think our favorite was the crab cake, although i kind of wish it was cut into smaller pieces to share. it came in  patties and we tried to cut it ourselves and kind of made a mess. i ordered a  oz filet mignon with mash potatoes. ok heres the thing, one do not underestimate the size of the meat my eyes were bigger than my stomach so i ordered  oz and i barely ate  of the steak which was really sad for me. two, probably do not order an appetizer if your stomach is small like mine. after the appetizer i was pretty much full and did not have enough room for my steak which was the star of my meal. aside for my personal complaints about not having enough stomach size, everything was so good i got a medium filet mignon and it was very well cooked, pink all the way through and all the juice is retained making it juicy and tender. very creamy mash potato, must have of had a lot of butter in it. we also ordered the banana flambe and the bananator put on a mini show for us. to put the cherry on top we saw the ceo of t-mobile dining at the same time definitely made me feel like a celebrity or something."
1704,,1122,5,5/8/18,"food and service were spectacular we had calamari , the beef stake and onion salad, the dungeoness crab and prawn linguine and the boneless ribeye. would highly recommend everything that we tried i know dress code is always controversial, we went in a nice dress and he work a button up shirt and jacket and fit in perfectly. the atmosphere was a big addition to the meal"
1705,,1122,5,4/9/18,"as first time visitors to seattle, we were so happy to find metropolitan grill to celebrate my parents  anniversary  we loved our experience so much we ate there three out of the five nights we were in town.  the wait staff is warm, welcoming and attentive we had the pleasure of having  mckenzie, julie, jim, kevin, michael, scott and the maitre d' craig who made our experience there wonderful  not only is the staff awesome the food is equally delicious  each night we started with a yummy appetizers.the meatballs are beyond delicious and the calamari is outstanding.  the steaks are cooked to perfection and the table side dessert is spectacular which craig made for us each night  you could not ask for a better ambiance for a restaurant and we will definitely be going back when we are in seattle again  thank you metropolitan grill for making our trip memorable"
1706,,1122,5,4/6/18,"this place was amazing we had crab cakes, calamari to start. i had a wonderfully filet mignon with an oz lobster tail and mashed potatoes. we share asparagus and brussel sprouts with bacon. ended with a raspberry sorbet. was a fabulous dinner and great service."
1707,,1122,5,2/12/18,"let me preface by saying my fiance and i come here almost every other month - needless to say, this is our favorite steakhouse and the food never disappoints. ever. expect to drop a few pretty pennies. for starters, i would recommend their baby spinach salad if you are not into heavy appetizers. the combination of crispy bacon bits & fresh mozzarella is pretty amazing. crab cakes. good but nothing to write home about. definitely order the calamari though, it is got a nice little  kick to it with all the cherry peppers. the steaks. the steaks are amazing. i've tried their peppercorn, ribeye, filet mignon, porterhouse, new york. but my favorite is their blackened prime rib, medium rare. bone-in ribeye is also great tip you can request it blackened, which i recommend. i always get my steak with brussels sprouts and my fiance gets his with creamed spinach - we do not care for mashed potatoes or roasted veggies. and yes, you can ask to substitute. for the table, we always order the lobster mac & cheese - crispy yet tender with tons of lobster chunks. you do not need any sauce with your steak because it is so flavorful, but i need horseradish with mine. ask for both fresh and creamy horseradish. you can expect top-notch service from everyone working at the met - from valet to hostess to the servers. the servers are super friendly, not to mention knowledgeable, and very attentive."
1708,,1122,3,2/12/18,"  stars *** i had high hopes for this place and was a little let down. my husband and i chose this place to come to for an early valentine's day dinner. after looking at the menu and the prices we assumed it would be a super fancy restaurant but we were sort of wrong. there were tvs in the bar area, people wearing jeans, and a good chunk of kids. judging from the designer bags i saw most women carrying with this seasons latest designer jackets, i'm guessing this is where rich people come to eat casually. my first turn off was how crowded the space is. you are constantly bumping into people. the aisles are way too tiny, and it becomes a nuisance when someone gets a table side show for a dish they order because it basically completely blocks the aisles. our table was also pretty small. second was the wait. it took over  minutes to get our entrees. aside from that i was not a fan of some of the things with our food. i got the seafood linguine and the sauce was way too liquidy. i kept getting the sauce on my face and dress. i purposefully stopped eating it. i also was not a fan of the brussels sprouts i have had better. the good things the service was pretty good and our waiter michael did a great job taking care of us. the calamari appetizer was super tasty and i loved how light and crispy it was. the waigu beef my husband ordered. best steak i have ever had. ever. melt in your mouth goodness. the crab in my linguine was too die for. tasted amazing. and last but not least, the hot apple pie dessert was sooooo good. great way to finish off the dinner."
1709,,1122,5,11/27/17,"this is going to now be one of my new favorite steak houses the big green comfortable seating is so nice to relax and enjoy a great meal. our service was exceptional as well. food also spot on we started with oysters, calamari and scallops. the scallops were so interesting, i had never had scallops prepared this way before.almost like a breading on them. after appetizers we tried the lobster bisque, clam chowder, caesar salad and the wedge, all very yummy. for dinner my friends had the ohmi filet. i tried a bite, literally melts in your mouth. i had the  day aged  oz it was also amazing we were too stuffed after all the food to get to dessert, but next time for sure i could smell the caramel and the sugar from the table next too us who ordered the table side bananas foster. cannot wait to come back"
1710,,1122,2,11/26/17,"honestly, the met has been my favorite steakhouse for the past  years i went back today with my friends and we were all disappointed. it is just not as good as before anymore  we ordered - a dozen of oysters - calamari  - crab cake  - lobster mac & cheese  - clam chowder - caesar salad - filet mignon medium rare - top cap sirloin medium rare - boneless ribeye medium rare this is my order - new york strip medium rare - banana foster  too slow we waited for  minutes for our entree  im not talking about the old superpacked, - hour wait dinner night. i'm talking about a night with only about % tables occupied. it is not a full house night where all the seats were seated.  calamari they downsized the portion and it was not as flavorful as before  crab cakes the taste was alright but the texture was disappointing. the crab cakes were not holding on to each other.  lobster mac & cheese this was one disappointing dish  we could not taste the lobster in it probably because there were barely any lobster pieces in the dish.  overcooked boneless ribeye my ribeye was overcooked and it does not look like a ribeye  they had to make me a new one.  banana foster just as good as i remembered it was so good the sweetness of the banana plus cinnamon plus rum equals to perfecto. it is something you cannot go wrong i am not sure if i will be returning to metropolitan grill just yet. there are so many other restaurants i would like to try in seattle until next time"
1711,,1122,3,9/16/17,"if i was rating the met on just the food this would be a  star review. i've been  times and each time i've left thinking, i would like those calories back. it just is not amazing. it really is not even memorable. took the boyfriend last night because he is never been and well when you talk about steak in seattle the met is always in the mix. i was not expecting to be blown away by any means but hoped for at least a good meal. here's what we had, their house bread a bottle of elk cove pinot noir calamari lobster bisque boneless ribeyes wroot vegetables choc lava cake burnt cream creme brulee what we enjoyed the bread wine lobster bisque root veggies both desserts notice the star of the show at the met, the steaks were not mentioned they were actually tough and difficult to cut even with the steak knives. i just gave up on mine about a quarter of the way through. the bright spot here is always the wait staff. our server was friendly, kept the wine glasses full. when she noticed my plate was mostly untouched she asked if i had liked it. i said, it was all ok but the steak was just a little tough. it was not meant as a formal, let me bitch it out moment just an honest answer to why i had not eaten much. she promptly removed the meal from the bill. i would have paid the entire bill without a complaint had she not asked. kudos for such a gracious gesture. the tip left was figured on what the bill would have been with that nd meal because she served it and took great care of us throughout. so now we can move on to other steakhouse's. boyfriend has tried the met and while you never say never it will be a very long while before we venture back. as far as price i see a lot of reviews for nice restaurants where people complain about price. i think it is really silly to go out for a great meal then complain about the cost. this ticket was about  with tip. chances are if you go you will really enjoy it. most do. for my time and money though i would prefer el gaucho or ruths chris."
1712,,1122,3,9/16/17,"a great date night started here. this is the first time i've ever been to the met.  i would heard about this place a lot if you want a great steak.  now i can say i've been there and now i can disagree with everyone that says this is the place to go. i dig the decor which tries to keep it old school steakhouse.  the service was pretty good.  our server was prompt but not pushy.  drinks were never empty.  and overall she was just friendly and smiled.  she also volunteered to remove an entree from our check after a quick side comment about how tough my girlfriends steak was.  it was not even intended to be a complaint to our server, just a quick comment that was made during conversation.  while we did not think the removal was necessary, my compliments to the server for her awareness of what people are saying about their meals. both of us ordered the boneless ribeye. one medium and one medium rare.  both of them were rough around the edges and in a couple spots difficult to cut even with the steak knife.  i've only been to four steakhouses now but i rank this steak fourth of four.  el gaucho, ruth's chris and daniels broiler fall ahead of it, in that order.  the roasted root veggies that came with the steak were good. the calamari was good but nothing exceptional. it was the same calamari you can get anywhere.  the lobster bisque was good as well but a bit too big of a portion for what i was expecting.  tasty though.you definitely get a lobster flavor.  roasted poblano scalloped potatoes were great.  i thought it was a creative menu item and i'm glad i tried it.  for dessert.burnt cream and the chocolate lava cake.  both were bomb  the chocolate lava cake should be shared between a couple people though.  it is big and very rich.  for the burnt cream.get your own and keep your spoons to yourself.   we had the elk cove pinot noir with dinner and thought it was great.  if you are looking for a sophisticated wine review about flavor profiles, you have got the wrong guy.  it was not too heavy and went really well with what we had. i'm not writing off the met since i've only had one experience but there are other places i will try before i head back."
1713,,1122,2,8/28/17,"we ate there last night. this is the first time i've ever written a yelp review. i just had to say something about our dining experience at the metropolitan grill. firstly the staff were efficient, friendly and informed. no issues there. what i do take issue with is the lack of quality of their food. we ordered filets, pepper steak and a large lobster tail. all top priced items. we also had calamari , asparagus and what was supposed to be roasted cauliflower.  none of it measured up. steaks cooked incorrectly, limp asparagus and chewy dry calamari . i do mean chewy. this is a popular seattle establishment. one that is been here for a long time. over the past  years, i've probably gone to - business dinners there. i think that may be the point. business dinners paid for with generous expense accounts do not get the scrutiny. however special occasion dinners paid for by an individual, albeit a retired ceo, bear a closer look. ok i get it. i should let it go. i can afford it, right well i suppose you are right. i can. but damn sam i hate to be top dollar and get handed sub par fare. i will not be going back. i will just remember the good old days when an  steak meant something."
1714,,1122,4,5/29/17,"the food was great, as we had been told by friends although great, my husband said he liked the steak better from places such as john howie and daniel's.  wine selection was amazing, as they had a large amount of half bottles perfect as only my husband drinks wine.  they also had three cider selections, which i was pleased with.  the calamari was amazing, probably the best i've ever had high quality, perfect type & amount of breading, and a nice sauce.  the french onion soup was good.  steak was great.  asparagus with bernaise was good.  mashed potatoes were great.  ceasar salad was great.  creme brulee was amazing. however, the ambiance was not what we have come to expect from high end steakhouses like this.the entire place is open ie. not private, and the decor is dated.  even the menu material seemed cheap laminated.  however, they are closing soon for  months for a remodel, so hopefully that will be fixed.  the service was great, but not amazing, like we would expect for a  dinner.  for example, after our dessert was cleared we waited about  minutes for the check, our server nowhere to be seen.  for the price, we are more likely to go to john howie or daniel's we were not a fan of el gaucho, and are kinda over ruth's chris."
1715,,1122,4,5/16/17,"i've been here two times, once on a date and another this past weekend where i took my family out to dinner for mother's day. both times have been decent experiences where the service was great but the steaks themselves felt generic. since i went with  people this past weekend i was able to practically try their entire menu. from the top of my head we had for apps the seafood platter, calamari , crab cakes, lobster bisque. for entrees we had the filet mignon, the  day dry aged cap, ribeye, rack of lamb, dungeness crab fettuccini, chicken, and wagyu. for dessert we tried he cheesecake and banana foster. the steaks were hit or miss, everything that was not the filet mignon's felt a little tough and dry. considering i spent over  i expected the best steaks in town to be the best steaks in town. the chicken was overcooked and very dry but after we brought it up to our waitress she comped the chicken and gave us a free entree which my uncle decided to get the oz wagyu oz prime which was about  so that really made the service stand out. i loved how well she handled the situation and the mini history lesson with the banana foster guy was nice as well told us about how el gaucho was really el sloucho.lol. food was  and service was , would i go here again probably not unless it was free. but definitely worth trying at least once considering it is an iconic steakhouse in seattle"
1716,,1122,3,3/18/17,i've always wanted to try this place and today my hubby and i decided to treat our parents out to a fancy dinner so we decided to come here. i was super excited to see what all the fuss was about at the met. i ordered everything that sounded delicious because i knew i would not come back for a while. to my disappointment everything i ordered i had better somewhere else. here's how i rated everything. calamari was  crab cakes  scallops  spinach salad  claim chowder  lobster mac n cheese  american wagyu  bread  nine layer cake  carrot cake  service was great.  atmosphere  bathroom  really this place is expensive because of the name and the hype but honestly you can get better food elsewhere. i'm still happy i tried it. just do not go in expecting mind blowing food.
1717,,1122,5,3/18/17,"came here for a company celebration during lunchtime. it was delicious the grill had a large variety of entrees and dishes varying from sandwiches, burgers, calamari , steak, lobster and more i ordered the american wagyu with the mashed potatoes and a side of caesar salad that can come with optional anchovies. the steak was great - but to my surprise what really made it amazing was the mashed potatoes i'm a sucker for great mash potatoes. our waiter was very accommodating and friendly. read us all the menus and made sure we knew all the specials and dishes that were not always on the menu. drinks were served first, then the dishes all together. the waiters would come by and check on us and always refilled our water was good since i decided not to drink but kept chugging water. finished off the main course and the waiter sincerely asked if we wanted dessert. i had the new york cheesecake out of the dozen or so items on their menu, which was good and included a few berries on top. overall experience was amazing, can be a high-end place if you order the steak or seafood, but also a great place to stop by for lunch if you want a sandwich or burger. must try to mash potatoes"
1718,,1122,5,3/9/17,"one word amazing was here with a big group. got our own room. we ordered pretty much everything from lobster mac & cheese, onion rings, calamari , steaks, pork chop, oyster shooters, and  kinds of desserts. everything was just magnificent. i ordered rib eye with garlic mashed potatoes. steak was cooked to perfection. nicely seared on the outside while pink and juicy on the inside. garlic mashed could have been a main dish on its own. it was rich and fluffy. we ordered desserts to share. my favorites were carrot cake and cheesecake. i always have a soft spot for those. one of the best carrot cakes i've ever had. if you must stick with only one dessert, go with the carrot cake and you would not be disappointed."
1719,,1122,5,1/18/17,"one of the best place i have tried in the city. always lovely service and accommodating. have tried a wide variety of items on the menu, all were perfectly done. although it is a steak place, my favorite item is the calamari . it is always fried just right and comes with amazing sauce. would highly recommend to give it a try if you have not yet done so"
1720,,1122,5,11/22/16,every time i go to a big city i have to check out their best steakhouse. i made reservations for my girlfriend and i online. from the moment we walked in everything was fantastic. their mojito was great. we ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was great. we both ordered the skirt steak and it was cooked to perfection. the best part of the meal was the table side apple pie which knocked our socks off. my mouth still waters thinking about it. overall it was a great experience.
1721,,1122,2,10/28/18,"had dinner there  with my daughter.  we both had the french onion soup , she had calimari while i had the prime rib, scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach.  to end, she had the carrot cake and i had the  layer chocolate cake. what a disappointment.  the best part of the dinner was the onion soup .  the calimari was slightly greasy, but the biggest problem was how salty the prime rib and scalloped potatoes were.  had to use excessive horseradish to counteract.  even the end of the meal was disappointing.  carror cake was moist, but  layer chocolate cake was like eating sand.  do not think i have ever tasted a drier desert.  all this for over .  money not well spent."
1722,,1122,2,9/5/18,"we had dinner here on saturday, sept. st. there were  people in our party, and they sat us at a very nice table.  however, the only thing that was hot when we got it was the french onion soup .  we all had some kind of steak with potato, and both were cold when we got them  not a good thing for what is supposed to be a  star restaurant in seattle  then there was the % service charge that was added to the bill.  they said it was because the minimum wage had gone up to  and hr. in seattle, but i would rather they raise their prices a bit, than stick that % on the bill.  probably will never go back."
1723,,1122,5,2/20/18,"this restaurant never disappoints. i had a lovely experience there for a birthday over the weekend. we had a the artichoke hearts, and crab cakes for appetizer, both were great choices. the french onion soup is one of the best i have ever had in a restaurant. the prime rib was cooked perfectly, and the horseradish was just spicy enough. to finish we had the creme brulee and chocolate cake - i could eat them both all day. the service was on point. i recommend this for special occasions as it is a bit pricey side, but if i had deep enough pockets i would be here every night."
1724,,1122,5,1/17/18,"people rave about this seattle classic - supposedly is a must try place and they were right. classic restaurant - old school steakhouse. velvet green booths. waiter ins white coats - amazing service i would come back on the service alone. they were so accommodating and helpful. i never went dry on water - i am a sucker for constant water refills lol - got the kettle one mule, it was delicious i actually had  started my night with the french onion soup . to die for cheesy and gooey goodness. must try to we had the metropolitan prawn cocktail huge and the kobe meatballs over garlic cheesy polenta so good. for my main course i got the oz filet mignonoz wagyu medium well with mash potatoes. it cooked to perfection and i killed it. to share we had lobster mac and cheese, brussels sprouts and mushroom. all delicious last but not least we had the bananas fosters it was dinner and a show, they cooked it right at the table. worth the show and taste divine. loved this place would gladly come again."
1725,,1122,5,1/14/18,"if you are looking for a nice dinning experience this is the place. they have amazing service and great steaks. i enjoyed my entree which was a combination plate the had both a  oz. american wagu filet and  oz. prime filet.  my cousin got the ribeye which he loved, as well.  all of the entrees come with one side which is enough if you get a starter.  we both order our own stater i got the french onion soup and my cousin the wedge.  we order the brussel sprouts as a side but it was too much food, even though they were delicious. for dessert we had to try the bananas foster which is made tableside.  james was our waiter and he was professional and attentive. an overall great dinning experience that i would come back to if i'm back in town."
1726,,1122,5,10/25/17,"the metropolitan grill has consistently gained my respect as the finest restaurant i've ever had the pleasure of dining at. few other establishments can compete with the exemplary product and professional service the met never fails to provide. i religiously order the rib eye steak and baked potato with french onion soup as an appetizer i highly recommend the soup  and am constantly impressed by ever aspect of the experience. that is truly what this restaurant is - an experience. the wait staff is incredibly friendly, treating even the rudest customer like royalty. even watching the waiter dress your baked potato in premier ingredients is an impressive show. the best decision you could make would be to forego the price and dine at the met. it is an event you will never forget."
1727,,1122,2,10/5/17,"we visited the metropolitan grill for dinner on our first day in seattle visiting out of town and left with a lot of displeasure. after reading several reviews and hearing how wonderful metropolitan grill was, we did not have the same experience. our dining experience started off wonderful but was ruined midway through our dinner. we made reservations at  pm but arrived a little early at  and the hostess was able to accommodate us only having to wait about  minutes. once seated, we were greeted by our server requesting our drink orders and provided fresh warm bread to start with. he went over all of the meat selections along with the specials on the menu for the night. since this was our annual guys trip that we budget for, we wanted to try the best selections from the menu. for six people we ordered drinks ordered some specialty cocktails met mango margarita, mezcal mule and another drink appetizer king crab cakes, almond crusted scallops, french onion soup , lobster bisque and tenderloin tartar main entrees boneless ribeye, olive steak oscar style, cap top steak, hokkaido filet, ohmi filet,  australian lobster tails sides lobster macaroni and cheese dessert banana foster and hot apple pie before our order was placed we received our cocktail drinks and they were all good except for one. we then started receiving our appetizers which were also very tasteful and presented nicely. once our appetizer finished, it took quite some time for our steaks to arrive which we did not mind as the restaurant seemed pretty busy. however once our steak arrived, for a high end steak restaurant we would expect our server to ask us to cut into our steaks making sure it was cooked to our desired temperature but this did not happen and our waiter left the table. the result of this was that one of our friends that ordered the cap steak med-rare came out to med to med-well and both of our lobster tails seemed very tough or overcooked. in addition to the cap steak, the presentation was not expected as this meat was sliced into pieces instead of one whole piece like the others causing the steak to cook even more to a well done since the plate was hot and the juices were flowing out. after most of us started digging into our meal, it took almost  minutes until our waiter came back to check on us realizing that the cap steak was overcooked. he immediately took the plate and stated it would be - min to have another replaced and provided a small crab cocktail for the guest to enjoy while waiting. after - minutes everyone was finished with their food and the waiters assistant removed everyone's plate leaving the sides. we pushed all of our sides along with the lobster to our one friend that still did not have his steak to eat while he was waiting. finally after about  minutes he received his steak and it was cooked to the desired temperature. we all watched him rush on eating his steak leaving an uncomfortable experience since everyone was done. after our main entrees, we ordered the hot apple pie and banana foster for two. the presentation and dessert were both very wonderful but i would mention that each of the desserts could be for four people at least. around  we received our tab and it was well over one-thousand dollars after tip. this was not a normal dinner and like most people it is a privilege to dine out nice every once in awhile. overall for a high end restaurant, we did not enjoy our meals due to the experience and presentation of the entrees we had. we would not really suggest it to our friends or family back home. for a restaurant with a rich history and high reviews we really expected more."
1728,,1122,5,8/14/17,"after a two month renovation, they opened again tonight and were right back on target the panko and almond crusted scallops were great the french onion soup was fantastic the mashed potatoes and filet mignon were so good, i could not even finish. i have some leftovers for tomorrow"
1729,,1122,4,5/29/17,"the food was great, as we had been told by friends although great, my husband said he liked the steak better from places such as john howie and daniel's.  wine selection was amazing, as they had a large amount of half bottles perfect as only my husband drinks wine.  they also had three cider selections, which i was pleased with.  the calamari was amazing, probably the best i've ever had high quality, perfect type & amount of breading, and a nice sauce.  the french onion soup was good.  steak was great.  asparagus with bernaise was good.  mashed potatoes were great.  ceasar salad was great.  creme brulee was amazing. however, the ambiance was not what we have come to expect from high end steakhouses like this.the entire place is open ie. not private, and the decor is dated.  even the menu material seemed cheap laminated.  however, they are closing soon for  months for a remodel, so hopefully that will be fixed.  the service was great, but not amazing, like we would expect for a  dinner.  for example, after our dessert was cleared we waited about  minutes for the check, our server nowhere to be seen.  for the price, we are more likely to go to john howie or daniel's we were not a fan of el gaucho, and are kinda over ruth's chris."
1730,,1122,5,5/26/17,"wow just wow this review is for when i was in seattle during july, went in on the th so there was no traffic and parking was simple and easy.  we had originally wanted to go to tilth but, they were closed for the fourth of july unfortunately. but oh man am i glad that they were closed, otherwise i would not have had the chance to eat at this glorious establishment.  place is very nice and fancy, very upscale steakhouse.  we had started with the steak tartare which was phenomenal, best steak tartare i have ever had in my life, everything about about it was just great  i had also ordered the french onion soup which was maybe not the best but still very good.  and then on to the main course which was the ohmi filet mignon, this was the most tender, buttery, and juiciest filet mignon i have ever had.  worth every damn penny.  suffice to say it was not a cheap meal.  had the usual baked potato as a side which is a must for me whenever i eat steak.  on to the service which was efficient, kind, helpful and quite speedy.  our waiter was like a psychic ninja.  had a great time here and am looking forward to another visit the next time i am in seattle."
1731,,1122,3,2/3/17,"when i first lived in seattle around ten years ago and i would ask what is the best steakhouse in the city the answer was almost always the met. there were certainly some other worthy contenders to the throne - daniel's, el gaucho, john howie, and even jack's way out in issaquah, just to name a few - but generally everyone was in agreement that this classic old school place was a seattle institution second to none. and, they were right while other places could claim better service, more tasteful interiors, or attentive service, there was no better meat and the preparation there of than what i found here. work took me away from seattle for a number of years but since i've returned and been to the met a few times i've been really disappointed with my meals. i have been back three times and each time the steak has been cooked incorrectly asked for medium rare, got medium to medium-well now, they are always sorry and accommodating one time taking the cost of the steak entirely off my bill but serving steak at the wrong temperature is just steakhouse faux pas number one and should not be a pattern at the city's finest - after all, i have to sit around and wait for a new steak to be prepared and everyone else at the table likely is going to either wait or eat awkwardly while i stare at their food. in the past i've found the rest of the food at the met underwhelming compared to other establishments but it was always balanced out by the steak. this has not changed much with most appetizers and accompaniments being really standard, conservative stuff that never really entices me to try much. last time i ordered their french onion soup and unlike the usual dance of hearty beef stock with nutty cheese and a bit of wine, the soup itself is almost slightly but blandly sweet - i'm definitely not a fan of this one. the interior is in deep need of a refresh as well. the met usually has the lights adjusted a little brighter than i would enjoy i prefer el gaucho's flashlight required tuning and that has the effect of illuminating some of the age of the place the carpet in particular does not look like it has been replaced since the first day i walked in there nearly ten years ago. sadly based on my last few visits i think the met has dropped below all of the other great seattle institutions and even some of the new ones like the butcher's table."
1732,,1122,3,1/9/17,i have dined for years at this restaurant and have always enjoyed everything about it.  this time was a little disappointing.  everything was warm.not hot.  i ordered french onion soup which should have been left in the oven longer.  the cheese is supposed to be crusty but mine was soft and just melted and soup itself was just warm.  our steaks were properly cooked but also just warm when brought to the table and the au jus the waiter brought to pour over the steak was luke warm which made the steak even cooler.  we ordered a side of mushrooms and like everything else.just warm.   i was so wanting something hot that i ordered an after dinner spanish coffee and even asked that it be hot when it arrives.  the waiter did bring me a nice and hot spanish coffee.in a glass .that was too hot to pick up.  i then flagged down a suit and asked it my coffee could be served in a cup or glass with a handle so that i could enjoy it while it was hot.  we get to seattle a couple times a year and always make it a point to dine at the met.  i think next time we will expand our horizons as there are many good high end steak houses in seattle.
1733,,1122,5,10/25/16,"top  best dinner experiences in my  years of life we we are there october th celebrating the seahawks win and my birthday and just wandered in for dinner thanks to a recommendation from the marriott. amazing food and atmosphere. the staff were full of smiles and conversation from the beginning to the end. they were really busy, but the maitre d kevin went above and beyond to make our evening special and our server stephanie i think was a sweetheart and a great sport in the chaos after a hawks game. i cannot even begin to give justice to the scallops, french onion soup , prime rib and table-side apple crisp.wow. stars thank you.we will be back on our next trip to seattle"
1734,,1122,5,10/21/16,"the price is well worth it, my filet was to die for i am so happy we stopped here while visiting seattle. it is a huge restaurant, but the service and food times were up to par. i started with the oysterswhich were so fresh, and the french onion soup to warm me up. both were fantastic. had the oz filet mignon with mash potatoes as the side. so filling and the meat was so tender ahh i need to go back."
1735,,1122,2,7/9/16,"first let me say that we are typically unimpressed with steak houses, only because we can make a steak at home better than most. but, we went to the met grill to try one of the premier steak houses in the country. starting with the positives, the service was very good.  and the sourdough bread was served warm, pretty good but we are not fans of whipped butter. still good though.  and lastly if you are a fan of huge portions, than i guess this is a positive as well. we split everything which was a great move the bench style booth seats were uncomfortable. like airplane seating. definitely needs an updating with the seating. we decided to split everything. the caesar salad was overdressed, very old school. we ordered the french onion soup and it was pretty good but very very rich. at this point we probably should have stopped because we were getting full.  but we ordered a split of the prime new york steak, baker and the root vegetables. the baker was good but they offered a cheese sauce over the potato. hmmmmm. the root veggies were not impressive. slightly underdone, and way way to many. the steak was awful. it sensed like it was broiled. no char on it at all. a little tough. wow. and we decided to try the dessert. the coconut cake was huge and stale. lastly the wine list was extensive and the mark up was - times over most wine list. ridiculously overpriced.  dollar wines were marked to -. so disappointing. never again. lastl"
1736,,1122,4,1/10/16,"we came here after a seahawks game and it was a perfect way to unwind. we intentionally did not load up on stadium food so we could enjoy dinner here. this is just like your standard fancy steak joint. you get a small piece of steak for a premium price, and that is literally all you get. you have to pay for everything extra. potato, veggies, everything. they made a big deal about having % true japanese wagyu and even had it in a display case, so we had to try that. also i always try out a steakhouse's french onion soup , as that is one of my standards that i use to pass judgement on a steak house. they were both very good but i still stick by my opinion that this does not taste quite like wagyu in japan. i know i'm heavily biased so take that for what it is worth. i highly recommend that you try the bananas foster for dessert. they use captain morgan rum and flambee it right at your tableside which is pretty cool. this place will probably run you about  per person, give or take, so be aware. and definitely make reservations this place is crowded"
1737,,1122,5,12/13/15,"the met was absolutely amazing, from the service to the food to the atmosphere everything was amazing. we started with the crab cakes and calamari and a half bottle of pinot noir from king estates. everything was fantastic down to the aioli sauce for the calamari. what i really liked about the calamari was that they did not only include the rings they had lots of the tentacles which were done very nicely. the sweet jicama slaw under the crab cakes was also great. the french onion soup was fantastic, lots of cheese and lots of flavor. you should definitely get the french onion soup when here. we split this and they gave us very nice portions with cheese on top of both for an entree we got the waygu beef from hokkaido. our server was very knowledgeable about the beef and suggested getting it done medium and it came out brilliantly. my girlfriend and i split it so she got the mashed potatoes and i got the steak frittes. the mashed potatoes were a major winner the split is an extra  but it gets you another side. for a surprise desert our server brought us a creme brulee for my girlfriends birthday and it was fantastic. highly recommend checking this place out"
1738,,1122,5,11/10/15,"the customer service is excellent and the food is very good. despite it being such a large establishment the food is served quickly. the lobster bisque, clean chowder, and french onion soup are all excellent starters. the blackened rib eye is divine and the lobster mac n cheese is a must definitely stop by"
1739,,1122,1,6/21/15,"so disappointed.root vegetables were cold and blandly seasoned and the steak was full of gristle & poorly seasoned and rather dry.  first three bites i had to spit out.  cedar mushrooms on the side were served cold and dry.  at  a head shame on you french onion soup was good at least.but seriously, how would they have messed the soup up"
1740,,1122,4,2/8/15,"i visited this place while i was in seattle on business.  i really enjoyed it and, despite the price, i would gladly come back here again. walking in, the place was classy.  i felt like was walking into a high-end steakhouse from the 's, with the linen tablecloths and dark woodwork everywhere - and that was a good thing.  i do not mean it was run-down like an old building, but that it was classy. i started my meal with the french onion soup .  it was probably the best french onion soup i have ever had.  the cheese had a great taste and the broth was perfectly savory.  if the steak was not so huge and excellent, i would easily make this my appetizer, main course and dessert the next time i visit i ordered an aged new york strip for my main course, along with a twice-baked potato.  here's the thing, and you might think i am a little weird, but i do not like rare meat.  i know that might be sacrilegious for a good steak, but i just cannot do it.  when it is soft and bloody, i just cannot get over the thought of eating flesh.  i tend to order my steaks medium to medium-well, depending on where i am at.  since this place was supposed to be good, i expected the cooks would be able to hit the correct temperature on the steak, so i ordered it medium i was not disappointed. my steak was done perfectly.  it had just the right amount of char on the outside and was juicy on the inside.  it was tender and tasty and was the perfect end to a long day. my side - the twice-baked potato was good, but nothing to write home about.  however, one of my friends ordered the au gratin, potatoes with poblano peppers mixed in.  if i had it to do all over again, i would order these.  they were excellent hmmm. french onion soup with a side of those au gratin potatoes  if i would not get burned at the steak pun intended, haha, i could make a meal out of those two dishes alone in total, with a glass of iced tea, and no dessert, my order came to just under  just for myself, so do not come here if you are looking for a cheap dinner. i will say, however, that i felt it was worth every penny.  i will definitely be back."
1741,,1121,3,11/5/18,"ordered chowder sampler, but as they put bacon in new england clam chowder had to limit only to seafood - base chowder  seafood brisque and manhattan chowder . seafood brisque was creamy and yummy. but tomato-heavy manhattan chowder was off the mark, and had chewy clams . also ordered fried oyster poboy. the quantity of poboy  for  inches and quality was not good. i think this chowder place is good only for their namesake dish  chowder . you get better and bigger sandwiches elsewhere."
1742,,1121,4,11/2/18,"i tried  different chowders and the bisque. i will not bore you with all the details.the long and the short of it was everything was at least decent but the original new england clam chowder was fantastic, head and shoulders above anything else. so stick to that. you do not need to do a sampler. i took off  star for some operational issues. you do not see what the market chowder of the day is until you get near the front of the line, which is not very helpful for figuring out your order ahead of time. i checked in on yelp to get the  off the sampler, told the cashier i checked in on yelp, and did not get the  off. finally, after i ordered i saw all these open containers of open chowder on a tray and i said oh, this is to go. they seemed somewhat annoyed. they should ask for here or to go at the start of the order to avoid this issue."
1743,,1121,4,10/28/18,"pretty awesome clam chowder . i would not necessarily rank it the best but it was very good. we ordered the original new england clam chowder and the seafood bisque. both of them were packed with loads of clams and potatoes and the sourdough bread bowl had the crusty exterior and airy, soft interior which was perfection. i felt that both soups were a bit salty on its own. we had to drink lots of water and pretty much ate all the bread that came along with it to balance the saltiness. this place is an iconic location so beware the line will be very very long and seating is very limited. i would recommend one person wait in line while the other scout out for seating. nevertheless, the service is fairly quick so do not be discouraged by the long line."
1744,,1121,5,10/24/18,"definitely one of the best chowders i had. the line for this place is always super long, but it goes by pretty quickly too. i was down the block but ended up waiting for maybe  minutes and got to my turn. we ordered the four samplers just to try the different flavors and also the new england clam chowder in a bread bowl.  my favorite was the special of the day for that day. it was corn, lobster, and sweet corn. omg, it was so delicious, super flavorful and creamy. we shared between two people and both of us were really full before even finishing all the soups. it comes with sour dough bread too. they do offer online ordering if you just want to pick it up and not dine in. definitely try this place if you are around pike place market"
1745,,1121,5,10/23/18,"this place is chowder paradise there are so many options and varieties of chowder  we ordered and shared a quart of new england clam chowder , manhattan clam chowder and seafood bisque chowder . slices of sourdough bread were included with the soup and there were extra slices that are up for grabs by the utensils area. tip- lines are super long but it moves fast. if you just want to order soup, order thru their website and just walk up to their mobile ordering pickup booth."
1746,,1121,4,10/22/18,pretty good clam chowder place. we got their sampler which was good to try differernt things but our favorite was their new england clam chowder . next time probably just order that. we also had their connecticut style crab roll which was ok. i do not think it was worth the price and probably will not get it again. lines can be long but you can order online and pick it up during certain times. worth checking out once
1747,,1121,5,10/21/18,"do not understand why someone reared it lower for bad service for a  min wait, service has nothing to do with it.  you walk up, order, pay and take your delicious chowder , rolls andor salad.  the wait has to do with the demand.  you do not want to wait, either order ahead online or do not wait in line, go somewhere else. i got the x sampler - scallop chowder favorite, seafood bisque wait, maybe this was my favorite, traditionalnew england clam chowder very good, and manhattan style clam chowder way too tomatoey for my taste and split the original dungeness crab roll, which was also very tasty."
1748,,1121,5,10/20/18,"get the new england clam chowder . we got the  bowl sampler new england clam chowder smoked salmon chowder market chowder crab, lobster, corn crab & oyster of the , we loved the new england clam chowder . the one we liked the least was the smoked salmon. i tried the new england clam chowder last and wow it blew the other  out of the water. no wonder these guys have so many awards. we went around lunchtime but got lucky as the line was short. even then, the line moved pretty quickly. our  bowl sampler came with slices of sourdough which was really just perfect for us. something about watching people order the chowder in a bread bowl and then proceed to discard the bread bowl when they are done just hurts. disclaimer, the  bowls are pretty small. they have the  bowl sampler as well. be sure to obey the table rules. and also look for the mat on the ground that says to keep clear. you will be doing everyone a favor."
1749,,1121,5,10/18/18,"expect to wait in line for this place but they seem to move fast to get it going.  waited about - minutes.  ended up getting the sampler to taste four chowders .  got the new england clam , seared scallops chowder , coconut lime and crab and oyster chowders .  coconut lime want my thing but others seem to enjoy it.  the scallops chowder tasted the best.  flavor was just right and not too salty. new england and crab oyster chowder were also good and flavorful.  i would recommend this place to be a stop if you are in seattle."
1750,,1121,3,10/16/18,"this place is super popular.  i went at lunchtime on the weekend and there were two lines out the door.  it took at least  minutes to get to order. i went with the chowder sampler - seafood bisque, new england clam chowder , market chowder crab, lobster, and sweet corn, and seared scallop chowder .  for  for  oz., it is quite a hefty price to pay.  so, i would hope that it was some stellar chowder . well, it was good chowder , but not the best i've ever had.  the seafood bisque did not have enough seafood taste in it.  the market chowder , seared scallop chowder , and new england chowder all tasted pretty much the same.  if it were not for the different meats in them, i would not be able to tell the difference to what i was eating.  ultimately, in my opinion, it is overhyped but, if you are crazy about chowder , then give it a try."
1751,,1121,5,10/13/18,"if you love clam chowder , this is definitely the place to go. my husband and i went on a mini honeymoon to seattle and this place was on the top of my list to try. trust me, it will not disappoint. the lines can get pretty long, though. but i would say it is well worth the wait. my husband and i got lucky though, we went at off times around . so we missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner rush. please note that they have two locations, the super popular one near pike place market that is on  post alley. and the other location is a couple blocks up the street at pacific place center. both locations are equally delicious. so if it is too crowded at the post alley location, i would try the pacific place center. depending on the time it might be slightly less crowded. the first time we went to the post alley location. we ordered half of the original dungeness crab roll and half of the maine lobster roll. both were excellent. both crab and lobster were so fresh. we also ordered of course, the new england clam chowder in the sourdough bowl and the seafood bisque. again, both were excellent and most importantly, they do not skimp on the seafood. as for which is better for the sandwiches, i think it just depends which you like better, crab or lobster. as for the soups, it also depends if you like a tomato based broth or not. if you do the seafood bisque is awesome. i actually could not decide which soup i liked more. that is why when my husband and i ate there a second time. we ordered both the chowder and the bisque again. as for the rolls, my husband preferred the lobster roll, so we just got a whole lobster roll instead of a half. if you do decide to go here, i would advise trying what we got. they also offer a sampler platter of the soups if you really cannot decide what to get. i will definitely come back when i visit seattle."
1752,,1121,4,10/13/18,"my boyfriend and i were doing some pike place food hopping and stopped in here based on the amazing reviews. the line was enormous but moved pretty quickly - we were wrapped around all the way to rachel's ginger beer and still only waited maybe  min. we shared a four chowder sampler. we got the new england clam chowder , the seafood bisque, the scallop chowder , and the special lobster and corn chowder . the sampler came with bread on the side. we both really liked all of the chowders , we went into it thinking the lobster would be our favorite, but it was probably our least favorite. we realized the other chowders on our tray tasted more like a traditional new england clam chowder than their actual clam chowder did. my favorite was the scallop chowder and my boyfriend's the seafood bisque. if we came back, we would probably just get bowls of those soups."
1753,,1121,5,10/12/18,loved this place new england clam chowder in a bread bowl.delish perfect place to dine for lunch on a cold fall afternoon.
1754,,1121,4,10/12/18,"if you are ok with waiting for awhile during peak times, try this spot the seafood bisque and new england clam chowder were delicious and i would definitely have those again. the half-order dungeness crab roll was underwhelming in size and taste, but otherwise our overall experience was positive. finding a seat was kind of tricky - hopefully you get lucky"
1755,,1121,5,10/11/18,"i am currently on a no pork diet, so i was not able to try the new england clam that has bacon already added. but a great alternative was the market clam chowder that includes lobster, crab, and corn  it is some of the best chowder i've had yet "
1756,,1121,5,10/11/18,truly the best new england clam chowder you will ever have. this is a must stop anytime you are near. so good
1757,,1121,4,10/9/18,"i cannot think of a better way of staying warm in rainy seattle than chowder .  i was finally able to make a stop and on waited about  minutes to get through the line.  in total there are  choices of different chowders .  you can order various sizes but if you want to try different one you can choose the sampler.  there a choice of  or  for the sampler and each portion is oz each. we ended up ordering a  chowder sampler with the crab and lobster, crab and oyster, seared scallop, and the new england clam .  all of them were creamy and balanced but i wished there were bigger chunks of the seafood.  my least favorite was the seared scallop chowder , there was a sweet after taste.  also ordered full maine lobster roll.  there was lots of lobster but the sandwich as a whole was a little wet and soggy. it is a little hard finding a seat but the turnover rate is pretty fast, there is also plenty of other seating around pike place."
1758,,1121,3,10/8/18,"i'm giving ppc a solid . stars. during my stay in seattle it was a no-brainer to sample their chowdahhhs in -degree weather. my visit to ppc was on a tuesday. they open at am so i walked by at  am and did not see anyone lined up so i went to go check out beecher's cheese. when i came back to ppc at am there were  people standing in line, but it moved quickly. order your food, pay, and find a table. there is no holding tables allowed unless you have a food tray in hand or else you will get lectured. i ordered the  sampler feast that included  chowders of my choice,  slices of sourdough bread and oyster crackers. original new england clam chowder - solid chowdah, fragrant, nice depth of flavor, ratio of seafood to veggies was lacking.  seafood bisque - least favorite, tomato flavor was overpowering and thick consistency took away from the taste of the seafood cod, salmon, shrimp.  seared scallop chowder - if you are a fan of dill than you will like this. the broth was creamy but light. i did not taste the sear from the scallops and there were not very many. . market chowder daily special - today's special was crab and lobster chowdah - the lightest of all broths. plenty of crab and lobster meat. less depth of flavor not as salty as the original ne clam chowder .  perfect to share for two people to get their chowdahhh on. each serving is  oz. their strawberry lemonade is made fresh. it is not too tart and not overly sweet. great balance grab it from the cooler before you order. the line disappeared after  pm. i would definitely try this place again but would not wait in line or go out of my way. paul's tip across the patio dining area there is public seating where you can horde as many tables as needed. do not forget to check-in on the yelp app to save a  off the  sampler feast"
1759,,1121,5,10/4/18,there is a reason this place has the best chowders .   it was truly amazing.  we tried the regular new england clam chowder and the smoke salmon. both were great although the clam chowder was my fav.   awesome food.  wish they open in new york.
1760,,1121,4,10/4/18,"i got the new england clam chowder , but i did get to try the other chowders as my friends were there with me and got a variety. the new england was the best flavor by far. though the other chowders were not bad, they were not amazing either. i would say the market chowder was the second best, but that changes by the day, so you do not know what you are going to get. the bread bowl was worth it, even though i was way too full to eat any of it it gives the soup a really nice creamy texture that you do not get when it is just in a cup. service is really fast and even though the place feels super small, we found a place to sit fairly easily. however, you can expect the fast service but not particularly polite or good service."
1761,,1121,5,11/5/18,"i got a seafood bisque and a dungeness crab half sandwich and it was as good as the reviews said the bisque was super tasty with a load of different seafood pieces. i tasted crab, shrimp and other seafood . the sandwich was also really good but i do not think the price justified the size. it is like a three inch wide sandwich for i think , it does have a lot of crab and tastes really good so idk i guess it depends on the person. there was a big line, we went on a monday at pm and the line snaked around the front and to the side."
1762,,1121,2,11/3/18,"i thought this place was way overrated. it was decent, but really not worth waiting in line for. we arrived  minutes before opening, so the line went by really quickly and found seats easily. the clam chowder was creamy and hot, but there were too many potatoes and not enough clams. the clam flavor did not really stand out as much as i would have liked either. it was more like a cream soup with a hint of clams. the seafood bisque was a huge disappointment. it was not even lukewarm. it would have been much better if they told us it was not ready rather than serving it cold. i have to have a separate paragraph to address the bread. bread is the best carb medium for hearty soups like this, and to get it wrong on top of mediocre soup was devastating to me. as a native san franciscan, i will admit that perhaps my standards for sourdough are a bit high, but the bread they gave us was all one texture, crust and insides. it was stale, cold, and the sour taste was off putting. tldr the chowder here is mediocre but not worth the wait or the price. the bread is bad and the soup may not be hot enough.  unfortunately, we did not try any other chowders here in seattle, so i cannot really compare it to anything else local."
1763,,1121,4,11/1/18,skip the new england and go for the seafood bisque  i had both and the bisque was light years better. i visited on a wednesday afternoon in october and there was no line. if i would have waited for hours i would have been disappointed. that is the reason for the stars.
1764,,1121,5,11/1/18,"yummy, yummy in my tummy if you are on vacay in seattle, this is a  mandatory stop. most fun staff and best chowder hands down. we laughed the whole time we waited watching their antics. line moves fast so do not let it deter you from the incredible edibles at the end. reasonable pricing, plenty of warm bread they even have extra for free if you ask. small seating area but you can take your chowder anywhere in the market to chow down. we opted for the sampler so we got to try four different flavors. it was awesome. i think they were all amazing but the one that really hit home was the seafood bisque . you can mix and match any ones that you want. tip buy the chowder in a cup and use the extra bread. saves having to buy the chowder in the bread bowl to get your carb hit.if the seating is full, take it to the extra seating at the market."
1765,,1121,4,11/1/18,"it is been a few years since my last seattle visit, so i had to stop by pike place chowder. there is now a constant line down the alley for this place, so crazy but i'm happy to say that it is worth the wait. the quality has not changed, and there are more chowder options. my top favorite chowders were -new england classic -seared scallop so buttery - seafood bisque -clam & oyster pro-tip wait in line before it opens in the morning or order takeout"
1766,,1121,5,10/29/18,"after researching the best spot for chowder in the city, i kept stumbling upon pike place chowder. it is tucked in the side of the alley about one block away from pike place market next to rachel's ginger beer. the line was quite extensive and had a gap in between pizza bar and made in washington. however, the line moves super quickly and your good is ready almost instantaneously. we were one of hundreds who asked the line attendant for a recommendation and he was very happy to answer with the seafood bisque as his favorite soup offering. we of course ordered it in the sourdough bread bowl and it had lots of fresh flaky salmon, oregon shrimp, cod, crab and shrimp. to say it was tasty does not do it justice it is absolutely worth the wait. the seating is crowded, but it was raining surprise and there were empty tables right outside that were covered and dry. make sure you do not miss out on pike place chowder on your next stop to seattle oh, and it was under "
1767,,1121,4,10/28/18,"pretty awesome clam chowder. i would not necessarily rank it the best but it was very good. we ordered the original new england clam chowder and the seafood bisque . both of them were packed with loads of clams and potatoes and the sourdough bread bowl had the crusty exterior and airy, soft interior which was perfection. i felt that both soups were a bit salty on its own. we had to drink lots of water and pretty much ate all the bread that came along with it to balance the saltiness. this place is an iconic location so beware the line will be very very long and seating is very limited. i would recommend one person wait in line while the other scout out for seating. nevertheless, the service is fairly quick so do not be discouraged by the long line."
1768,,1121,5,10/27/18,welcome to chowder heaven. my friends and i waited almost an hour in a congested hallway for a chance to eat some of the best tasting chowder i have ever come across. we elected to get the  chowder sampler and the seafood bisque and manhattan chowders were standouts in particular for me. they even include a heaping helping of phenomenal sourdough bread that paired incredibly with the chowder. i will be sure to stop by here everytime i am in the seattle area
1769,,1121,4,10/27/18,"ok you all, this chowder lives up to the hype. i was recently in seattle for a week and came here twice. and i'm lactose intolerant. the chowder is that good. definitely give the sampler platter a shot so you can try a bunch of chowders - my husband and i shared the scallop chowder far and away my fave, and i do not even like dill, the smoked salmon chowder, seafood bisque , and the market chowder. the accompanying sourdough bread was fresh, warm, and crusty. we also split a dungeness crab roll connecticut style for being on the pricy side, i was a bit underwhelmed could be that i'm a born and bred marylander and am loyal to my blue crabs, or that i wanted this to be more like a lobster roll."
1770,,1121,5,10/23/18,"this place is chowder paradise there are so many options and varieties of chowder we ordered and shared a quart of new england clam chowder, manhattan clam chowder and seafood bisque chowder. slices of sourdough bread were included with the soup and there were extra slices that are up for grabs by the utensils area. tip- lines are super long but it moves fast. if you just want to order soup, order thru their website and just walk up to their mobile ordering pickup booth."
1771,,1121,5,10/23/18,"came here when we were in town for a close friend's wedding. it was amazing we got the clam chowder and seafood bisque . flavorful, creamy, filling, what more could you ask for.maybe some more seating, but no biggie. pro-tip order online, go to the pick-up window and find a random place to sit it is not too hard to find a place with a good view at pike place. definitely saved an hour by doing that."
1772,,1121,5,10/22/18,"food delicious with enough variation to please everyone. pricing surprisingly fair. service na. self-serve. ambiance pike place market. food the -sampler is the perfect way to taste and compare as many different chowders as possible to see how well this place can handle their seafood and none of the options disappointed. new england chowder creamy and hearty with ample ingredients smoked salmon surprisingly no smoky flavor, but enjoyed the salmon crab & oyster one of the best combinations for a chowder ever seafood bisque  huge chunks of fish that were still flaky seared scallop scallops were cooked and simmered perfectly in that delicious chowder lime & coconut reminds me of a thai curry different from what i expected manhattan chowder not my cup of tea, but had a great flavor profile market chowder that day, this was a crab & clam chowder that was very similar to the crab & oyster pricing given the demand, this place does not charge as high as they probably can for their chowders. moreover, a oz. serving per cup of soup may seem small, but given the hearty nature of chowders and liberal amount of ingredients, a meal here will not leave you wanting more. service mostly self-serve with someone coming by occasionally to clean up after messy patrons who never learned to clean up after themselves, but i also want to applaud how fast the servers were at pushing orders through and the host who was passing out the menu pamphlets and giving short reviews on the different chowders. ambiance the restaurant is situated in a cobblestone alleyway like the rest of the pike place market with all outdoor seating that is below the capacity of how many people come frequent so expect to share tables. out of consideration for other restaurants in the area, management also asks customers to not bring their chowder to other establishments."
1773,,1121,5,10/21/18,"do not understand why someone reared it lower for bad service for a  min wait, service has nothing to do with it.  you walk up, order, pay and take your delicious chowder, rolls andor salad.  the wait has to do with the demand.  you do not want to wait, either order ahead online or do not wait in line, go somewhere else. i got the x sampler - scallop chowder favorite, seafood bisque wait, maybe this was my favorite, traditionalnew england clam chowder very good, and manhattan style clam chowder way too tomatoey for my taste and split the original dungeness crab roll, which was also very tasty."
1774,,1121,5,10/21/18,"my wife & i had the seafood bisque and it was delicious. very rich and flavorful with lots of seafood . we arrived about pm on saturday close  and there was a pretty long line. we were told about a  minute wait, but it was a little quicker than that. luckily, they are mostly just putting chowder in bowls. if you can spare the calories it is definitely worth at least a small bowl. we shared a oz bowl, but i could have easily eaten that much myself."
1775,,1121,5,10/20/18,"this place lives up to its hype but expect to wait in line because everyone knows how good this chowder is we ordered the sampler--i highly recommend--a couple of bowls of new england chowder and the seafood bisque omg along with a lobster roll and a crab roll. we added two drinks and they each came with a piece of excellent sourdough bread and crackers if you want them. my favorites were the scallop chowder and the seafood bisque but, honestly, you cannot choose a bad one. our total bill was over  for lunch but every single one of our party of four was in heaven."
1776,,1121,3,10/16/18,"this place is super popular.  i went at lunchtime on the weekend and there were two lines out the door.  it took at least  minutes to get to order. i went with the chowder sampler - seafood bisque , new england clam chowder, market chowder crab, lobster, and sweet corn, and seared scallop chowder.  for  for  oz., it is quite a hefty price to pay.  so, i would hope that it was some stellar chowder. well, it was good chowder, but not the best i've ever had.  the seafood bisque did not have enough seafood taste in it.  the market chowder, seared scallop chowder, and new england chowder all tasted pretty much the same.  if it were not for the different meats in them, i would not be able to tell the difference to what i was eating.  ultimately, in my opinion, it is overhyped but, if you are crazy about chowder, then give it a try."
1777,,1121,5,10/15/18,"incredible place to eat, with some of the best chowder i have ever tried. try the seafood bisque the next time you go i would avoid going in the summer months however who wants chowder when it is that hot but also it gets too busy from visitors."
1778,,1121,5,10/14/18,loved the chowder here. it is very creamy and rich in flavor. the lobster and seafood bisque had to my favorite. you can get a small sample for  or . the sourdough bread is no joke is delicious. i will definitely be back for their lobster rolls
1779,,1121,5,10/14/18,"amazing chowder loved all the types. we took the chowder sampler, our favorite was the seafood bisque and the scallop chowder."
1780,,1121,5,10/13/18,"if you love clam chowder, this is definitely the place to go. my husband and i went on a mini honeymoon to seattle and this place was on the top of my list to try. trust me, it will not disappoint. the lines can get pretty long, though. but i would say it is well worth the wait. my husband and i got lucky though, we went at off times around . so we missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner rush. please note that they have two locations, the super popular one near pike place market that is on  post alley. and the other location is a couple blocks up the street at pacific place center. both locations are equally delicious. so if it is too crowded at the post alley location, i would try the pacific place center. depending on the time it might be slightly less crowded. the first time we went to the post alley location. we ordered half of the original dungeness crab roll and half of the maine lobster roll. both were excellent. both crab and lobster were so fresh. we also ordered of course, the new england clam chowder in the sourdough bowl and the seafood bisque . again, both were excellent and most importantly, they do not skimp on the seafood . as for which is better for the sandwiches, i think it just depends which you like better, crab or lobster. as for the soups, it also depends if you like a tomato based broth or not. if you do the seafood bisque is awesome. i actually could not decide which soup i liked more. that is why when my husband and i ate there a second time. we ordered both the chowder and the bisque again. as for the rolls, my husband preferred the lobster roll, so we just got a whole lobster roll instead of a half. if you do decide to go here, i would advise trying what we got. they also offer a sampler platter of the soups if you really cannot decide what to get. i will definitely come back when i visit seattle."
1781,,1121,4,10/27/18,"ok you all, this chowder lives up to the hype. i was recently in seattle for a week and came here twice. and i'm lactose intolerant. the chowder is that good. definitely give the sampler platter a shot so you can try a bunch of chowders - my husband and i shared the scallop chowder far and away my fave, and i do not even like dill, the smoked salmon chowder, seafood bisque, and the market chowder. the accompanying sourdough bread was fresh, warm, and crusty. we also split a dungeness crab roll connecticut style for being on the pricy side, i was a bit underwhelmed could be that i'm a born and bred marylander and am loyal to my blue crabs , or that i wanted this to be more like a lobster roll ."

1784,,1121,4,10/12/18,"if you are ok with waiting for awhile during peak times, try this spot the seafood bisque and new england clam chowder were delicious and i would definitely have those again. the half-order dungeness crab roll was underwhelming in size and taste, but otherwise our overall experience was positive. finding a seat was kind of tricky - hopefully you get lucky"
1785,,1121,5,10/3/18,"had the soup sampler and dungeness crab roll . soup samples consisted of new england clam chowder, scallop chowder, seafood bisque, and lobster, crab and corn chowder. every one of them was delicious it was hard to even pick a favorite. the crab roll was full of so much crab  only downside was the bottom of the little boat they serve it in was full of the dressing, making the perfectly toasted bun soggy on the bottom. there was quite a long line but it moves very quickly. i imagine the line is even longer on the weekends, so i would definitely recommend stopping here on a weekday it was a perfect rainy day fall lunch"
1786,,1121,5,9/25/18,we skated by probably minutes before this place closed and what luck i ordered the dungeness crab roll with a cup of chowder - my mouth waters just recalling. the crab inside of the roll is fresh. while it lists mayo as an ingredient i hardly tasted it or observed it the crab was perfectly seasoned and had splash of lemon that made it very fresh and light. the chowder- oh the chowder- was packed with flavor and clams the potatoes were perfectly cut into small cubes and overall it was just amazing. will definitely be returning and would highly recommend
1787,,1121,5,9/9/18,"this place was awesome we had the  sampler extravaganza so we can try everything, new england clam chowder and market chowder in the bread bowl,  main lobster roll , and dungeness crab roll . everything was extra good and yummy we were stuffed will def go back"
1788,,1121,5,9/1/18,"this place only does a few things, but as the name suggests, they do them exceedingly well. we had the ne clam chowder, seared scallop chowder, and the original dungeness crab roll .  chowders were outstanding creamy chunky and very well balanced in flavor.   the crab roll was packed full, juicy, and definitely not short on crab .  we were at pike place so had to deal with a line, but to their credit, it moved relatively quickly. pro tip if you only want chowder, grab a menu and your phone, order online and you can skip to the front."
1789,,1121,5,8/19/18,"if you turn the corner into and notice a line coming out of post alley, it is probably for pike place chowder we recently stopped by for lunch and shared the following dishes  sampler extravaganza - if you are not sure which chowder to get, this is a great place to start off it gives you a small sampler cup of all their chowder flavors. we enjoyed the seafood bisque the most. the manhattan style chowder was a bit too sour in our opinion. the lime & coconut chowder almost tasted like a thai green curry without the rice of course. i wish they had signs for all the chowder flavors for each cup but i guess it made the experience more fun. grab a menu and you can try to guess the different flavors as you taste the different chowders connecticut-style dungeness crab roll - we loved this dish so much we ordered two rolls  this was by far one of the best crab rolls i've had. it was loaded with fresh crab meat served on perfectly buttered brioche buns. i would come back for this roll alone if you order through their app, you can skip the line and get the chowders to go we considered doing that but noticed they only offer the -sampler feast  chowders option instead of the -sampler. the app also does not include their seafood rolls . in terms of seating, they have limited seating areas and chances are if you are eating in you might not have a table to sit at."
1790,,1121,5,8/16/18,"best chowder ever. i love the new england clam chowder and the smoked salmon chowder- they are both well-seasoned and fresh. also recommend the dungeness crab roll . the line is often ridiculously long, so it is best to stop by at a time or day less popular for tourists. you can also order online for takeout in order to skip the wait, so that may be a better option for busy days. the service is friendly and quick"
1791,,1121,5,8/11/18,"my husband read online about this place - so we went.  we had a little trouble finding it, but a lovely lady led us to it. look for the sur la table and walk to the alley on the right there was a line. we waited and it went smoothly. it was almost  degrees and sunny, in the rain it would have been miserable. they had water set up, they also had a window set up if you ordered online. when we got our turn i ordered the seafood bisque. i mentioned the bisque. it was absolutely amazing. best chowder in my life. granted i'm from nc, we are not known for our chowder.  a perfect blend of cod, salmon, shrimp and crab with the right spices. perfect on all sides. i considered licking the bowl.  my husband tried the market chowder which had corn, crab and lobster.  we were full from chowder and bread that we almost did not need the dungeness crab roll .but it was delicious too. it was pricey for a wait in line place, tables were hard to come by but i would do it again in a skinny minute.  if you like seafood and chowder, you will love this place.  we will be placing an online order once it gets a little cooler."
1792,,1121,5,7/24/18,"trust me believe the hype about this place after waiting in about a -minute line i had the privilege of ordering a couple bowls of the best chowder i have ever tasted. i went with the smoked salmon chowder and the new england clam chowder which is there classic recipe. on the side i got a half original dungeness crab roll which was delicious and you can tell the crab was extremely fresh. out of the two chowder's i preferred the original new england clam chowder as it was rich and decadent with every ingredient really shining through with each bite. it is a bit on the pricey side but worth every penny, do not leave seattle without trying this place."
1793,,1121,4,7/23/18,"i felt like this place was a little overrated. in order to have a convenient experience you need to do the following things . get there about - minutes before opening time. . save a spot that has actual shade. we ordered a new england clam chowder in bread bowl, dungeness crab roll , and a chowder platter. the clam chowder was super good, it was creamy, the potatoes were soaked in the sauce and burst flavor. the crab roll was refreshing at you got a very good taste of fresh crab in your dish. although some of my family did not like the chowder platter, we agreed that it was a good experience after a  minute wait in line. everything was very good except for the bread. do not get that bread bowl, get a regular bowl and save money. do get the extra bread they set out of their bread bowls, for free"
1794,,1121,4,7/20/18,"the connecticut dungeness crab roll was great - a little too much butter though never thought i would say that about anything.  we also tried the clam chowder and a daily special lobster & crab corn chowder.  everything was delicious, the staff was friendly and the food was served quickly.  the downside is we had a  minute wait in line to place our order  the crab rolls were also on the pricey side  plus tax.  all in all a good experience - just not quite -star."
1795,,1121,5,7/18/18,"great place, a must in seattle. best clam chowder, it has won several awards in straight years. fresh lobster and dungeness crab rolls . the line is a bit long, but worth it"
1796,,1121,5,7/17/18,"most amazing dungeness crab rolls . would order this every day if i could chowder is also delicious and worth having we had the market chowder of the day, which was sweet corn and lobster. my husband and i walked by around am on a tuesday and saw that there were no lines since they open at  am, so we walked around to pass time. by around am,  we found ourselves waiting in the second line, but once pike place chowder opened up, the line went by pretty quickly."
1797,,1121,4,7/10/18,i got two half rolls of the maine lobster roll and original dungeness crab roll and they were very delicious they also had a great selection of chowders. my wait time was approximately  minutes to order. i was kind of disappointed with the lack of space to dine in.
1798,,1121,1,7/1/18,"the food was not worth it. do not get the dungeness crab roll , unfortunately it was bland and overpowered by the seasoning. we got the half, it cost  and was small enough to eat in a couple bites. the seafood bisque was redeeming, but was on the salty side."
1799,,1121,4,6/16/18,"i really like the chowder and dungeness crab roll , flavorful it seems a bit overpriced though."
1800,,1121,4,6/14/18,"we ordered the clam chowder and the market chowder happened to be crab and lobster chowder and they were both phenomenal. the clam chowder was the best i've ever had we also got the dungeness crab roll , which i was not too fond of. overall i would definitely recommend the restaurant"
1801,,1121,4,10/27/18,"ok you all, this chowder lives up to the hype. i was recently in seattle for a week and came here twice. and i'm lactose intolerant. the chowder is that good. definitely give the sampler platter a shot so you can try a bunch of chowders - my husband and i shared the scallop chowder far and away my fave, and i do not even like dill, the smoked salmon chowder , seafood bisque, and the market chowder . the accompanying sourdough bread was fresh, warm, and crusty. we also split a dungeness crab roll connecticut style for being on the pricy side, i was a bit underwhelmed could be that i'm a born and bred marylander and am loyal to my blue crabs, or that i wanted this to be more like a lobster roll."
1802,,1121,4,10/24/18,"crab roll was addicting to eat. market chowder lobster, crab in sweet corn base chowder  was really great. smoked salmon chowder was good but strong, so would only recommend to people who really love that smokey flavor. all of it was delicious"
1803,,1121,5,10/20/18,"get the new england clam chowder . we got the  bowl sampler new england clam chowder smoked salmon chowder market chowder crab, lobster, corn crab & oyster of the , we loved the new england clam chowder . the one we liked the least was the smoked salmon . i tried the new england clam chowder last and wow it blew the other  out of the water. no wonder these guys have so many awards. we went around lunchtime but got lucky as the line was short. even then, the line moved pretty quickly. our  bowl sampler came with slices of sourdough which was really just perfect for us. something about watching people order the chowder in a bread bowl and then proceed to discard the bread bowl when they are done just hurts. disclaimer, the  bowls are pretty small. they have the  bowl sampler as well. be sure to obey the table rules. and also look for the mat on the ground that says to keep clear. you will be doing everyone a favor."
1804,,1121,5,9/14/18,lived up the the hype and worth the  minute wait in line.  definitely recommend the classic new england chowder and the smoked salmon chowder .
1805,,1121,5,9/10/18,"hands down the best chowder i've ever had i walked up to pike place chowder at pm on a monday. i almost turned away because of the line. boy, were my taste buds happy i did not. the line moved quickly due to the efficiency of the employees. every one was friendly and helpful. they had a variety of chowders and seafood sandwich rolls to choose from. i ordered a medium smoked salmon chowder which came with a slice of sourdough bread for about . what a deal it was delicious. smoked salmon , capers, potatoes, in a cream cheese broth. there were baskets of complimentary oyster crackers as well. for me, the medium size was perfect to fill my hungry tummy. even though the restaurant was packed, there always seemed to be a place to sit once you were handed your chowder . i took a seat at the counter and watched as the employees genuinely greeted each and every customer. i usually try to avoid touristy places, however this is a definite must-go. cannot wait to come back and try the chowder sampler  four oz chowders . bravo"
1806,,1121,5,9/7/18,"get the smoked salmon chowder  it is a must try if in seattle. the line is always long, but it moves super quick. i had the - chowder sampler, and out of the four i tried clam, oyster, market, smoked salmon , the smoked salmon was by far the best. do not forget to throw some oyster crackers in there"
1807,,1121,5,9/4/18,"i loved visiting this location. friendly staff, and even better food. their buttered lobster roll was to die for, and the smoked salmon chowder was great. i would have liked to get ginger beer next store before ordering . i will do that next time."
1808,,1121,5,9/3/18,"ah definitely a must go. no wonder the hype. fyi we had about  parties before us, and it only took us about a  minute wait time. not bad at all and so worth it we ordered the  sampler so we got to try all the chowders . the original clam chowder was definitely our favorite, followed by the special for that day lobster and oyster with sweet corn. i also really liked the smoked salmon chowder - very smoky the lime and coconut chowder was good too though i did not taste lime or coconut, haha. great vegan option and so glad they have it available. they give bread slices with the chowders and they also have an extra bread section that has all the inside chunks hulled out of the sourdough bread bowls - best part of bread it is like a dream come true haha."
1809,,1121,5,8/30/18,"really enjoyed the lobster & crab corn chowder bread bowl, along with new england clam chowder bread bowl. plan on trying the smoked salmon chowder when we return"
1810,,1121,5,8/21/18,"best. clam. chowder . i've. ever. tasted. we visited this place while exploring seattle at pike place market as we heard they had award winning clam chowder  and let me just say that i am not surprised that pike place chowder had won so many awards in the past. we went on a tuesday around noon and the line wrapped along the edge of the building, down the alleyway, and almost reached the street however, the line moved fairly quickly and it took about  minutes to get to front to order. struggling with trying to decide what to order, we decided to go with the sampler to allow us to try three types of chowder ---new england, seared scallop, and the smoked salmon chowder as well as the lobster roll. all three chowders were very creamy and contained a good amount of clams if you are very sensitive to seafood being fishy, i would not recommend the smoked salmon chowder as that ended up being more on the fishy side. the lobster roll was fresh and yummy it was pricey but worth the experience and expected for clam chowder of such great taste and quality tip if you love bread, they leave a tray of extra torn bread on a shelf that you can grab for free so that you can dip it in your chowders  they also have oyster crackers."
1811,,1121,5,8/21/18,"this was delicious definitely within my top  chowders . my girlfriend and i ordered a medium smoked salmon chowder and a large market chowder , which was a crab & lobster corn chowder for the day. each chowder comes with a slice of sourdough that had a nice tang to it especially with the creaminess of the soup. looking back, a small is probably the best size to order if you want to hit all the touristy spots, but the chowder itself is great enough to warrant the bread bowl or an xl definitely want to come back the next time i'm in seattle"
1812,,1121,5,8/19/18,well worth the  minutes wait on sunday afternoon. opted for a bread bowl smoked salmon chowder and was not disappointed.
1813,,1121,5,8/17/18,"we ordered the  sampler new england clam chowder , scallop chowder , scallop & clam chowder and smoked salmon chowder . they were just as expected creamy, rich, and super flavorful. however, neither one of us liked the smoked salmon . slices of sourdough come with it and extra sourdough are available at the top shelf near the cutleries. my sister tried the lobster roll last time she went and she said it was eh. overall, the food was good and it is for sure a must try. but i'm not quite sure if i would come back for more. it seems more like a tourist attraction and you are there for the experience really."
1814,,1121,5,8/16/18,"best chowder ever. i love the new england clam chowder and the smoked salmon chowder - they are both well-seasoned and fresh. also recommend the dungeness crab roll. the line is often ridiculously long, so it is best to stop by at a time or day less popular for tourists. you can also order online for takeout in order to skip the wait, so that may be a better option for busy days. the service is friendly and quick"
1815,,1121,5,8/13/18,"cannot say i've had better chowders anywhere else. but then again, i'm used to getting mediocre chowder from chain restaurants *cringe*. i hate to share this tip because everyone else who already knew will hate me but order ahead online. if you do so, you can set a pick up time, pick up without standing in the line, and head straight to a much coveted table outside in the beautiful summer weather. i'm a bad yelper - we ordered the sampler but did not redeem the  off with yelp checkin. oops. do not forget to do that although, not sure if that is a temporary promotion. we also got an additional regular sized bowl of chowder to try. the sampler was so delicious since i'm so indecisive. it was easier just to try a smaller amount of a few different kinds of chowder . every chowder we tried was chunky and did not skimp on the seafood ingredients. we ordered the fan favorites - the new england, the manhattan, the smoked salmon , the seared scallop and the crab and oyster. you cannot go wrong with the classic new england clam chowder . we also tried the smoked salmon chowder , which tasted unmistakably like. smoked salmon . the manhattan style was not bad, although many may beg to differ. i do enjoy a good tomato based soup, so this was pretty tasty. the seared scallop and crab and oyster were not too memorable to me, but are always worth a try, especially if you are getting the sampler. overall, a must-visit at the pike place market"
1816,,1121,5,8/13/18,"sadly, i'm allergic to shellfish but boy is their smoked salmon chowder good or is it good . busy touristy vibe but then this place is a religion so cannot really blame the perpetual line. if in a hurry, order online n pick at the take-away window"
1817,,1121,2,8/5/18,"after hearing and seeing about this world famous chowder spot online, we figured we had to come try it. our family loves chowder - when it is good - so we hoped for this to really blow us away. we saw the sampler options and opted for the four-set, since there were really only four of the  or  options available that we wanted to try. the four we chose were the new england, seafood bisque, seared scallop, and smoked salmon . quite frankly, all the chowders except the salmon tasted the same. the smoked salmon chowder had the distinct flavor of the salmon differentiating it from the others, and it was the thickest of the four. the other three were also very soupy, not a thick chowder that we had hoped for. across the board, the chowders were simply decent. nothing bad about any of them, but it seems that they make the chowders in such large batches that it loses the true flavor and essence of each individual chowder . for , even with the sampler, it is also kind of expensive, considering how little chowder you get as opposed to other places giving you much more chowder for less. there is also a pretty ridiculous line at all open hours but it moves rather quick. i really would not recommend this to other tourists or stop by again when i am in seattle again."
1818,,1121,5,7/24/18,"trust me believe the hype about this place after waiting in about a -minute line i had the privilege of ordering a couple bowls of the best chowder i have ever tasted. i went with the smoked salmon chowder and the new england clam chowder which is there classic recipe. on the side i got a half original dungeness crab roll which was delicious and you can tell the crab was extremely fresh. out of the two chowder's i preferred the original new england clam chowder as it was rich and decadent with every ingredient really shining through with each bite. it is a bit on the pricey side but worth every penny, do not leave seattle without trying this place."
1819,,1121,5,7/10/18,"line was a little long pretty much every time i walked past this place, so pro-tip . if you just want chowder , order it online for pick up and just eat at the public tables across the way. the tables right next to the chowder place have signs that say for dine-in customers only, not pick-up customers. we wanted the full experience so waited in the line for about a half hour, but the line moved quickly the prices were a little higher than i expected, but you get quality seafood in your chowder  their fresh-squeezed lemonade was also a great addition to our meal on a hot summer afternoon. i wanted to try a lot of different flavors, so i shared the  chowder sampler  off with yelp check-in and one medium new england clam chowder . the new england was easily my favorite. not surprising because it won a bajillion awards and contests the serving had plenty of huge clams, and was very rich and creamy. they give bread with the chowder , but i liked the oyster crackers with it better. for the sampler, i got the seafood bisque, smoked salmon chowder , crab and oyster chowder , and that day's special which had crab and lobster. i preferred the creamy chowders to the more tomato-based options. it was nice to try most of their chowder options, but if i ever return to seattle, i will probably just get the new england"
1820,,1121,5,7/3/18,"the food here is excellent.  the line to order is extremely long, but a staff member suggested we order online.  within  minutes of ordering online our food was ready and we did not have to wait in a line to pick up order. smoked salmon chowder in a bread bowl was fantastic."
1821,,1121,3,10/16/18,"this place is super popular.  i went at lunchtime on the weekend and there were two lines out the door.  it took at least  minutes to get to order. i went with the chowder sampler - seafood bisque, new england clam chowder , market chowder crab, lobster, and sweet corn, and seared scallop chowder .  for  for  oz., it is quite a hefty price to pay.  so, i would hope that it was some stellar chowder . well, it was good chowder , but not the best i've ever had.  the seafood bisque did not have enough seafood taste in it.  the market chowder , seared scallop chowder , and new england chowder all tasted pretty much the same.  if it were not for the different meats in them, i would not be able to tell the difference to what i was eating.  ultimately, in my opinion, it is overhyped but, if you are crazy about chowder , then give it a try."
1822,,1121,4,10/9/18,"i cannot think of a better way of staying warm in rainy seattle than chowder .  i was finally able to make a stop and on waited about  minutes to get through the line.  in total there are  choices of different chowders .  you can order various sizes but if you want to try different one you can choose the sampler.  there a choice of  or  for the sampler and each portion is oz each. we ended up ordering a  chowder sampler with the crab and lobster, crab and oyster, seared scallop , and the new england clam.  all of them were creamy and balanced but i wished there were bigger chunks of the seafood.  my least favorite was the seared scallop chowder , there was a sweet after taste.  also ordered full maine lobster roll.  there was lots of lobster but the sandwich as a whole was a little wet and soggy. it is a little hard finding a seat but the turnover rate is pretty fast, there is also plenty of other seating around pike place."
1823,,1121,3,10/8/18,"i'm giving ppc a solid . stars. during my stay in seattle it was a no-brainer to sample their chowdahhhs in -degree weather. my visit to ppc was on a tuesday. they open at am so i walked by at  am and did not see anyone lined up so i went to go check out beecher's cheese. when i came back to ppc at am there were  people standing in line, but it moved quickly. order your food, pay, and find a table. there is no holding tables allowed unless you have a food tray in hand or else you will get lectured. i ordered the  sampler feast that included  chowders of my choice,  slices of sourdough bread and oyster crackers. original new england clam chowder - solid chowdah, fragrant, nice depth of flavor, ratio of seafood to veggies was lacking.  seafood bisque - least favorite, tomato flavor was overpowering and thick consistency took away from the taste of the seafood cod, salmon, shrimp.  seared scallop chowder - if you are a fan of dill than you will like this. the broth was creamy but light. i did not taste the sear from the scallops and there were not very many. . market chowder daily special - today's special was crab and lobster chowdah - the lightest of all broths. plenty of crab and lobster meat. less depth of flavor not as salty as the original ne clam chowder .  perfect to share for two people to get their chowdahhh on. each serving is  oz. their strawberry lemonade is made fresh. it is not too tart and not overly sweet. great balance grab it from the cooler before you order. the line disappeared after  pm. i would definitely try this place again but would not wait in line or go out of my way. paul's tip across the patio dining area there is public seating where you can horde as many tables as needed. do not forget to check-in on the yelp app to save a  off the  sampler feast"
1824,,1121,5,9/22/18,"seared scallop chowder is my new favorite meal this place was awesome line was long that is a good sign right but it goes fairly quickly. absolutely the best chowder i've ever had. if you cannot decide what you want you can get a flight if chowders which is pretty awesome. we were there late and they gave us some bread with a light coating of cheese on it since it was going to be tossed anyways. it was delicious but i do not know what it was called, sorry. this is a must stop if you are in the pike place market area"
1825,,1121,5,9/19/18,"you can never go wrong with the sampler if you have an adventurous taste buds. i personally enjoyed the southern chicken & corn chowder and the seared scallop chowder .  if you see a long line of people, do not fret. their award-winning selection of chowders are definitely crowd pleasers."
1826,,1121,5,9/1/18,"this place only does a few things, but as the name suggests, they do them exceedingly well. we had the ne clam chowder , seared scallop chowder , and the original dungeness crab roll. chowders were outstanding creamy chunky and very well balanced in flavor.   the crab roll was packed full, juicy, and definitely not short on crab.  we were at pike place so had to deal with a line, but to their credit, it moved relatively quickly. pro tip if you only want chowder , grab a menu and your phone, order online and you can skip to the front."
1827,,1121,5,7/30/18,"clam chowder is my all time favorite soup, and this is the best chowder i've ever had in my life. i came to line up at the store with my friend  mins before it opened and there was already a really long line. i got the  cup chowder sampler all for myself, and it was the best purchase i made on my seattle trip. i tried the new england clam chowder , market chowder , seared scallop chowder , and seafood bisque. all of them were absolutely amazing, but the new england one was my favorite. if you are going to only try one, try that one. i still dream about this chowder , so please go and give this place a try if you are in the area."
1828,,1121,4,7/13/18,"aug.  -     rating.new england clam chowder .very good, but better to be found at wally's in des moines. lobster roll. disappointed two of the three of us, and at . for half of an already small sandwich loaded with fillers, it should be avoided. seared scallop chowder .really well done with large chunks of scallop . long line to get in, but it moved quickly. our expectations were very high because of all the hype this place receives. that may be why the three of us were slightly underwhelmed. tip if you want to  avoid the long line, call in a take-out order and bypass the wait. wish we had."
1829,,1121,5,6/30/18,the best chowder anywhere i highly recommend the seafood bisque and seared scallop chowder . the - or - chowder samplers are perfect to try them.
1830,,1121,4,6/16/18,"my friend told me this is a must try place since i love clam chowder , she was right she told me to get the sampler so i could try more than one chowder . i listened to her, lol. everything looked sooo good. i ordered the smoked salmon chowder , seared scallop chowder , market chowder and the crab, oyster and chorizo chowder . they were all good, but my favs were the smoked salmon and the market chowder . the smoked salmon was not overpowering the chowder and it was not at all fishy taste either. the market chowder was simple, but a good simple. the seared scallop sadly was too liquidy for me. the crab, oyster and chorizo was good, but did not hit that must get again feeling. we also ordered the captain's roll. it has shrimp and crab meat. that was good, but not enough filling and more bread than what i would have liked. to me it was not worth the price of the whole size. which was close to . i would take half a star off for that. the line was long, but the wait time was not. the line wrapped around the corner inside, but we only waited maybe  mins it was not super long. it gave us enough time to decide on what to order. grab a menu while you are on your way to the end of the line. the service was fast. the guy was. nice, however he could have explained the table rules to us better than he did. i wanted to take my chowders to go, but eat there. i wanted them in a to go style since i probably was not going to finish them all however that would not have come with a tray and you must have your food on a tray in order to sit at a table. okay. but he did not explain it like that. he was just like you could have it to go, but you might get kicked off a table for not having a tray. which left me confused. if he added oh we have these table rules thing. then yeah okay sure, i get it. but nope. it rubbed me the wrong way, sadly to where i had to mention it here and to take off half a star for. i'm all about the little thingsdetails. maybe i was just hangry too. idk. overall, i would still recommend coming here. their chowder is pretty darn good not to try and i would be back for sure."
1831,,1121,4,6/14/18,"we ordered every meat chowder on the menu i loved the crab & oyster and the seared scallop chowders . the seafood bisque was also good i did not super like the clam chowder but i also do not like bacon and my husband loved it so take my opinion with a grain of salt. i also did not love the smoked salmon chowder it is the only one we did not finish just because it was a little too rich for our taste but it definitely was not bad. generally, there is an awkward atmosphere. the employees are trying to be nice about their policies but even as people who followed the rules and all of the signs, it felt like we were in trouble too i would see someone sit down with a pick up order or before they had gotten their chowder and i would brace myself for someone to run out and yell at them. it is just kind of weird. i guess it is for my benefit but there has got to be a better way to do that. it is super awkward for everyone involved. do not get me wrong the chowder is great. there were just some parts of their customer service that left something to be desired, to no fault of the employees. everyone we spoke to directly was kind"
1832,,1121,5,6/13/18,"omg this place is amaze-balls  i ordered the -serving chowder  seared scallop chowder , new england clam chowder , seafood bisque, and corn chowder .  along with that i ordered the full size lobster roll.  my faves were the seafood bisque and lobster roll.   both had awesome flavors and would def have again.   def a place to visit if you like different chowders ."
1833,,1121,5,6/11/18,"pike place chowder was another of my favorite meals at pike place market we came about  minutes before they opened on a sunday and there was already a line forming by the time they opened, there was a line out of the alley down the hill definitely come here early or else you will be stuck in line for a while. i ordered the chowder sampler, which comes with  chowder options of your choice. i went with the new england clam chowder , seafood bisque, market chowder , and seared scallop chowder . you also get some bread and oyster crackers with your order. my favorite was the new england clam chowder , which was perfectly creamy and delicious. the clams were tender and tasted fresh. it was honestly better than most chowders i've had in sf and boston. i also really enjoyed the market chowder , which has varied seafood every day based on what is available. the seafood bisque was delicious as well, with the creamy tomato-based broth. unfortunately, i did not really enjoy the seared scallop chowder because of the overwhelming flavor of dill, which overpowered the creaminess of the chowder and freshness of the seafood. for my visits in the future, i will definitely stick to my favorite, which is the new england clam chowder ."
1834,,1121,5,5/24/18,"be prepared to stand in line for a bit, but it is totally worth it clam chowder and the seared scallop chowder we are both outstanding. dungeness sandwich was pricey for the amount, but really tasty. definitely a place to hit if you are in town"
1835,,1121,5,5/22/18,"the wait time is not as bad as the line looks. it only took us  minutes to wait in line and it came out to us right away as soon as we ordered. it is not as pricey since they give you a lot, including bread and some oysters chips next to the spoons, forks and knives. we got the  cup sampler and instead of the manhattan clam chowder , we got two cups of the new england clam chowder instead. the ones that i got were on the menu that i had posted below this review. my favorite has to be the seared scallop chowder . it was so flavorful and tasted a better than the new england clam chowder . all of the chowders are really delicious and i would definitely recommend others to come here too. i find that their chowder is better than the one you can get in san francisco, ca, because of the great texture and creaminess that you cannot get there. the lime and coconut clam chowder tastes like curry, which is one of my other favorites that i had the opportunity to try today. the other one that i have had have an acquired taste that you will be accustomed to get the sampler and check in so that you can get  off the sampler  for  sample cups are worth it when sharing with another person, you will not regret it. the overall atmosphere is nice and everyone is really great to talk to. customer service was a definitely and i really enjoyed the workers attitudes. you are going to have to wait for a table as there may be people sitting down already. on the table it says that you cannot save a table unless you already have food with you, so be kind and courteous to those who already have their food. will definitely be coming back as much as possible before i leave. i love me some clam chowder "
1836,,1121,4,5/22/18,"do not be scared of the line. it goes by pretty fast and is worth the hype. for  girls we wanted to sample a little bit of everything so we got the -sampler extravaganza  and the original dungeness crab roll. with the  samplers, we were able to try all the chowders they had.  new england clam chowder and market chowder - these two were my favorites. the perfect creaminess and balance of flavor. the market chowder that day was a lobster, crab, and corn creamy dreamy.  seared scallop chowder - the dill in this was overpowering.  manhattan style chowder - when i think of a chowder i think of a thick creamy comforting soup. i would not consider this soup a chowder . it was basically a tomato broth. it was bland and there just was not too much happening. as a group, we agreed that we wish we did not get this one.  original dungeness crab roll - lacking in flavor, needed more mayo because it was dry. would skip and just stick to the chowders"
1837,,1121,5,5/17/18,my boyfriend took me here and the line was not as long as the usual.  we had the new england & seared scallop chowder .  oh my goodness the new england chowder was so delicious.  literally one of the best chowders i have ever eaten.  the seared scallops was good too but a little tooooo fishy in my tastes.
1838,,1121,5,5/17/18,"i have had a lot of chowder in my lifetime and pike place chowder is still my favorite though there are some strong contenders out there. that being said it does have it is downfalls long lines, tough seating, average breadbreadbowl but as far as pure og chowder goes, this one is still the best. first got to try this place when i took a seattle food tour. i was instantly impressed and fell in love. been back to seattle for a few times but for transportation reasons i ended up at the satellite mall location which is nowhere near as good. finally got to come back here on my most recent trip wondering if my memory steered me wrong but nope, this place continues to be the bomb. came on a sunday early afternoon with a friend. line was long but very organized. it ran down the hall but we were determined to stick it out. line moves very quickly and they offer menus midway through the line so you can start thinking about what you want. friend and i decided to share the sampler which was the perfect size for us. we had a bit to eat beforehand at the market but not a full meal and it was lunchtime but the sampler was plenty of food for the both of us though that did not stop us from scraping each bowl clean. there is also a yelp checkin deal for the sampler so you can get a slight discount. every soup has similar characteristics  perfect consistency smooth, not clump, rich but not heavy  good seafood to potato to liquid ratio enough seafood where i get some in every other bite  love the little bit of skin left on the potatoes which really enhances the texture.  a bit salty not in a way that you will notice too much at first but about halfway through you will be reaching for the water. though at the same time if it was any less salty it would be less delicious. every soup also comes w crackers and a loaf of bread. bread is room temp and just fine. it does its job of sopping up the soup. it is a fairly acidic sour dough which is nice too not the best bread i've ever had paired with chowder but we are not here for the bread. for our sampler we got the following also listed in my least to most loved  smoked salmon chowder  this is my least favorite but still tasty. it is probably the saltiest of the . the smokiness is there but i do get a bit tired of it after a while. both the cream cheese and capers are not overpowering. it does not taste like your typical smoked salmoncream cheesecaper combo despite the same ingredients. all of them meld together very cohesively into a flavor all its own. it is also the chowder that had the least amount of actual seafood but it was still a decent amount. .  seafood bisque really close call between this and the scallop chowder for nd place but scallop edged it out by just a bit. really great creamy tomato broth with an amazing herb blend and plenty of seafood. the potato skins worked the best in this one for me. .  seared scallop chowder  my runner up for the chowder championship. even though it looks very similar to the clam chowder the flavors are so different. plenty of sweet scallops and when i first got a bite i was so surprised they were sea scallops and not bay scallops  definitely a huge plus since these were so much meatier and butterier. you can taste the dill in every bite and the lime lifts up the creamy broth. absolutely love this .  clam chowder  forever the winner of my ongoing search for the best chowder of the world. not sure what else can be said. great consistency, plenty of tender clams, and a magical blend of herbs that i wish i knew. get this  overall, it is pretty obvious i love this place to death. yes, sometimes i'm embarrassed to admit my favorite chowder is pike place and not some hole-in-the-wall place i found in all my food adventuring but in the end it is popular for a reason. there is some great chowders out there that offer flavorstexturesetc that pike's does not but when it comes down to it, this is still ultimately my favorite chowder spot."
1839,,1121,4,5/16/18,"we came here last friday based on a strong recommendation. there were so many delicious options to choose from that we settled on the - chowder sampler. this was the way to go. we had the regular clam chowder , the crab and oyster chowder , the manhattan clam chowder , and the seared scallop chowder . the manhattan chowder , while good, was the most underwhelming. the regular chowder and the scallop chowder were amazing - but hands down, we both liked the crab and oyster version the best. this version was full of flavor not only from the seafood, but from the chorizo that is part of this magic concoction. the slight saltiness and spiciness combined to produce a stronger flavor than the other three selections. maybe it is because my culture loves their spicy food this was not that spicy but it was flavorful, and maybe because my lady loves her spicy food as well that we liked it the best. i would recommend any of what we tried as a single choice, but for me, the crab and oysters hit the mark. when you come here, be ready for a line and awkward seating. the restaurant gets congested, but it is packed with people who know where to come for amazing chowder ."
1840,,1121,5,5/5/18,"yes, definitely come here. some other places in seattle have a lot of reviews, but are very bland. however, this place % meets its expectations. food simply amazing. i love clam chowder . it was super cold when my friends and i came here so it was perfect. we ordered the sampler, since we knew we would be eating a lot for the rest of the day. the new england clam chowder was the best, hands down. it was extremely rich. i could not get enough of it. if i had known, i would have replaced % of my meals in seattle to get more of this clam chowder . my second favorite was the crab and oyster chowder . the crab and the oyster tasted very fresh, and again it was also very rich. the seared scallop chowder was on the sweeter side. it did not taste like a normal  chowder  which was a nice change of flavor from the others. my least favorite was the seafood bisque. it was not like chowder really and the flavor was a bit off. i only had a few spoonfuls of the seafood bisque since i did not enjoy it at all. wait the line looked so long. we kept walking to the end of the line and it seemed like there would be no end to it, but once we got in line we waited maybe  mins max. service the worker in front of the line who was letting everyone in was really nice. he made a few jokes here and there. once you get past him, you get your clam chowder almost immediately."
1841,,1123,5,8/26/18,"love coming here for hand crafted drinks.  bartender knows his whiskey and the food menu features the same classics it did  years ago, including boar sloppy joe's. located in the vibrant center of capital hill. parking is limited on streets."
1842,,1123,4,6/2/18,"this little gastropub has been on my radar for quite some time, and i've finally had the chance to get around to trying it located within the heart of capitol hill's pikepine strip, this is a surprisingly cozy little spot that feels relaxingrustic and somewhat tucked away from all the nearby action just outside. the menu boasts lots of dishes with unique ingredients  wild boar sloppy joes , duck eggs, foie gras, etc., and an impressive selection of cocktails in addition to good winebeer choices - but there is also some more simple fare too, if so desired for those looking for something quite extravagant and delicious and a bit spendy, fyi - but it is enough food to share, you can come here to take on the ultra burger - which adds a duck egg, foie gras, and more to the already indulgent standard burger, and the fries get an upgrade to a variation on poutine melted cheese instead of curds. i had to see what all the fuss was about on this one one bite in, and i was instantly treated to some culinary excellence i must say that quinn's really knows how to make specialized ingredients shine in a rather approachable way seriously, why are not duck eggs more popular. i also love that you can get a proper medium-rare burger patty here - which is somewhat of a rarity, sadly additionally, i will say i had great service for my first visit here. overall, this is a great little spot with some unique dishes in a cool, casual setting. i look forward to coming back and trying more things"
1843,,1123,4,4/20/18,"i've been here  or  times and figured i should finally leave a review. initially, the big draw for me was the wild boar sloppy joe which comes on a brioche bun and a sunny side up duck egg. the flavor combination is out of this world and that is saying a lot for a sloppy joe . recently had a few cocktails from here and the bartenders were extremely knowledgeable and helpful when you need a drink tip. fun and chill atmosphere that i recommend for any occasion."
1844,,1123,3,10/11/17,"i wanted to like quinn's because the food pictures were what got us - various meat, foie gras frites, bone marrow and the ultra burger. looks like the ultra burger is no longer on the menu, and if you would like to recreate it yourself, it would cost you a whopping  totally not worth. first disappointment. second disappointment is that the bone marrow had red onion jam - i despise red onion, so we ended up not ordering this dish. we ended up ordering the boar sloppy joe and the regular quinn burger. the fries on the quinn burger order were pretty good, very crisp and well fried. the burger itself was juicy, but lackluster - just your typical burger. we even added a duck egg on it probably would not have tasted as good without it. the sloppy joe meat was surprisingly very dry the ground meat must have been over cooked. as a result, whenever you had super large chunks of it inside, it was pretty tough to chew. the worst part was, when biting into it and expecting juicy sloppy softness, you immediately break your teeth on what appeared to be fried onions aka rocks embedded inside. i had to pick these rocks out before they really chipped my teeth. finally, on flavor, i'm happy with their fried duck egg, but the sloppy joe itself was lackluster and missing a key component which i fixed with adding some pepper to it. the worst part of dinner was the service  star quality the waiter was super rude and responded with attitude when we asked him for menu recommendations - do not be a waiter if you hate your job it was not even crowded - maybe only - tables were filled - so there is not an excuse for being too busy. i personally would not come back to try the poutine foie frites given this first-time experience."
1845,,1123,3,9/30/17,"meh. it was ok. we had dinner here a friday night. drinks, decor and food were unimpressive. the menu seemed so interesting but the dishes failed to deliver. we had the lamb sausage tajine never found a single piece of sausage in the whole dish- we love merguez so we were looking, wild boar sloppy joe decent and short rib agnolotti the pickled element was really off putting in the dish. for dessert pickings were slim. took a scoop of homemade ice cream which was fine but had a weird texture and the chocolate item literally a pre-packaged chocolate bar in foil on a plate. decor was ok but there was an unpleasant smell upstairs where we were sitting. there was no wait which was a plus and the service was good so overall a  star experience."
1846,,1123,5,6/15/17,"quinn's is a solid barrestaurant.  i really like that there is more space here than most capitol hill places.  in a lot of restaurants in the area, i feel really cramped and crowded during busy times.  at quinn's, even when it is full, i do not feel like i'm on top of the other guests because of the high ceilings, number of tables, and -story layout.  it is nice because you have the options to sit at the bar, in the first floor restaurant area, or upstairs which is a little more mellow.  even when there are not a lot of people there, it still maintains a happening atmosphere with good music and outgoing staff members.  my go-to meal is the boar sloppy joe and quinn's own golden ale.  the dish is a bun overflowing with deliciously well-seasoned boar meat sauce, crispy fried onions, and a roasted red chili pepper.  this is great because you can slice off and mash up as much of the pepper to make it spicy to your own taste.  you can also get it with a duck egg, but i think it is perfect as-is.  they are also great about large groups as long as you give them a heads up, and i've always had good service."
1847,,1123,5,12/1/16,came here for dinner our last night in seattle & it was fulfilling  highly recommend trying the  wild boar sloppy joe  it was perfectly satisfying. i wish i would have ordered one to go 
1848,,1123,4,10/15/16,"the wild boar sloppy joe is still my favorite here. roasted bone marrow is really good. they still attract a good crowd. nice ambience of modern, urban pub. fun place with friends. good cocktails and good service."
1849,,1123,3,10/2/16,i had the bone marrow and the boar sloppy joe . the food looked good but the flavors were mild. beer selection and service was good. really nice atmosphere.

1851,,1123,3,7/29/16,"let us start off by saying i would like to give less stars but the only thing that saved it was the food. the service was horrible, act must have been broken or something because it was really hot and smelly the whole time we were there. usually i can get over these things, but that stench was wicked. no idea what it was. but let us get to the good stuff. we ordered the foie gras frites and scotch egg as an appy to get us started. scotch egg was really delicious and the frites were so so. the kicker though, was my entree. it was the only reason i decided to come check this place out. the famous wild boar sloppy joe . i ordered w a duck egg on top and i'm glad i did. it was definitely sloppy  actually had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork lol. probably will not be back for a while but might give it another try one day."
1852,,1123,2,6/30/16,"i was really looking forward to this place after hearing raving reviews from friends after a drunken night. i came here during happy hour and was wildly disappointed. the presentation of the food was pretty and sophisticated but the flavors were lacking. the wild boar sloppy joe came with an over easy duck egg, friend basil, and fried onion strings. overall, it was bland. the foie gras frites were mediocre. the fries were not hot and the foie gras was shaved pate. the clam & mussels came with fried potatoes, garlic, bread crumbs, and a white sauce. it was the best thing we ate but it was overly salted. the cocktail i ordered was called the quincy, named after the restaurant i presume. it could have been stronger but the flavors were good. it came with vodka, lemon, lillet, antica, sugar, and bitters. the food was not impressive and for the price, i will probably not return."
1853,,1123,4,5/31/16,"quinn's has been putting out high quality 'gastropub' fare for a number of years now. it had been much too long since my last visit and it was nice to find out that the quality of the food has not suffered in the slightest. it was a later dinner so we did not order as much as we might otherwise, but my wife ordered a simple bibb lettuce salad, it was lightly dressed and accompanied with a few shavings of cheese and a few pine nuts. very simple, but packed a lot of flavor and would typically be a perfect starter for the table. i went with the old standby favorite, the boar sloppy joe with their frites. the crunchy little onions on the top give it a nice little texture, and the flavor of the boar is divine. it is a little gamey, but not so much that it would be off-putting if you are not used to eating things like venison, goat, or even rabbit. it is a bit messy otherwise you could not really call it a ' sloppy ' joe , and requires a knife and fork to eat it without spilling everything all over your plate, the table, and yourself. their fries smothered in a rich marrow demi-glace and a fonduta cheese is a perfect pairing. call the sandwich a 'large plate' is a bit deceptive, though. it would not really be enough to call it a meal on it is own. it seems like it should come with the fries and if you want to upgrade to a salad that could be a few bucks more. as good as the fries are, i do not think they were really worth . they have a really good beer selection with a nice number of different micro-brews on tap, as well as a terrific looking cocktail list. i stuck with a simple red amber that night and usually i do not care for hoppier beers, but it paired very well with the food to cut through the big flavor of the sandwich. my biggest disappointment with quinn's is that the menu really has not changed much since they opened. while everything on the menu is done very well, i got the impression that they would be cooking seasonally, evolving their items, and instead it is the same basic list of choices even though all of them are extremely well done. for a reasonably priced pub with high end level of traditional fare, it is still hard to beat quinn's, but it is starting to show it is age just a touch."
1854,,1123,5,5/25/16,"my favorite restaurant in capitol hill everything on the menu is delicious and inspiring. i love the bone marrow huge portion of huge bones with perfectly toasted bread, oysters on the half she will, cheese plate, charcuterie plate, and wild boar sloppy joe . they also have good cocktails and great service. the location cannot be beat, and it is usually not horribly crowded. it is pricey but so worth it."
1855,,1123,3,5/9/16,i really like the atmosphere of this place. the foie gras seared is delicious. but i was disappointed with the portions. the small plates are the side of tapas at best. also the menu is extremely small.  % of the stuff people rave about on yelp is not in the menu. the wild boar sloppy joe was the only consistent thing i saw. i would not recommend this place if you have a large appetite.
1856,,1123,4,3/31/16,"hey, you yea, you, the person perusing yelp to figure out where the hell you want to have dinner.  let us make this easier, repeat after me, screw it, let us eat at quinn's,  now put down your phone and prepare for deliciousness. what to order - wild boar sloppy joe  see how many god damn pictures there are of this beast well that should mean that its freaking delicious, so order it. and the optional duck egg not optional but mandatory. slap that bad boy on there.  anthony bourdain recommended it for a reason. - foie gras frites waiting for your food to come out snack on this masterpiece, you sexy bastard, you. a masterpiece of chilled and grated foie gras on a steamy bed of fries, rich cheese curds, and high-blood-pressure-inducing gravy, or whatever fancy name they give it. thirsty wash it all down with your favorite brew, or be adventurous and try something entirely new. they are a pub after all. the rest of the menu looked enticing as well. and did i mention they have happy hour score. hip and intimate atmosphere, accented with dim lighting and the pattering of pacific northwest rain outside. service was meh and left a lot to be desired.  while attentive, servers could do more than just the drop-off-and-go routine. i do not know, maybe i came on an off day. on your way now."
1857,,1123,4,3/17/16,"quinn's still serves one of the best burgers in town. it is just perfectly executed. i'm also a fan of the beef tartare i guess i'm a fan of painted hills beef and the wild boar sloppy joe . service is usually better than you would expect for this part of town and i still dig the somewhat outdated gastro pub feel. i avoid quinn's on weekends as the woo girls seem to take over, but when i'm craving a great burger, i know where to come."
1858,,1123,4,3/4/16,"quinn's was initially a happy surprise. i was trying to find a place in cap hill that served food past pm and this place has since become one of my favorites. ambience is pretty casual though i consider the food to be upscale for late night pub fare. it is pretty dim inside and tables are on the smaller side so great for groups of -, mainly. the beef tartare is a must for me. at , you get exceptional value. other places sometimes miss the mark on tartare lack of seasoning, poor ratios but quinn's has my favorite by far. there is enough bread to last you, an amazing balance of seasoning, and a small frisee salad that keeps things refreshing. the pork belly, foie gras frites, wild boar sloppy joe , and burger are also great selections. just to nitpick, the pork belly does come with very little meat. the plate is fluffed up with squash but let us be real - we want more of the pig. their charcuterie is one of those things you got to try at least once. it consists of mousses, pates, etc. no sliced meats but it is so tasty and fun to try. service has always been pleasant. there is one server in particular who is always so kind offering beer samples, asking how specific dishes were, wish i knew his name. but at the least, all servers check in on you when appropriate and are cordial. overall, come here when you are feeling adventurous. you just might find some new favorite dishes and become a regular"
1859,,1123,5,2/18/16,"quinn's was the first stop on my quest to conquer seattle eats this past weekend. i have to say the expectations were set pretty high after this meal. as far as wait time goes, it was a very reasonable  minutes considering it was a  day valentinespresidents day weekend. we just pulled up a seat at the bar and enjoyed some delicious cider and beer until they text us that our table was ready. the decor is great, i definitely loved the vibe that was created by this place. my boyfriend and i started with the scotch egg and the creamed carrot soup as our appetizers and they were both extremely delicious i decided to go for the wild boar sloppy joe with a duck egg and it was just as good as i expected it to be. my boyfriend had the burger and was also very impressed with his meal. the service was also great our waitress was very attentive during our whole meal. i would definitely recommend quinn's to any friends traveling to seattle."
1860,,1123,5,1/16/16,great little we pub just north of seattle university.  had some nice seats up above the bar in a loft.  the beers were great.  i had manny's ipa with the fish and chips. quality fish. good fries. we also had the wild boar sloppy joe .  that was also good.  we will visit again if we are in the area.
1861,,1123,4,3/10/17,"quinn's is an awesome joint for dining in on a weekend or takeout at anytime. some goodies from the menu to consider are salted cod frites freshly fried and sauces to enhance it, roasted bone marrow which are amazing to chase down with your fav drink, pork belly yumminess, any burgers request a piece of foie gras as an additional topping, or hudson valley foie gras. items to avoid would be the foie fries which were a disappointment and other selections that can be soaked in alcohol to the point that the natural flavors of the dish become spoiled--it is  and over only, so that is to be expected. definitely a lively environment for those residing in or around the seattle area. plenty of bakeries and donut shops right around the corner or nearby if you need to wash all that goodiness down with something sweet too. go get it."
1862,,1123,4,10/15/16,"the wild boar sloppy joe is still my favorite here. roasted bone marrow is really good. they still attract a good crowd. nice ambience of modern, urban pub. fun place with friends. good cocktails and good service."

1864,,1123,3,4/5/16,"first customers to walk in at pm on a tuesday. we came here for happy hour and we were greeted by no one. i saw an employee sitting upstairs and she took her sweet time coming down to seat us. she had an extreme b*tch face when we asked her if the bar or tables were available. she stood behind the bar with her arms crossed and gave this vibe like we were bothering her. we eventually decided to sit at the bar and she tossed the menus to us. she warmed up a little bit after we decided on what to order,  ipa's and a few plates. we got. roasted bone marrow  -huge portion you get  whole bones sliced in half but there was not much flavor. scotch egg  -my friend liked this, i thought it tasted average. foie gras frites  -crispy fries with great foie gras sauce but it turned cold and super soggy pretty quickly.  i wanted the seared foie gras -available at pm.not the shaved one.  salt cod fritters  -our fav came out so crispy and piping hot with a delicious remoulade if it was not for the few tasty dishes and great space, i would have given quinn's a  star based on their bartenders customer service. i understand it is a relaxed environment but standing there socializing with your friend, hunched over the bar and cussing while other customers are trying to eat is really off putting.for us, at least."
1865,,1123,4,7/22/15,"quinn's is a fantastic gastropub in the heart of everything hustly and bustly in capitol hill. we walked in at around  p.m. on a monday night not really knowing what to expect. the menu seemed to be geared more towards drinking the bar was packed, but since we were starving, we picked out a bunch of bites to eat from the menu. they are as follows. charcuterie platter definitely did not blrace myself for this type of a dish from a gastropub. the charcuterie here includes amazing pates, terrines and fruit mustard. everything was surprisingly light but really, really good. roasted bone marrow this was not a favorite. the marrow was kind of. congealed. it was kind of hard to choke down. the good news is that this dish is definitely not indicative of the quality of quinn's other dishes. just please do not order this one. summer squash tagliatelle another winner we did not originally know that the dish was made with spaghetti squash, but that made it even better. great marriage of flavors with corn pudding, tomato and ricotta in the sauce with a grilled squash blossom to round out the dish. lovely. roasted beet salad i thought we would get the same ol', same ol' dish here - arugula with cut up beets and goat cheese tossed in. wrong instead, the salad boasted delicious arches of perfectly fried, hazelnut-crusted goat cheese in addition to the usual beets and greens. lots of originality, lots of taste. good service - food came out in good time. next time i go back, i'm hoping to try the scotch egg - sounds like the people of yelp have spoken and say that it is delicious."
1866,,1123,4,5/12/15,"how is it possible i've never written a review for quinn's i've eaten here numerous times and have always had a great experience, so i'm clearly overdue. they put a damn good unique spin on traditional fare. favorites include the roasted bone marrow , poutine, wild boar sloppy joe + duck egg, beef tartare, and the charcuterie. quinn's also has a great selection of beer and fabulous cocktails. it is an awesome place to start, or end your night."
1867,,1123,5,1/24/15,the food is incredible - from the foie gras frites  to the roasted bone marrow to the scotch eggs - this is the place for foodies to go and enjoy.  great atmosphere - fantastic drink offerings and stunning food.   and for those that just want more normal fare - you will not be disappointed.
1868,,1123,3,11/10/14,"i had been perusing the menu for weeks leading up to eating here. finally got a sitter and went out for a date night with my husband. non-busy sunday night, and we got led to a table by the window with a huge concrete column blocking our view outside. ok, not ideal but not worth asking to move. we ordered drinks and shared the roasted bone marrow , scotch egg and seared foie gras. the good the seared foie gras - nothing short of amazing. it was delicious - would return for this dish alone. the bad the scotch egg was not too exciting - the menu stated it is a soft boiled egg, but it was definitely hard boiled. the most disappointing was the bone marrow - it came out looking awesome, but as we started eating it with the complimentary baguette which was so good, by the way, we found there to be too much congealed fat. there was one small bone in which the marrow was fine but the two larger bones just made us feel gross. got to give props to a generously-sized serving, though."
1869,,1123,4,11/9/14,"cool spot in an area of seattle that is filled with a bunch of great spots to ingest and imbibe. having a varied and unique selection of craft beers on tap local and foreign, naturally i started my review of the menu here and did not peruse the food offerings until i had made my brew selection. because we were in desperate need of some foie gras before we headed back to cali, we decided to get a double dose of duck the foie gras frites with shaved foie gras and foie sauce and the seared hudson valley foie gras with mushroom bread pudding. my favorite of the two was the seared foie gras, by far. the mushroom bread pudding was a perfect accompaniment. if i preferred the taste of cold foie gras over cooked, then i might have actually liked the frites better. we also ordered a small plate of the marinated olives, a scotch egg, and the roasted bone marrow with red onion marmalade that was accompanied by a few slices of extra buttery grilled bread. the bone marrow was excellent probably the best i've had, and they gave a lot. the toppings on the bone marrow provided an excellent taste and texture contrast with the marrow . it was a very very rich and filling meal we had here--there was definitely some artery cloggage going on--but it was a very good one as well."
1870,,1123,4,9/15/14,"honestly, i would give this place a , but the fois gras poutine kind of deserved a  on its own, so i will even it out. we also had the cous cous gnocchi not so good, the andoullie sausage also not impressive, and the roasted bone marrow extremely rich and hard for one person to eat alone. it was not all the great, but i just keep dreaming about that gravy on the poutine and would really like to come here again"
1871,,1123,4,1/11/14,dishes made me go mmmmm. seared hudson valley foie gras roasted bone marrow scotch egg made me go hmmm. pan seared sea scallops liked the sauce made me go eh wild boar sloppy joe painted hills beef tartare salt cod fritters drinks made me tipsy bonal 'n cider
1872,,1123,4,8/19/13,"i've been wanting to go to quinn's for a while. i've walked past numerous times, slowing down just to gaze at the much hyped burger and hoping for a glimpse of the famous roasted bone marrow . i've combed the yelp page for reviews and pictures. google has let me know that i've visited their website  times just to ogle at the menu. so i was feeling considerably excited the friday evening i finally visited. i came here with my bf and we had a plan in mind. we split three items the burger, the roasted bone marrow , and frites with the foie gras shavings and gravy. the burger was solid. top notch ingredients really do make a difference. the beef, brioche, cheese. simple excellence. my only complaint is that since i was sharing it, it was a bit on the smaller side. it is too good to share. order your own i've never had roasted bone marrow before, so this was the dish that i was most eagerly anticipating. the bone marrow was extremely rich and fatty. it was a little jelly-like, which put off the bf a little so i ended up eating most of it. although i enjoyed it, there was definitely not enough of the bread served with it. we ended up taking home one of the bones because we did not want to eat it plain. the foie did not really come through very well on the frites but they were still tasty nonetheless. i have a bit of a poutine obsession, and while these are not poutine, it is a damn good substitute. i think these are different from the foie gras frites on the menu from the pictures i've seen. i ordered one of their ciders on tap, which i initially thought was at a good price, but it was served in a mason jar. and i was expecting a pint. oh well. i still very much enjoyed my experience. cannot wait to return and have a burger all to myself"
1873,,1123,3,6/29/13,"maybe it was an off night, but i was not impressed. the one exception was the foie gras, which was excellent. on the other hand, the taste of the roasted bone marrow was obliterated by the butter and garlic on the toast it is served with.  it was also incredibly loud, making conversation difficult."
1874,,1123,5,5/12/13,"oh my glob. my meal at quinn's was for sure the best meal i have in seattle so far. it always looks super busy so we did have to wait awhile, but it was not bad considering some bar seating opened up pretty quickly. their full bar is really nice and definitely a great hang out spot. if you do not mind spending a few extra bucks per drink. i came here with two other foodies so we decided to order several small plates to share. we ordered. roasted bone marrow , grilled octopus and stuffed squid, oxtail and potato gnocchi, foie gras frites, and the beef tartar. so frickinggg good. everything. my fav- the oxtail and gnocchi. the gnocchi was heavenly and the oxtail was the most tender thing i've eaten in my recent life. ugghhh so good. its a bit expensive, but i would most certainly come here again on the occasions where my wallet is not so empty."
1875,,1123,4,4/21/13,quinn's is one of my favorite spots on cap hill. it is nestled on the corner of th & pine with large windows to look out of if you are in the mood to people watch. i have found the bartenders to be pretty consistent with their preparation of the drinks and that says a lot because i like to enjoy a good old fashion which is pretty hard to make to my liking. i normally order the seared foie gras for starters and the wild boar sloppy joe topped with a duck egg for my main course. that combination is just heaven in my mouth. i recommend that you also try their roasted bone marrow which is an amazingly flavorful spread that is delicious with bread. they are normally pretty busy so expect a wait if you are dining in. sometimes you can get lucky and find a seat at the bar so always keep a look out. i'm a big fan of this place and recommend it to anyone.
1876,,1123,4,3/30/13,it is a good drinking spot in capital hill area. i loved the roasted bone marrow there. the marrow taste can be masked by the marmalade they have on it. the wild board sloppy joe was good but i guess i'm just not that big a fan of sloppy joe's anymore. the salt cod fritters were pretty tasty. the warm brownie & peanut caramel was pretty good. street parking and can get crowded during the weekend.
1877,,1123,4,3/5/10,"the service can be spotty especially on crowded days and the ambiance is just a tad too hipster-than-thou for my taste but all that is really inconsequential when you have food this good. not even the annoying couple who just could not manage to not be groping each every five seconds bothered me once the food came before the food arrived i was ready to start throwing knives and forks. i've heard people describe this place as america but it is more like rustic franco-american . think chicago meets marseilles. there is nothing too fanciful . it is all just well thought out food prepared with care. we had the beet salad which was fine not much you can or should do with a beet salad. after that, though, the real meal started roasted bone marrow was rich and beefy, the blood sausage and duck egg on a brioche is an egg mcmuffin from culinary heaven. so many items on the menu seemed quite promising especially the roasted goat. they also have a pretty good burger and great fries for the less adventurous eaters out there. i plan to return to quinns quite often. hopefully that annoying couple will not be there and i will be able to change my review to five stars."
1878,,1123,4,8/12/09,"any place that regularly features roasted bone marrow is a friend of mine  yes, 'meat butter' is one of my latests food crushes and i am a sucker for it.   their version has some kind of sweet fruity relish on top and thinly sliced crusty bread to shmear the marrow on.  simply divine  i also really enjoyed their burger which features painted hills grass fed beef.  the place can be a bit loud and i wish they would turn down the tunes a bit am i gettinig old but the overall atmosphere is pretty laid back."
1879,,1123,5,5/23/08,"pub food for the foodie. love this place pros - great service. % of the dishes i've had were outstanding wild boar sloppy joe, hamburger and hand cut fries, skirt steak & fries, rabbit pate which i do not usually like, roasted bone marrow , meatball sliders, pretzel the first time, plate of fries. and more. great food for the price. they change up things on the menu so they usually have something new to try each time you are there. cons - having to wait for a table. usually not too bad, but they do not take reservations, unless you have a large party for the big table upstairs. food- grilled cheese and ham sandwich not bad, or good, just kind of there, burnt overcooked pretzel the second time we had it, they have changed bakers now and i will try the pretzel again. parking - can be hard to find parking in the area."
1880,,1123,4,8/29/18,boyfriend and i ended up here after previous plans fell thru. checked what was close by and went here. so glad we did food was delicious i had the sloppy joe and the boyfriend tried the scotch egg . neither of us was disappointed and the boyfriend even laughed at me for how i was scarfing down the sloppy joe cuz it was so good i even really liked the regular fries. boyfriend had the smokey cocktail which was definitely different. i had a couple sips and it was like a campfire in your mouth  i do not know how they make that happen but it is pretty cool. would definitely go back if in the area.
1881,,1123,4,8/10/18,"great food experience here- great portions and very good beer selection. this is a go to spot for me for people out of town. food is very well thought out and executed great., scotch eggs are done perfect, bone marrow dish one if the best versions in seattle. foie fries was s miss for me- it turned the fries into an unctuous mess. entrees were delicious trout, steaks and burgers are all consistently good. overall this a good casual spot to take friends- great share plates as well as entree options."
1882,,1123,5,3/23/18,i love this restaurant i love that i can go for one drink or a full dialed in meal basically.you can dress it up or dress it down. haha. i'm looking forward to when they will be open for lunch as the restaurant is across the street from my apartment. i would be there a few times a week my favorite thing on the menu is the scotch egg . amazing. you can get it for even less during their amazing happy hour. m-f - and sunday - sit at the bar.have josh make you a drink
1883,,1123,5,1/17/18,"absolutely loved it. great ambiance, service was good for the most part, had one guy who was a little off. i got the scotch egg , absolutely delicious, crispy and creamy on a bed of cabbage, would definitely order again. drinks had a hefty poor. the bf ordered the fois gras fries, he very much enjoyed those. very busy during a weekday night but sat right away"
1884,,1123,5,1/9/18,"food and atmosphere  stars we had the scotch egg bomb my favorite would be their king oyster mushrooms so simple but the best. my husband loved their pork belly, egg and fries. we do not go out much but we do we like to check out new places and this one is just right. fun not over powering and great place for date nights"
1885,,1123,4,10/20/17,"great pub where the food is not fussy - it is just made well. the meats are dried, cured and butchered all in house here.  the pork belly melts in your mouth, and i love the side of charred brussel sprouts. the fish special is always a treat.  last night they had ono flown in from hawaii which my cousin said was great. i ordered the scotch egg and was not disappointed-  it was delicate and flavorful.  lastly, the fish and chips are always solid here."
1886,,1123,5,7/31/17,"this place is cute to have a nice dinner talk relax. we ordered cod fritters  surprisingly sooo sooo good bone marrow  it is good, but the onion makes it a bit too sweet scotch egg   love it the brussel sprout on the bottom makes it balance beef tartare  i'm just okay with it, but my cousin loves it it is good, but it is not exceptional. burger  the patty is sooo juicy and tasty. the fries cooked perfectly. i love this place the server is also nice. we asked for more bread because we did not have enough bread for the bone marrow and no question asked, he gave it to us. definitely will recommend this place to people"
1887,,1123,5,6/14/17,"had a wonderful evening  quinn's. they have wonderful beer selection, and food which can go so well with the beers. i had the most pleasant egg in the world from quinn's, its call  scotch egg . their extra large beer is very affordable, great for groups of . definitely coming back again"
1888,,1123,5,6/1/17,"not going to lie, i was not expecting such a nice, upscale style experience in a pub. but i was very impressed with how we were treated here. our waiter chad was great with serving us. he was very polite and did a great job recommending the specials for us. the food was better than i expected. the asparagus, scotch egg and the chickpea crepes were all a blast of different flavors that meshed well together. i cannot recall all of those flavors off the top of my head, but i would recommend trying anything there. overall this was a great way to start eating food in seattle."
1889,,1123,5,4/9/17,"hubby and i enjoyed the scotch egg , smoked pork belly, smoked mushroom and market vegetables. everything was fantastically delicious and our server was quite attentive as well. will definitely be back to try more off the menu and see what other seasonal plates the chef comes up with."
1890,,1123,3,11/1/16,"our experience here was just average for my friends and i. we came here on a saturday evening and we surprisingly were seated after a  minute wait. with a restaurant with over a thousand reviews, i definitely expected to be waiting longer. we ordered the following salt cod fritters - tasty perfect appetizer to share scotch egg - dish was bland hudson valley foie gras - a strange combination of foie gras, duck, sausage, and beans it did not work for us fish & chips - crispy batter, flaky fish penn cove mussels - mussels and sauce were tasty, but the buckwheat noodles were still raw painted hills burger - burger was juicy and paired well with the brioche bun, but definitely needed some greens to liven up the burger the wait staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the items on the menu. however, the food was just okay with a few standout dishes."
1891,,1123,4,8/14/16,"solid spot to catch tasty cocktails and higher-end bites amongst the abundance of bar food in the area. do not expect healthy eats though, as the food is often laden with oil, sugar, cheese, and other artery-cloggers. favorites roasted bone marrow with that red onion marmalade. cuts the oil a tad with its sweet and tart flavor. i've yet to find a spot in seattle that has better tasting marrow. scotch egg , well-breaded and comforting. only complaint is that it is  an egg . maybe have a deal for two normal wild boar sloppy joe subtle flavors and hearty portion size. my husband enjoyed it housemade garlic sausage fresh, clean, and goes super well with the scotch egg . unmemorable any of the salads, such as the bibb lettuce or mixed greens are mediocre. salads should either serve as a savory entree or as a refreshing palate cleanser. quinn's salads are neither and are a chore to eat. painted hills beef tartare not sure how this dish can have an odor and also be flavorless at the same time."
1892,,1123,3,7/29/16,"let us start off by saying i would like to give less stars but the only thing that saved it was the food. the service was horrible, act must have been broken or something because it was really hot and smelly the whole time we were there. usually i can get over these things, but that stench was wicked. no idea what it was. but let us get to the good stuff. we ordered the foie gras frites and scotch egg as an appy to get us started. scotch egg was really delicious and the frites were so so. the kicker though, was my entree. it was the only reason i decided to come check this place out. the famous wild boar sloppy joe. i ordered w a duck egg on top and i'm glad i did. it was definitely sloppy actually had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork lol. probably will not be back for a while but might give it another try one day."
1893,,1123,3,5/8/16,we had their scotch egg and foie gras frites. their scotch egg was made perfectly and tasted heavenly. i wish the order came with more than just the single egg . foie gras frites were a bit too rich for my taste in combination with the foie sauce. i just could not bring myself to finish the small plate.
1894,,1123,4,4/23/16,"went for the end of happy hour on a friday, was able to score a couple seats at the bar, awesome the restaurant is beautiful, lots of dark wood, but balanced by all the natural light. i had a local draft pint and my boyfriend got an old fashioned. beer was fine, old fashioned was average, nothing great, not horrible, just average. we also ordered the crab cakes off the happy hour menu and the scotch egg off the regular menu under small plates. crab cakes were small, but entirely crab and delicious scotch egg was good as well, the brussel sprouts & mustard cream underneath was amazing definitely get it if you go"
1895,,1123,3,4/5/16,"first customers to walk in at pm on a tuesday. we came here for happy hour and we were greeted by no one. i saw an employee sitting upstairs and she took her sweet time coming down to seat us. she had an extreme b*tch face when we asked her if the bar or tables were available. she stood behind the bar with her arms crossed and gave this vibe like we were bothering her. we eventually decided to sit at the bar and she tossed the menus to us. she warmed up a little bit after we decided on what to order,  ipa's and a few plates. we got. roasted bone marrow  -huge portion you get  whole bones sliced in half but there was not much flavor. scotch egg  -my friend liked this, i thought it tasted average. foie gras frites  -crispy fries with great foie gras sauce but it turned cold and super soggy pretty quickly.  i wanted the seared foie gras -available at pm.not the shaved one.  salt cod fritters  -our fav came out so crispy and piping hot with a delicious remoulade if it was not for the few tasty dishes and great space, i would have given quinn's a  star based on their bartenders customer service. i understand it is a relaxed environment but standing there socializing with your friend, hunched over the bar and cussing while other customers are trying to eat is really off putting.for us, at least."
1896,,1123,5,2/18/16,"quinn's was the first stop on my quest to conquer seattle eats this past weekend. i have to say the expectations were set pretty high after this meal. as far as wait time goes, it was a very reasonable  minutes considering it was a  day valentinespresidents day weekend. we just pulled up a seat at the bar and enjoyed some delicious cider and beer until they text us that our table was ready. the decor is great, i definitely loved the vibe that was created by this place. my boyfriend and i started with the scotch egg and the creamed carrot soup as our appetizers and they were both extremely delicious i decided to go for the wild boar sloppy joe with a duck egg and it was just as good as i expected it to be. my boyfriend had the burger and was also very impressed with his meal. the service was also great our waitress was very attentive during our whole meal. i would definitely recommend quinn's to any friends traveling to seattle."
1897,,1123,5,1/10/16,"we had already eaten a big dinner at lark and was really full but we decided to walk over to quinn's to try the bone marrow and grab some drinks. it was kind of crowded when we walked in, but i was relieved to see that everyone was dressed down because i felt so under dressed at lark. our server dominic was amazing we told him we really wanted to try the bone marrow even though we had just eaten so he told us he would put in a half order for us instead of a full. we also ordered a scotch egg and two old fashioned. we were so glad we took dominic's advice because when the bone marrow came out, they were huge we barely finished one but it was really good and flavorful. better than bone marrows i've had at other places and for half the cost it was a steal we ended up just hanging out here the whole night, because of how mellow the place was. towards the end of our meal, my friend decided to order the winter crisp pretty much like an apple crisp but i guess with winter fruits. when it came time to pay for everything dominic let us know that he had taken care of our dessert and it honestly made our night. we both had a bad day and just that simple gesture really cheered us up, so thank you dominic . definitely go here and check them out food and service are amazing here."
1898,,1123,3,12/31/15,"i might be alone in this one, but i did not enjoy my meal here at all. service was great, ambiance overlooking the bar was great, but my food was just too damn salty. keep in mind that i'm a super meat eater raised from birth with an immunity to salt, but i just could not get a grip on how salty my tongue was. i feel like someone in the kitchen spilled a bag of salt by mistake and it got everywhere. ugh, i really wanted to like this place. -- scotch egg -- the salt was tame in this one, but still was a little on the extra side. yolk was running and perfect. crust was crunchy, but overall it is not a savior. --fries with foie-- i was excited for this. i prepped my whole life for foie. sadly, this was not the foie i was looking for. the foie mix on top was ruined by the extra saltiness they battered into it. leave the foie alone and it will do magic, but the tinkering dropped it so downhill. it did not help that the fries were on the soggy side when it came out. --marrow bones-- alright, this was the savior here. the largest pile of marrow in a single order. label me impressed here as the bones were piled high  stacks. i could not believe my eyes. i enjoyed these immensely. no complaints about the flavor and taste of this one."
1899,,1123,5,12/8/15,"was in there last night for a quick late night bite and had a bloody mary and a couple small plates - the scotch egg and the pretzel with cheese sauce. all three were amazing - the pretzel was certainly the best pretzel i've everrrr had, especially with that cheese sauce. can i order a to-go vat of the cheese sauce, please great service too - the two guys working were very professional and friendly. loved the ambience as well. and they serve food until midnight on mondays will be back in for sure."
1900,,1123,4,7/15/18,i've been to quinn's four times now.  i try to go whenever i'm in seattle.  it was originally recommended to me by a supervisor. sometimes i just have a few appetizers and sometimes i go for the steak- frites or the sloppy joe.  i especially like the roasted beef marrow bones.  very rich and extravagant but a rare treat.  they have a good selection of wines and very good service.  a great option is to eat at the bar.
1901,,1123,5,9/22/17,"words cannot describe what my taste buds are feeling right now. my date and i got the frites , short rib, collards, and mashed potatoes. this was the best meal i can remember, it is worth noting that i have dropped hundreds at steakhouses before. our server shane was phenomenal, constantly checking to see how each course was without over doing it. the staff in general was amazing, shoutout to austin. the gm even stopped by our table to see how everything was. it was the best service, atmosphere a woodworkers dream, and meal all combined into one. if you ever need to treat yourself to a great night, quinn's certainly is the perfect choice."
1902,,1123,5,7/5/17,"we found this place because my fiance really wanted poutine after spending sometime north of the border. not only were the  frites  amazing with or without the foie gras, but everything else was just as tasty. we shared the steamed mussles which were served in a slightly-spicy tomato cream and the buffalo sloppy joe with a duck egg. everything was so decadent and rich, and perfect for sharing. we also happened to go on half-price large bottle night, and our server did the most amazing job recommending the perfect pairing. topping off the night we had the banana pudding which was delicious and definitely not too sweet. we could not resit and ordered a nd serving of frites to end the meal. ambiance, neighborhood, food, drinks, and staff here all exceeded expectations."
1903,,1123,3,3/21/17,"a friend recommended this place. we had dinner for two. ordered the quinn burger , pea pasta , frites , two ipas, and two glasses of sparkling wine. food was ordinary but pricey for what it was. parking is difficult to find. service is great. pea pasta - ham was extremely fatty, and this plate was too salty. frites - exepensive side of soggy fries quinn burger - just an ordinary burger"
1904,,1123,4,3/20/17,"overall fun ambiance with delicious food and attentive staff. the bar is packed with a variety of drinks that are affordably priced. food our group ordered the fish and chips, steak frites , and roasted half chicken on top of polenta. everything was cooked perfectly, and their fish and chips is % beer and % vodka what a funky recipe the steak was cooked perfectly, the chicken breast was moist and crunchy from the chicken skin, and the fries were perfect a mix of crunchy and potato-ey. they definitely know how to sous vide things here properly. the only comment i had about the chicken was the giant piece of polenta under my chicken, it was kind of disproportional and too much. i had a good experience and there were fun personalities."
1905,,1123,4,3/10/17,"quinn's is an awesome joint for dining in on a weekend or takeout at anytime. some goodies from the menu to consider are salted cod frites freshly fried and sauces to enhance it, roasted bone marrow which are amazing to chase down with your fav drink, pork belly yumminess, any burgers request a piece of foie gras as an additional topping, or hudson valley foie gras. items to avoid would be the foie fries which were a disappointment and other selections that can be soaked in alcohol to the point that the natural flavors of the dish become spoiled--it is  and over only, so that is to be expected. definitely a lively environment for those residing in or around the seattle area. plenty of bakeries and donut shops right around the corner or nearby if you need to wash all that goodiness down with something sweet too. go get it."
1906,,1123,5,1/6/17,best fish & chips i've had since nosh. and fantastic freaking frites . fantastic. freaking. frites .
1907,,1123,5,6/16/16,"stopped in for a quick little snack while walking around the area on a monday or tuesday. it was about  ish, and the place was empty other than another table upstairs and a couple people at the bar. as soon as we entered, we were greeted by someone at the bar and seated. we decided to order the frites and the oysters also it was happy hour which is half off a select amount of apps. the frites had a cheese sauce on them which was soooo good and the oysters were great as well, fresh, and served with an awesome sauce to pie along with it. i was definitely satisfied at the end of snacking lol. i would come back here to try out their burgers and other items for sure"
1908,,1123,4,5/31/16,"quinn's has been putting out high quality 'gastropub' fare for a number of years now. it had been much too long since my last visit and it was nice to find out that the quality of the food has not suffered in the slightest. it was a later dinner so we did not order as much as we might otherwise, but my wife ordered a simple bibb lettuce salad, it was lightly dressed and accompanied with a few shavings of cheese and a few pine nuts. very simple, but packed a lot of flavor and would typically be a perfect starter for the table. i went with the old standby favorite, the boar sloppy joe with their frites . the crunchy little onions on the top give it a nice little texture, and the flavor of the boar is divine. it is a little gamey, but not so much that it would be off-putting if you are not used to eating things like venison, goat, or even rabbit. it is a bit messy otherwise you could not really call it a 'sloppy' joe, and requires a knife and fork to eat it without spilling everything all over your plate, the table, and yourself. their fries smothered in a rich marrow demi-glace and a fonduta cheese is a perfect pairing. call the sandwich a 'large plate' is a bit deceptive, though. it would not really be enough to call it a meal on it is own. it seems like it should come with the fries and if you want to upgrade to a salad that could be a few bucks more. as good as the fries are, i do not think they were really worth . they have a really good beer selection with a nice number of different micro-brews on tap, as well as a terrific looking cocktail list. i stuck with a simple red amber that night and usually i do not care for hoppier beers, but it paired very well with the food to cut through the big flavor of the sandwich. my biggest disappointment with quinn's is that the menu really has not changed much since they opened. while everything on the menu is done very well, i got the impression that they would be cooking seasonally, evolving their items, and instead it is the same basic list of choices even though all of them are extremely well done. for a reasonably priced pub with high end level of traditional fare, it is still hard to beat quinn's, but it is starting to show it is age just a touch."
1909,,1123,5,11/12/15,"orgasmic food. i was pleasantly surprised with quinn's food. we were seated upstairs at this bi-level pubrestaurant. the place has very dim light and a modernbarishcasualtrendy decor. they have an enormous selection of beer for the beer lovers. you will not know what to choose. it is a gigantic diverse selection. and not just beer, fellow whiskey lovers. you are covered i ended up choosing the house cocktail missed opportunity. i definitely did not miss the opportunity by ordering it. it was delicious. there was not a single item of the artisanal menu that i did not enjoy. the drinks, the appetizers, the entrees and the dessert were a feast of taste. every single item which came to our table were made to perfection. this is one of these places that you can tell right away that every thing they serve comes with attention to detail, quality ingredients, know-how and perfect chemistry of flavors. we had the frites , painted hills burger absolutely delicious, juicy, made to perfection, roasted beet salad, burrito, lobster mushrooms and salted caramel brownie ice cream. i left this place feeling not only satisfied but also blown away by the culinary experience. definitely recommend his place for good good good food. did i mention how good the food is"
1910,,1123,3,9/25/15,"hanging out in cap hill on a saturday night, where do we go  i always walk by this place, it seems to be always busy, nice looking crowd in there as i straighten my collar, so something good must be going on, so we decided to try it out.  there was only  of us, so we did not want to wait for a table and we saw the bar had plenty of seats available so we sat there instead. bartender was quick to greet us with waters and gave us time to look at the menu. mainly we were more thirsty than hungry, so we ordered a few beers and checked out the menu, glad they have small items so we can share, so we started off with the frites .  it is just french fries with some melted cheese and a veal demi-glace on the bottom of the bowl. it was pretty good.  we were not super hungry at first so we had a few more drinks then later ordered the burrata salad and the tempura battered green beans.  the salad was quite tasty, burrata was great, nice fresh greens, delicious figs, and a nice light dressing. tempura green beans were pretty tasty as well, nice spicy dipping sauce to accompany, batter was a little thick but it is easy to peel off and just eat the green bean. did not really get deep into the menu on this visit, but may have to some other day, interesting dishes we saw like the boar sloppy joe and the cassoulet dish our bar neighbors were eating.  it got busy in there real quick so it can get a bid loud and crowded in there.  bartender service was fine, friendly, chatted with us to make a good visit. atmosphere was nice & comfy until it got crowded, but whatever. glad we came to check it out, will probably go back whenever."
1911,,1123,3,8/9/15,"cool place for sure. the decor is unique, and the service is good. other than that, everything else was very average. they pride themselves on their bourbon selection, however i was disappointed that they did not even have more top shelf choices, including four roses. the food was very average. i had the tagliatelle, which was a good thought, however poorly executed. it had little to no seasoning. the scotch egg was decent, i guess, and the frites were just fries you could probably get at any restaurant. my boyfriend got the wild boar sloppy joe, which was the best dish among the others that we tried. still, the wow factor was lacking. if a friend wanted to try this place again, or if we were wandering in the neighborhood, i would come again. other than that, i would not make a special effort to return back."
1912,,1123,5,2/10/15,"hands down the best meal i've had in quite some time. quinn's has always been one of our favorite restaurants, and tonight was no exception. we started with some tasty cocktails and a few apps. the scotch egg was cooked perfectly and the combination of the salty sausage, runny egg yolk, and mustard-brussels sprout salad was just perfect. even better though was the steak tartare. next time i go to quinn's i will order two of these and eat that as my entire meal. it was perfect. a great balance of onion and spices, and it was topped with a quail egg. highly recommended if you are a tartare fan. heck, even if you are not a fan this one might turn you. our first main dish was a steak cooked perfectly and served with smokey carrot puree and some veggies. the glace was a little salty, but it was overall a delicious meal. if you are ever in the mood for something extravagant though, do yourself a favor and order the ultra burger. it is an off menu item that is a sort of chef's choice burger. it always comes with bacon, cheese, a duck egg, and a side of frites topped with seared foie gras, but beyond that is up to the chef. tonight ours was topped additionally with kale, mushrooms, house made smokey sausage, and peppers sauteed in duck fat. that was the best burger we have ever eaten. still not sure how my husband was able to get through the entire thing."
1913,,1123,4,9/22/14,"coming from california, foie gras was a must have again kind of thing. decided on quinn's because it was in capitol hill and near all the bars we wanted to check out we did rock box, grim's and the rhino room with a pitstop at molly moon's for some ice cream foie was delish we got it both seared and over fries frites . seared was served with some kind of bread pudding like thing and over fried was like poutine. i preferred it over fries, but think both were worth it ] also tried the bone marrow and wild boar sloppy joe. bone marrow was a huge portion. def x the size of something you would get in la. wild boar sloppy joe was too spicy for me  cue the multiple glasses of water. good thing water was self serve. one gripe is the service was snail pace. our server came and told us twice our food was almost ready. but we still waited + more min after the second almost ready *check out the posters in the hall of the bathroom for some cool events coming up in seattle"
1914,,1123,1,8/21/14,took a cab here because yelp indicated it was open till am. verified this on their website. arrived about -. doors locked. could not experience the frites yelp had my mouth watering for. sadness occurred. someone working at a place up the street was surprised when we mentioned it but gladly directed us to another food-serving establishment. crisis averted.
1915,,1123,5,5/28/14,"love this place. it is a good mix of casual, friendly, yet refined. it is not pretentious, but has excellent, high-quality food. it is a bit spendier, but great for birthday celebrations and special occasions. eat the frites - they are like gourmet poutine, and just make your mouth feel like it is full of joy. they have also got a good selection of drinks and desserts. one of my seattle favorites"
1916,,1123,5,5/27/14,"my husband and i went to seattle for our first anniversary because we were unable to go for our honeymoon as we had originally wanted. i had never been to seattle before and have long wanted to visit. after moving to the great northwest back in january, it was much easier of a trip to make than when we lived in arizona. my husband being the wonderful man that he is, did a bunch of research and booked a great hotel a short distance away from all the major attractions. for our special anniversary dinner we decided to take a short walk down to quinn's after seeing the great reviews here on yelp. the walk from our hotel was very nice and we got to see a little bit of the town that was not overrun by us annoying tourists. we were sat down right away by the friendly and attentive hostess. our waiter was great he offered suggestions for a great whiskey for my cocktail as well as a local beer for my husband. the food menu was fairly small but still had a lot to offer. we ordered the scotch egg, salted cod fritters, frites , and the wild boar sloppy joe with the duck egg of course. every single thing was absolutely amazing. the scotch egg had a runny yolk which was just wonderful, and the brussels sprout mustard cream accent was a perfect pairing for this appetizer. the salted cod fritters were perfectly flavorful. the frites were better than we could have imagined. the veal demi-glace was decadent along with the crispiness of the fries. and the sloppy joe, oh that wonderful sloppy joe with the naughty duck egg. it too was better than we could have imagined. there was plenty of yummy meat mixture to eat it as an open faced sandwich. there is something to be said about how the yolk from the duck egg adds just a little extra amazingness to this already amazing dish. we were more than satisfied with our order choice and left there having eaten just a little too much. i also had the honey cardamom ice cream with a hazelnut fig biscotti. oh so good we absolutely suggest stopping here if you are in the area. whiskey, great food, relaxing environment what more could you ask for"
1917,,1123,4,5/6/14,"my boyfriend and i stopped by kind of sporadically, after a frantic search to find a dinner spot before the hanger set in. quinn's was a godsend. we were told that it would be about  minutes for a table, so we opted for bar seating. we got the mussels, burger, foie gras poutine, and an old fashioned to share. the great the mussels. i could have finished all of that broth, but i held myself back. basically a moules frites but with some warm baguette instead of fries. plump, delicious mussels in a white wine broth with shallots, butter, and some herbs. so perfect the good the burger. i only defined it as good rather than great because it is a well-cooked burger with bacon. delicious, satisfying, and well. good the i could do without. the foie gras poutine. i think we only really got this one because we cannot get foie gras in california anymore. but it was much too salty and over-drenched for my taste. i would rather have a better consistency, or plain fries with garlic aioli. drinks of the night definitely get the old fashioned. it is not as strong as other bars may make it, but it is definitely a stomach soother with a great, smooth taste. a kind of melt on your tongue whisky cocktail. the vibe was great, the bartender took our order and made our drinks say what and overall, we would definitely be back."
1918,,1123,5,1/28/14,"quinn's gets my five-star seal approval because i have had awesome personal dining experiences here and they did a spectacular job catering my high school reunion yah, you read that right.  located in the heart of capitol hill, quinn's is a fun date night spot or a place to grab some bites with friends before hitting the bars.  my personal recommendations include -spiced bacon caramel corn - frites -crispy pork belly -painted hills beef burger -nieman short steak it is a great space, unless your waiting in line for a table, which is definitely the case if you are trying to get a seat on a friday or saturday night.  the waiting area is really cramped and awkward if that is the case especially if you are coming with a large party.  otherwise the ambiance and decor is great dark wood furniture and dim lighting. i worked with paula snow of feed co. catering quinn's catering company while putting together my high school reunion and she was fantastic in helping me choose the best options.  i gave her my ideas--nothing too fancy, party-type food with a bit of class--along with a budget and she sent over a few menus that fit perfectly.  i ended up choosing one of their party appetizer menus which included -roasted mix of nuts -housemade soft pretzels & welsh rarebit -mini gruyere grilled cheese sandwiches -dungeness crab cakes w lemon aioli -wild boar sloppy joes wonion-sage crumble -cream puffs vanilla, mocha, hazel this option was a hit.  not to mention their wait service was great. appetizer trays came out about every  minutes for the first two hours of the event.  it was perfect timing, seamless i was never alerted of any emergencies or issues and they managed their way around the venue professionally while everyone was working on gathering their liquid courage.  i was more than thoroughly pleased"
1919,,1123,5,1/19/14,after going to the space needle we came here for a snackmore like dinner we ordered all appetizers because we like to sample more than eating a full on main course. dishes we ordered frites covered in foie gras heaven omg i literally wanted to pick it up and lick the bowl you should see our bowl lol scotch egg - just  egg but it was cooked to perfection mussels - seasoned perfectly and super fresh scallops and pork belly was out of this world amazing too the highlight of our night was probably the dessert which we almost skipped but thank god i insist in getting it must get the honey ginger ice cream & the cheesecakenot just any ordinary cheesecake it was sooooo silky smooth. i also want a gallon of that ice cream to go service was excellent food - very original
1920,,1123,5,10/29/18,"walked in on a busy saturday night before halloween, no reservation. hostess was lovely and gave us a table, letting us know we needed to finish by  as the table was reserved. no problem we ordered the pretzel with rarebit sauce,  fish and chips and  burger. i had a delicious beer, which i cannot remember the name of,  but was recommended by our waiter. the pretzel came, and it was gone so fast, i questioned that it had been there at all warm, right amount of salty and the sauce was comforting. hubby's burger was great, said it was the best he has had in a long time. our fish was fresh , crunchy, hot and delicious. exactly what you always hope for but rarely receive. i ordered an irish coffee, as it was raining and i had gotten soaked walking over. the waiter made fresh whipped cream and oh man, that was a perfect drink. place is kinda dark, but charming and the staff is superb. check it out"
1921,,1123,5,4/9/18,"staff are extremely kind and friendly. the hostess with the blonde hair and blue eyes who seated us was lovely, and the tattooed gentleman with the shaved head was equally kind and gracious. very welcoming, laid-back attitude among staff, which i appreciate. i had the roast cauliflower with chimmichurri for an appetiser and the fresh -cut fish and chips . best battered cod i have ever had. the batter was so delicate and flakey that it basically melted on touch. and the fish was fresh and tender. quinn's is a great place to go for laid-back pub atmosphere and friendly, attentive service."
1922,,1123,2,2/3/18,"so disappointed. this review had potential until the atrocious service crushed all hopes. we did not make reservations. but we were quoted a wait time of  minutes for our party of , upon arriving.  minutes later and we still were not seated. we were about to leave when the hostess told us that we were next, so we decided to stay and wait. which turned out to be another  minutes. we were eventually seated up stairs where one waiter was manning  tables. we timed it. another  minutes before he came over to greet us, no apologies. fyi we would have left already but one of the people in my party was not feeling well and did not want to deal with crowds elsewhere. so we sat and waited it out. eventually we got our orders in and food served. the fish and chips were actually quite good and fresh . the pork sloppy joe was hearty as well. too bad the service is so subpar because i will not be coming back here to try any other foods-- nor will i be recommending this spot."
1923,,1123,4,10/20/17,"great pub where the food is not fussy - it is just made well. the meats are dried, cured and butchered all in house here.  the pork belly melts in your mouth, and i love the side of charred brussel sprouts. the fish special is always a treat.  last night they had ono flown in from hawaii which my cousin said was great. i ordered the scotch egg and was not disappointed-  it was delicate and flavorful.  lastly, the fish and chips are always solid here."
1924,,1123,2,10/1/17,"we came in here for dinner on friday about pm.  it was not packed, but somehow they managed to take an hour from when we ordered to bring the food out.  the pork chops were juicy, but everything else was just meh.  the pretzel tasted a day old, fish and chips were just like a random seafood stand, and the ratatouille was a tiny cup of bland veggies.  it is just underwhelming when the area has so many good options and quinn's is one of the top rated places."
1925,,1123,3,6/19/17,"the service is very good here but i could not say the same for all of the food that we ordered. i ordered the fish and chips and that was good about a four star dish. but i also got the pork belly which was tough and chewy and tasted only of salt. the brussels sprouts that went with it were extremely undercooked and tasteless. the hamburger was not amazing but not bad, it was average. if you go there i would recommend getting the fish and chips which was the best dish that i tried."
1926,,1123,4,3/20/17,"overall fun ambiance with delicious food and attentive staff. the bar is packed with a variety of drinks that are affordably priced. food our group ordered the fish and chips , steak frites, and roasted half chicken on top of polenta. everything was cooked perfectly, and their fish and chips is % beer and % vodka what a funky recipe the steak was cooked perfectly, the chicken breast was moist and crunchy from the chicken skin, and the fries were perfect a mix of crunchy and potato-ey. they definitely know how to sous vide things here properly. the only comment i had about the chicken was the giant piece of polenta under my chicken, it was kind of disproportional and too much. i had a good experience and there were fun personalities."
1927,,1123,2,12/26/16,"meh. ordered take out and it did not come out as expected, at all. maybe it is a different experience dining in, but we did not take the food very far for it to lose its freshness on the way. service the hostess were friendly and accommodating. the reason we ended up doing take-out was because we ended up waiting longer than told and figured it would be faster putting an order and walking down the street to eat. food smoked pork belly - not good, would not recommend. the pork belly was not cooked long enough and tasted like gooey fat. i know pork belly has a ton of fat, but definitely sub par. the brussel sprouts tasted overly burnt. huge disappointment. fresh fish and chips - pretty good compared to the pork belly. maybe this restaurant is too high end for such simple dishes. cannot say it was the best, but it most definitely was not the worst. overall i am sure the experience is different dining in. cool ambiance with a nice bar. just from our experience, probably do not order take out."
1928,,1123,5,7/26/16,"this is really one of my favorite spots in all of seattle. great, quaint spot in the middle of all the craziness of capitol hill. awesome burger. good fries, good fish and chips , good bacon popcorn. they have a solid selection of beer and bartender is good. service is always good. prices are pretty good. casual and hip place. i wished i ate here more often."
1929,,1123,5,6/24/16,great bar and a great atmosphere. several servers made it efficient and friendly. local beers is always a plus as well. the foie gras fries are a must-have. fish and chips were on point as well. definitely a go-to spot.
1930,,1123,5,4/18/16,"great food  we went due to a recommendation of a friend.   a bit pricy, but we thought the food was worth it.  we ordered a burger and the fresh fish and chips .  we would order dinner from there again.  one of the staff was incredibly helpful and gave us other recommendations around the area.  great food, great whiskey, and great service"
1931,,1123,5,1/16/16,great little we pub just north of seattle university.  had some nice seats up above the bar in a loft.  the beers were great.  i had manny's ipa with the fish and chips . quality fish . good fries. we also had the wild boar sloppy joe.  that was also good.  we will visit again if we are in the area.
1932,,1123,4,1/8/16,"just in town and quinn's was a recommendation from a local. the food and service were great. we would recommend the salted cod fritters, fish and chips and wild boar sandwich. the drinks list is impressive."
1933,,1123,4,12/24/15,"loved this place we are from out of town so we were pretty clueless when deciding on dinner. we love the capitol hill neighborhood so after reading many reviews, we decided on quinn's. so happy we went there. the dual-level restaurant's ambiance was casual but romantic as it was mainly candlelit but not over the top fancy a nice shirt and jeans seem to be the norm. our waiter was polite but straight to the point. regarding service, at the end of the night we were not quite sure who we were tipping as one man took our order, another brought us our dishes, and the hostess refilled our waters and asked how our food was. food-wise however, it was spot on. my boyfriend and i split the quinn's cobb salad as an appetizer and the fish and chips for the entree. both delicious. if i were in the neighborhood again i would go back fyi seating is first come first serve instead of reservations, so plan accordingly"
1934,,1123,3,10/16/15,"great atmosphere,  food is very salty though.  i had the burger and salad.  was told by my colleague that his fish and chips was rather salty too."
1935,,1123,4,7/28/15,"knowledgeable staff will make great recommendations, so just ask.  enjoyed the fish and chips , albeit should be a  meal.  my husband really liked the pretzel appetizer, but a crisp crunchy soft pretzel just does not fee like a true soft pretzel to me.  had it been a softer texture with the same flavor, i would have enjoyed it more.  husband loved the boar sandwich.  strawberry shortcake is very good salty carmel sauce on top, which i did not expect.  exceptional atmosphere, but i love all the woodwork in capitol hill in general.  all about the high-class saloons that are not cheesy."
1936,,1123,4,7/9/15,"salt cod fritters even if you do not do appetizers, do this. they are hot, chewy, irresistible fish balls served with tartar sauce.  how do they keep it so chewy i will have to eat more to find out. fresh fish and chips were fried but not greasy boyfriend does not eat fries but he ate theirs. i ate wild boar sloppy joe with grilled fresno pepper on brioche bun my dish originally came without the duck egg and i was nearly done with the sloppy joe by the time our server brought out the missed order. no regrets -- thick, gooey yolk melted in my mouth when combined with the fried onions and sage. service was spotty but when any encounter did happen, it was sincere and polite. next time, i'm coming back to try beef tartare and bone marrow and sit on the spacious-looking second-floor"
1937,,1123,5,7/3/15,"i finally tried this place when my father was in town and we loved it. it has become our new place. the ambiance, food, drinks, and service are excellent. they were very accommodating when i made a special order of halibut with spinach and asparagus and wowed me again with their fish and chips the next time i went. both times, we were served by todd who is fantastic. quinn's is my new favorite spot"
1938,,1123,3,6/28/15,"i'm not sure what the hype is about this place, but i've been here a handful of times and think it is just ok. maybe i'm just not eating the right thing. i've had the steak here, which was really salty. the fish and chips seemed a bit greasy. the steak tartare tasted like old meat was used and the olive oil on the bread tasted rancid. the bone marrow here is just ok too. there are so many other places in seattle that make both these appetizers so much better. lastly, the service here is just ok, as well. the waiters seem like they hate their jobs."
1939,,1123,5,4/24/15,"the foie gras is amazing - as is the fish and chips  great vibe, always feels like a happening place. the drinks are great, so is the service."
1940,,1124,5,7/18/18,"we have been here three times before and returned again today after a couple of years.  sat outside on a gorgeous seattle day.  we were immediately greeted by robert.  robert with a smile.  and sadly, that in itself is better service than what is offered many times - even at better restaurants.  robert was genuinely friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and very responsive when we told him we were in a hurry to get to my cancer treatment.  we ordered the fried chicken sandwich my husband did and i ordered the beet terrine with greens and added wild salmon.  the salmon was good - a little over cooked but because robert was so great, i did not feel the need to say anything or return it.  flavors were wonderful, greens so fresh and wild and the terrine delicious and very goat cheese forward they did not skimp on the goat cheese.  oh and the fries were perfection.  hot.  thick and topped off with course salt.  i'm so glad my husband ordered them so i could steal half.  . another waiter waid brought our food out.  he was also friendly - genuinely so.  he came back to seat another party and stopped by our table again after.  we chatted about our hair styles and my cancer recovery.  he even congratulated me on my fight with stage four cancer.  local  is a solid seattle eatery.  but the connection beyond the great local sustainable food is what made my day  thank you robert and waid for bringing your great attitudes to local  today.  you made our already delicious food, a really lovely experience for my husband and i.  keep it up.  you may be making the difference for someone fighting for their life.  it is so much more than just about the food.  it is about the exchange made."
1941,,1124,5,7/17/18,"hands-down the best fried chicken i've ever had. i had the fried chicken sandwich , my friend got the biscuits and gravy with a side of fried chicken . both dishes came out promptly, and were absolutely amazing the bloody mary i had was not exactly my flavor so next time i would stick with beer or coffee. the service was great. although i would recommend calling ahead or getting a reservation."
1942,,1124,5,7/2/18,this is a great local place.  robert was our waiter.  he was excellent   my boys loved the local soda and the fried chicken sandwich .  robert was very nice to us.   i hope all the rest of our seattle trip is as pleasant as this place.
1943,,1124,1,5/6/18,"so,  years later we decided to give it another try. we ordered eggs benedict, fried chicken sandwich , rabbit sausage biscuit, and ham steak. eggs benedict came cold. the fried chicken sandwich took three times to fix because it was missing lettuce and bacon wade, our server, did not seem to do a good job. the fries on the fried chicken were soggy and disgusting. the rabbit sausage was fine, but bland. the ham steak was a little tiny wimpy thing is that . the point is, we will not be back for another  years now."
1944,,1124,5,4/27/18,"do not look any further this is where you want to eat lunch or dinner. everything here was executed masterfully from the sugar cane sweetened house cola to the perfectly fried chicken sandwich . also the fried pb & j bon bobs, what  finally this might have been the best service i have had in a restaurant. if you are lucky you will be served by wade who was an absolute delight. thanks for a great meal and a great hang in a place with a wonderful vibe."
1945,,1124,2,4/4/18,"local  is a popular brunch restaurant in seattle. it is both highly reviewed and highly rated. i went to local  with fairly highly expectations per it is reputation. unfortunately, local  did not live up to it is reputation. for the positives, the restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was generally nice and helpful. we were here for brunch on a sunday and there was a nice crowd with a fifteen minute wait time for a sit in table and no wait for bar seating. the crowd was composed of families with kids, couples, and groups of friends having drinks with brunch on a sunday morning. also, the restaurant is well kept with an appealing modern industrial theme. it does a good job mixing the bar set up with the brunch restaurant. and lastly, the restaurant is located along other artisan mom and pop shops so it was a nice walk to local . i can see how folks can enjoy their sunday morning around the neighborhood. for the negatives, the food was slightly above average at best. we had their friend chicken sandwich with bacon, aioli, lettuce, and onion and their house made spicy chorizo scramble cheddar biscuit. the fried chicken sandwich was completely disproportional. the chicken in the sandwich was twice as big as the biscuit in terms of surface area and the other condiments were overpowered by the sheer size of the chicken . the spicy chorizo scramble was much better than the sandwich but it was just slightly above average in my opinion compared to other scrambled chorizo eggs i've had in the past. needless to say, i was disappointed with their food after my expectations were elevated from the reviews and ambiance of the restaurant. also to note, the restaurant charges a mandatory twenty percent service charge on top of the ten percent sales tax. so, our thirty dollar meal at the bar was rounded up to forty dollars. this is obviously not a big deal dollar wise compared to other brunch restaurants but a mandatory thirty percent fee can be a bit of a shocker especially after an average meal. overall, local  would be a fair three starts as the ambiance and service balance out with the slightly above average food they offered but i'm dropping it one star because of their mandatory thirty percent which left a poor after taste given the average brunch food they offered. so, local  gets two stars from me as i've definitely experienced better."
1946,,1124,5,2/9/18,waid is awesome we came here from out of town and the minute we sat down the service was stellar. he has a great sense of humor and was also tending to our every request. and the food was delicious per his recommendation. i got the fried chicken sandwich and it was probably the best fried chicken sandwich i've had in a long time. it was juicy and flavorful with the perfect amount of seasoning. i will definitely be returning next time i'm in town thank you waid
1947,,1124,5,1/22/18,"our whole experience here was amazing. claire was our server and she made excellent suggestions - we followed them all and got the seasonal fruit waffle, the biscuits with jam and butter, and the fried chicken sandwich . the fried chicken was incredible, juicy just as claire said would definitely return for brunch again"
1948,,1124,3,12/19/17,"overall great food with locally sourced ingredients, but not good for mimosas. ambiance we went in early-ish here, the time right after the older crowd leaves but before the hung over brunch is cool crowd packs in. food the food is pretty good here. everyone loves the spicy chorizo, the beef skillet, and the burger. everything is locally sourced and feels fresh. i had the chicken sandwich and the spicy chorizo. let us just say that the hype with chorizo is true. it is as good as the reviews say. the fried chicken sandwich leaves a lot to be desired. their fries were ok but go for the dishes that are served in a skillet. drinks we wanted to drink mimosas, while they have lot of options, the size is small while the price is high. i think we got a oz pitcher of mimosa for . a glass was . either way, that is really steep for concentrated orange juice and some cheap champagne. service the service is alright. our server was pretty attentive but did not do anything to earn his %. he gave a few recommendations to eat but none were good, in his mind all the food here was so good that i would be in another world after. price food is priced ok. the drinks not so much."
1949,,1124,3,11/11/17,"we came here for happy hour and the food was pretty good.  i liked the decor of the restaurant.  it looks rustic where you sit in these beautiful wooden booths.  the host and a waitress tried to accommodate our request for a bigger table because we brought our baby.  they did not have high chairs with a seat belt so that was a bummer. i ordered two fried chicken sandwiches and they were absolutely delicious.  if you come here for hh, order this.  it was so yummy. i do not think i would come here again because the service was not that good.  the guy who was our waiter hard a major attitude.  i do not know if he was having a bad day or something but he was kind of a jerk - not just to me but with the other people at our table.  at first, i did not notice it.  my friend had asked for napkins - non cloth napkins for my baby and he kind of was short in telling her that they did not have any.  then, after he brought out all the food, i asked him if he could check to see where my sandwich was.  he just brushed my request off and walked away.  i do not know why he had so much attitude with us.  he was super nice and chatty with the table next to us.  weird."
1950,,1124,4,11/7/17,"the fried chicken sandwich was excellent the chicken was moist and the batter was crispy and hot. it was seasoned nicely and the bread was toasted i have a pet peeve when chefs do not toast the burger buns but this place has it down. the portion was big and came with fries . the sandwich was enough for . meals i enjoyed the left overs after. my coworker really enjoyed her rabbit sausage sandwich . the ambiance was relaxed and the decor was modern and earthy. the staff was nice and the food was served at a reasonable time. overall, would recommend this place."
1951,,1124,5,11/6/17,"wonderful we loved this place. awesome menu. we had the grits with shrimp and the fried chicken sandwich . omg sooo good. our server claire was friendly, engaging, and knew your menu well. we will be back"
1952,,1124,5,11/2/17,"our first stop in seattle food, drinks, and atmosphere were amazing our server wade may have been the best part though. we loved the fried chicken sandwich , amazing burgers, the peanut butter fried appetizer is so great thank you wade and  for a wonderful time we will be back."
1953,,1124,1,10/11/17,"i ordered the fried chicken sandwich and fries . the chicken sandwich was incredibly greasy. it seemed like a piece of dark meat, and it did not cover half of the bun. it was breaded with the skin still on. the sandwich had no flavour, aside from the grease taste and the bacon that came on it. the fries were awful. not crispy at all, quite mushy and soft with grease shimmering on them. did not eat any more than three fries . i was pretty bummed about the amount of cash i dropped for that meal. also the cheap cloth napkin provided with the cutlery iplaced in my lap left little bits of white lint all over my black outfit."
1954,,1124,5,9/25/17,great place to have breakfast or lunch. wade is an awesome waiter and made good suggestions. had the fried chicken sandwich and was not disappointed
1955,,1124,1,8/20/17,"me and my husband had been eyeing this restaurant since coming to seattle and heard great things about it as well. today, we were able to get an  reservation for brunch and were super excited about it. the menu was interesting and i ordered the fried chicken sandwich and my husband got the veggie egg scramble. we wanted the donut but they had just ran out  must be really good so we got the buttermilk biscuit with raspberry jam to come out first. to drink we ordered two coffees.  minutes later we are still waiting for our coffees. finally she comes with the coffees and i ask for milk and she goes oh sure that is just going to take a while.um ok so we are sitting here watching our coffees get cold and two other waiters bring out all our food together even though we wanted the biscuits first. they put the food down and i see that the raspberry jam is clearly a used dish from perhaps a different customer. i mention it and the guys response is oh ill top that off for you. um ewww. now that is disgusting. my gravy that came with my fries was cold and lumpy. we ask the guy waiter who brought out our food that we need milk with our coffee and he brings it out right away. so why could our initial waitress bring it out when our coffee was hot this restaurant did not live up to its hype. terrible terrible service and ok food."
1956,,1124,5,7/23/17,"our first meal in seattle.what a lucky find  all i can say is  fried chicken sandwich   everything we ordered was delicious but that one was a stand-out  so juicy and flavorful - words cannot describe. nice staff, pleasant, casual atmosphere and very reasonably priced."
1957,,1124,5,7/13/17,"went here for lunch on a cloudy thursday afternoon. got the fried chicken sandwich , which was juicy and perfectly fried . all it was missing was a little spice best part of it all was our server, wade. he was very warm, welcoming, and had a great sense of humor. he made me smile from ear to ear i will definitely be coming back"
1958,,1124,4,7/12/17,really excellent experience. claire was so helpful in making suggestions and the fried chicken sandwich was outstanding. look forward to returning
1959,,1124,5,3/24/18,"i was not sure what to think about this restaurant, but i knew it was going to be magical when waid introduced himself to us. from the suggestion to try the apple ginger mimosas and pb &j bon bons , our brunch experience was perfect from start to end. even as we were leaving, the wise words of advice was the best way to start a saturday morning."
1960,,1124,5,2/28/18,"fantastic brunch spot in seattle it was within walking distance from our hotel and the menu looked to good to resist. cute and clean atmosphere. service was great at the bar, both bartenders were very friendly. started with a couple mimosas to begin the meal. the pb &j bon - bons were fantastic oh my gosh. i would come back just for those. little bites of fried peanut butter goodness with a jelly sauce drizzled over and served with a tiny glass of milk. we ordered hopefully, knowing that they frequently run out, but luckily they had enough and when these miraculous bites arrived, it was wonderful. we each got an eggs benedict dish, i had the smoked salmon and he got the crab. both were delicious but i liked mine better hehe. we ended up being stuffed beyond belief but everything was too tasty to leave any straggling pieces behind. needless to say, we will certainly be back here on our next seattle adventure"
1961,,1124,3,2/13/18,"our group of six dined here for my birthday this past saturday. our server was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu, offering us suggestions and explanations of a few dishes. most of us ordered the burger which was fantastic but one friend ordered the shrimp & grits and it was a huge fail. absolutely no flavor and way over priced for the five shrimp on top. the drinks were good & strong and the pb &j bon bons were fun but also a bit of a mess. they should tell people before they bite into them that a gooeydrizzly mess of pb will likely be left in their hair or on their clothes if they are not careful. both of which happened to our group. overall, this place is not anywhere i would choose to visit again. nothing really spectacular imo and for the price and price to park, it really left us wanting so much more."
1962,,1124,5,2/1/18,"yum what a great place they were unfortunately sold out of the pb &j bon bons but i can imagine why. i had a basic breakfast, eggs, bacon, potatoes and a biscuit. basically a different variation of the same meal i get fro breakfast everywhere. it was so good the potatoes so are well seasoned and the biscuit was delicous. cannot get enough carbs lol. just as a fair warning though, the pitcher of mimosas is very small and more like  flutes. still cheaper than ordering  separately but i would not consider that a pitcher."
1963,,1124,3,1/7/18,"the concept of local  is appealing, i like buying and eating local foods. came here with friends and boyfriend for sunday brunch. we started with grapefruit mimosas and pb &j bon bons . both were delicious and would recommend. mimosas were so good we ordered a second pitcher but sadly the pitcher was never got to the table. i ordered corned beef hash, poached eggs, biscuit and my boyfriend ordered the chicken & waffles. i enjoyed my corned beef hash with  poached eggs. no complaints about my dish.  of course i tried some of my boyfriend's chicken & waffles. sadly the waffles were cold which did not taste as good. the fried chicken was ok, definitely not the best i've had. the food was good here. however i probably will not be back soon. although the food was good, it was not worth the price. the food here was not what i was expecting or memorable. there are other brunch spots that left me craving more that i will probably go to next time."
1964,,1124,4,12/31/17,"was laid over in seattle due to weather and holiday travel. walking through town looking for a place to eat and wandered into this joint. had chicken and waffles with a pepper maple sauce on a whim for the first time ever. portions were moderate and the taste was great, very unique. my daughter had mac and cheese in a skillet, yum. the highlight for me was the pb &j bon bons with a small glass of milk. wow, what a warm blast from the past, must try if you want a tasty twist on an old stand by. i do think four per order was about half of what was needed, they were so good. our waitress claire was awesome and service was prompt. very satisfied."
1965,,1124,5,12/5/17,"great food, great service, great prices. we ate until we could not put another bite down and still had leftovers. do yourself a favor and get the pb &j bons bons .they are to die for"
1966,,1124,5,11/18/17,"my family and i just finished an amazing breakfast at local  this morning. we arrived when they opened at am. i was happy to find that the temperature in the restaurant was comfortably warm. i was bracing myself to be cold. as that often happens when i've walked into a restaurant at opening. music was good, lighting was cozy and the environment was just right. claire was our server and she was incredibly hospitable and personable bringing us the pb &j bon - bons to try on the house they were so good and brought me whipped cream for my coffee her suggestion. she was the sweetest server i have encountered in a very long time. the meal was very good. our sons, ages  and  loved their meal. they tried rabbit sausage for the first time and really liked it. as well as the apple cider. and of course waffles and biscuits were a hit as well. i know that yelp has this classified as not kid-friendly. but our experience, with slightly older kids, was perfect. they said they would like to come more often in fact."
1967,,1124,5,11/11/17,wonderful brunch experience. best chicken and waffles i've ever had with a perfect balance between sweet and spiced. veggie scramble was ok and really need ketchup for flavoring so i would avoid that. pb &j bon bons out of this world. beer flight of  delicious local and creative beers for  great coffee. flat % service charge and totally solid service. fun to sit at little  person booth.
1968,,1124,5,11/5/17,"game changer this was my first stop in my first hour of my first trip to seattle, and it did not disappoint. the staff at this restaurant is extremely friendly and welcoming, not at all pretentious in the way you might imagine this place could be in a different city. our server, waid, was a big part of the magic of the whole experience, adding positivity and hospitality throughout the meal. if waid represents seattle's population, i'm in. the food was incredible. there are very few meals i know that i will crave even months later, and this is one of them. the rabbit egg biscuit sandwich with grits was truly to die for. there was the ever so perfect touch of sweetness in an otherwise savory combination. i cannot stop thinking about it the grits were heaven. grits are hard to perfect, and these were top notch. we started with the pb &j bon bons , and oh man, if you are as big of a fan of the beloved childhood sandwich as i am, you will love these. genius, and at , why not waid, local , you are something special to write home about. thank you for the warmest seattle welcome"
1969,,1124,5,11/3/17,what an incredible brunch wade is officially my favorite server and i cannot wait to return. from the moment we sat down he made our experience  phenomenal it all started with him stating that anytime you are at a restaurant you should feel like your on vacation. and ohhh was he right the restaurant has a beautiful rustic vibe with a laid back feel. the food is so fresh and the pb &j bon bons are melt in your mouth delicious
1970,,1124,5,9/8/17,"this place is always delicious. the pb &j bon - bons are nuts. chicken and waffles is fantastic. best of all is wade, one of the friendliest waiters, with the best energy, that you will ever meet in your life."
1971,,1124,3,9/3/17,"i really wanted to love this place. i love the concept. i love what they are  trying to do. but there is having a great idea and then actually executing it. i was enticed by amazing menu descriptions, the lure of an in house butcher. arriving for a mid afternoon brunch, my eyes were even bigger than my stomach and i could not wait. positives the service was really great. the bartender was engaging, fun and made sure our glasses were always full. the pb &j bon bons were little warm bites of heaven. the cocktails were interesting, and well made. the not so great the rest of the food left me wanting. flavor. it was as if seasoning was not even a concept in the kitchen. my chicken and waffles described as a larger dish was probably less than  oz of thigh meat, overly breaded and the breading also lacked a notion of seasoning. the potatoes were a little better, but nothing to write home about. the chicken fried steak was a huge let down, super dry and overly cooked. the corners were chewy and not enjoyable. the biggest disappointment was the 'cheesy' grits. not what i would call cheesy, also lacking any depth of flavor and my friend likened it to baby food. there is a great restaurant in here i know, but i think it might be ready for a little tweaking. belltown has so many choices, unfortunately i probably will not be back."
1972,,1124,3,8/31/17,"decent place for happy hour. we got the chicken sliders very good fried chicken, pb &j bon bons - really delicious, but pretty pretentious display and serving size for fried peanut butter, just saying. we also got the little gem lettuces- very underwhelming, and the bacon deviled eggs-rather good. the drinks were a little on the bitter side, though i like that. holly berry could have a little more berry flavor. all and all a nice place to check out, perhaps not a favorite."
1973,,1124,5,8/28/17,this was our first visit to seattle and we were craving a good hamburger. yelp came to the rescue once again and recommend this corner restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. claire s was our waitress and made sure that we had a happy experience with her sweet personality. we both had their terrific hamburger added bacon of course with some of the best home made fries ever definitely try the pb &j bon bons . a delicious surprise
1974,,1124,5,7/30/17,such a wonderful place for brunch our server waid was fantastic. very warm and welcoming. they have outside seating that allows dogs. we sat inside and it was such a nice environment. the pb &j bon bons were delicious and small so it makes a nice compliment to any meal. we shared the chorizo which was delicious. we will definitely be back next time we are in town
1975,,1124,5,7/23/17,"loved their brunch i had the rabbit sausage biscuit sandwich, and shared the pb &j bon bons and limoncello mimosas. all were delicious, and we all commented how much we liked the biscuits that were part of each dish. good service worth the % add-on and delicious food. they also have a great patio seating area. pricier than other brunch spots but the food is definitely high quality and of course local. looking forward to coming back in the future."
1976,,1124,5,7/15/17,"i kind of forget what an amazing place this is the perfect brunch place in the heart of belltown. my favorite is the pb &j bon bons - what i've never had a bad meal here. claire is awesome, accommodating and friendly plus she has great taste in recommendations. the perfect pear cocktail was outside of the box of the usual mimosa brunch choice, so appreciate the level of service. a nice way to start off saturday"
1977,,1124,1,7/14/17,"i'm actually really sad to be leaving such a negative review, as i was very excited to try this place out on a trip to seattle. however. pretty much every aspect of my experience was poor.  reservation- made a reservation through opentable. arrived  mins early and was seated right away. about  mins later, i get an email from opentable saying local  had informed them i had missed my reservation. uh, nope.  service- laughably terrible. i felt bad as it was clear they were understaffed. but honestly it was some of the worst service i've ever received. it took  mins from the time we sat down for our server to come, my boyfriend asked for a beer seven times, and my favorite. the bread. oh the bread. we ordered the cheese plate appetizer and ran out of bread, so when our server was taking our orders for the main course, we asked for more so we could finish the cheese plate. our main courses come, no bread. we ask again. our server makes an offhand comment as she is clearing our plates about the bread coming soon because it is being warmed up. we sit there. we have another drink. and then. we just ask for the check and leave. the half-eaten cheese plate sits sadly at our table the entire time, never finished because we literally never get the bread. and the % automatic gratuity was just an extra slap in the face, considering how bad the service was.  food - ok. pb &j bon bons were good and mac & cheese was delicious. sister ordered steak and it was so badchewy that our server actually noticed that she had not eaten any of it and removed it from our bill which was super kind. the table behind us sent theirs back too so must have been an off night. soooo. yeah. as someone who generally leaves positive reviews, this was a tough one to write. wish i had a better experience."
1978,,1124,5,7/9/17,"beyond delicious i found local  while researching good restaurants to try during a trip to seattle for my husband's birthday and our reservations did not disappoint. we were  minutes early to our reservations on sunday night and were sat immediately, as our table was already ready and waiting for us. staff was extremely attentive but not to the point of being overbearing. food was delicious. the wholesome ingredients used really set these dishes apart. i ordered a steak and my husband got the cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg. we were both extremely impressed for dessert we ordered the pb &j bon bons and my goodness, they were out of this world i could stop in just for those alone. for information, gratuity is already included in your bill at i believe %. it is noted on both the menu and the website, but it also mentions why they do it ensuring employees are given proper credit for their job- which let us be honest, they deserve it % and also notes if you did not feel service was up to that standard, you could speak with management. we had absolutely no issue with the included gratuity as we felt service exceeded expectations. we will happily return again next time we are in town"
1979,,1124,2,9/7/17,came here for brunch twice. the first time was terrible. had ordered the crab benedict but the eggs were hard boiled and not poached. the second time was a little bit better. i got the chicken fried steak but it was overcooked and a little chewy. the food came out lightning fast and i wondered if some of this was premade and sitting under heat lamps. got sat at a and was out the door by a. felt like a fast food experience. only tried this place because they offer the % back on yelp. not good enough to come back.
1980,,1124,3,9/3/17,"i really wanted to love this place. i love the concept. i love what they are  trying to do. but there is having a great idea and then actually executing it. i was enticed by amazing menu descriptions, the lure of an in house butcher. arriving for a mid afternoon brunch, my eyes were even bigger than my stomach and i could not wait. positives the service was really great. the bartender was engaging, fun and made sure our glasses were always full. the pb&j bon bons were little warm bites of heaven. the cocktails were interesting, and well made. the not so great the rest of the food left me wanting. flavor. it was as if seasoning was not even a concept in the kitchen. my chicken and waffles described as a larger dish was probably less than  oz of thigh meat, overly breaded and the breading also lacked a notion of seasoning. the potatoes were a little better, but nothing to write home about. the chicken fried steak was a huge let down, super dry and overly cooked. the corners were chewy and not enjoyable. the biggest disappointment was the 'cheesy' grits. not what i would call cheesy, also lacking any depth of flavor and my friend likened it to baby food. there is a great restaurant in here i know, but i think it might be ready for a little tweaking. belltown has so many choices, unfortunately i probably will not be back."
1981,,1124,5,7/8/17,"probably my new favorite place to eat in seattle. the food was just perfect from their chicken fried steak , smoked salmon benedict   and the burgers. our waiter wade gave us the best service we have had in the entire area of seattle, really made us feel at home definitely recommend this to anyone coming at any time of day"
1982,,1124,3,7/6/17,"we had the best server claire. she was personable and had a awesome personality we order chicken and waffles and chicken fried steak .  and mimosas  pitchers  the flavor was awesome, the chicken and waffles and maple pepper jelly. the only problem was it was cold and seemed to be re- fried . but if it had been hot it would have been the best  i travel for a living and par-take in many restaurants this was an awesome place. love the vibe but truly claire made the experience"
1983,,1124,5,7/5/17,"great service provides a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. enjoyed seeing our server, waid, truly loving life as he worked on his birthday- amazing to be in an atmosphere that allows him to get to know the customers while having his own coffee- why does not every restaurant allow their employees enjoy a cup of coffee allowing the waiter to enjoy working and have a livable wage truly reflects onto the costumers experience. my local smoked salmon benedict was amazing as was my boyfriends chicken fried steak  thanks for the great experience"
1984,,1124,4,3/19/17,"atmosphere is relaxed and more of a hipster scene style but overall good food. definitely tough to rate as the best since they were pretty much one of a handful of places open on a sunday. i had the corned beef hash with poached eggs and the fiance had the chicken fried steak with biscuits and sausage gravy. both were equally good although i loved his more than mine. my only suggestion and after doing this it made my corned beef hash % better. if i were the chef i would put that tasty yet somewhat hard biscuit open face on the bottom of the skillet. put the corned beef hash over the top and pour that delicious sausage gravy all over it. then top it with the poached eggs, sea salt fresh cracked pepper and scallions. now that would have made it perfect otherwise overall tasty food. oh and just bring ketchup and regular hot sauce like tapatio or tabasco to the table. would definitely come again."
1985,,1124,5,3/6/17,"picked this place after a short round of yelp roulette and because they had both chicken fried steak and chicken and waffles on their menu. menu looked great with a variety of offerings both light and heavy. their coffee was great too. ordered the hangtown fry , loved every bite of it. they also add a flat % service fee to your tab which is less than i would have left but it all worked out."
1986,,1124,5,2/27/17,"brunch was wonderful. chicken fried steak i went with the sausage gravy instead of mushroom was light, crispy and flavorful. mimosas were a hit at the table and everyone enjoyed the atmosphere and service."
1987,,1124,5,11/27/16,"have been coming here for sunday brunch for a few weeks. the food is always great the only dish that has disappointed me was the chicken fried steak , and that is only because the battered portion falls off completely as soon as you cut into it, but it was still tasty, but the service is what keeps me coming back. i always sit at the bar, and the sunday morning bartender ben is about as polite, engaging, and attentive as you will find in seattle. not to mention the fact that he makes the best bloody mary mix in the city, from scratch"
1988,,1124,5,10/8/16,"so impressed with this place. especially with the customer service our party received from rebecca. i do not think our experience would have been as wonderful as it had - without her helping us today. my first impression of the restaurant was, wow this place is super cute  it is got a nice rustic  almost industrial feel. & it was very busy, even for a saturday morning. only downside is that you cannot ignore the old, mildewy smell that the place holds. we ordered our food a pitcher of mimosas, the farmers, chicken and waffles, & a chicken fried steak for myself. it came out quickly. though i thought, maybe a little too quickly on mine after noticing the puddle of blood on my plate my eggs and biscuit were just saturated in the blood spilling from my chicken fried steak . i waved down our server and let her know that i could not eat such a raw chicken fried steak . she apologized and had the cooks remake it. it was delicious everyone's favorite dish of the morning. after clearing our plates, rebecca came out with a complimentary dessert - an old fashioned doughnut covered in chocolate and strawberry sauce. when we were going to pay, i noticed she also wrote off my dish. i told her that she did not need to because it was remade correctly by the cooks and totally worth me paying for. instead, she said that she would just hope we come back again in the future. anywhere that has such a sweet, customer friendly attitude like hers-- that is where i love to give my business to.  thanks for the experience and great food."
1989,,1124,2,9/4/16,"came here on saturday, line was over an hour wait.  so we decided to make reservations for next day. got in and seated immediately. was not near as busy as yesterday. waiter got us water and introduced himself to us. that was pretty much the last time we saw him. after  plus minutes waiting. we had to hunt him down so we can order our drinks and food. now i know why lines can be over an hr wait. service is super slow. after being clearly finished with our food for over another  us mins. we had to ask another waiter can we just pay for our meal. after giving us some smerky attitude,  he ended up coming back and took our credit cards for payment. service well below par, food was average.  i had the chicken fried steak and eggs. chicken was not bad but nothing to die for. over easy eggs were over cooked. i would only recommend this place if you just happened to walk by and there is no line and you are not really hungrylong waits."
1990,,1124,5,9/2/16,"it is been a while since i've felt as if it would be a crime to not leave a yelp review, but i felt it was important to share the lovely experience my friends and i had here last night. here's an important note when i have friends come to town and i want to show them the best of seattle dining for a more reasonable dollar, of course, i take them to local . their food has never failed to please all of my friends, even those with dietary restrictions. they go above and beyond when it comes to making sure that everyone's needs are met. that said i've obviously eaten at local  a number of times. i usually get a dish with fried chicken , or fried something, and what that fried something is sometimes varies. one time i had the chicken fried steak . another time i had chicken and waffles. another time i had chicken over their absolutely amazing biscuits and gravy. while i obviously have a thing for how they prepare their chicken , i've tried their other food off friends' plates and have always been impressed. last night, my friends got the pork belly small plate and the mushroom bolognese. both were excellent, and i was especially impressed by how much the pork belly was jam-packed with flavor. now, it is not just the food that is good here it is the service. even before they instituted the % default gratuity, the employees always went above and beyond to ensure that everyone's order was well-prepped and to answer any and all questions someone might have. i've been here countless times and i have never been disappointed with how i've been treated. they are always prompt to deliver more water when you run out, always willing to ask  about spices or ingredients in food, and are incredibly patient even when you seem a little lost or uncertain as i sometimes happen to be. last night, that very same service went above and beyond any expectations i've ever had for a restaurant. we got in a couple minutes on time for our reservation, but our table was taking a little longer than expected to clear. when we were at five minutes after the time our table should have been due, one of the managers i assume, anyway came over and offered an appetizer for when we got our table. little did we know is that he meant multiple appetizers when we sat down, he asked about our dietary restrictions off the bat and then said he would surprise us with three different plates soon enough. sure enough, we promptly received the deviled eggs, the focaccia bread, and the lamb poutine. all of these were incredibly flavorful. i'm a huge fan of deviled eggs, so i was easily pleased there, but they were easily the best ones i've ever had. the focaccia was great and freshly baked, but what really stood out to me was the cherry tomato marmalade that came with it. it was both something i would never think to make and so excellent and delicious that i wanted to keep it all to myself. finally, the lamb poutine was excellent. it is definitely a unique take on poutine, but the gravy was delicious, the curds were made with excellent cheese, and i'm a huge fan of lamb, so . that went over well. the entire experience made me feel a little like a rock star. and here's the thing it is not just because our reservation was delayed. i've always gotten amazing service here, whether with a couple friends or a group of coworkers. they always knock it out of the park. i want to add that i'm especially pleased with their dedication to paying their employees well and providing a living wage. the amount of thought they have put into taking care of their employees just shows how far and above they are when they want to make a positive atmosphere for customers to visit. they are up front and honest, and they do such a great job that i leave honestly wishing i could tip an extra % on top of the obligatory % or more, really. they will always remain a staple for me."
1991,,1124,3,8/31/16,"it was my first time today trying this place and we were seated fairly quickly during the weekday lunchtime hours. forgot our servers name but she seemed friendly enough. she asked us if we wanted anything else to drink besides water and then told us about their % mandatory service fee added to the bill instead of the typical tip. i did not like that idea first off. i know when i was in europe, some places do charge a service fee off the bat.but this is not europe i should not be forced to pay % if the service does not warrant it. moving along, i ordered the chicken fried steak . it did not take too long for our food to arrive so that was good. my dish was not anything exciting or worth noting. just your typical chicken fried steak which tasted like chicken fried steak should. the biscuit that came with it was pretty good though buttery, soft, great texture.  it reminded me of the fair scones, but better. the jam it came with made it sooooo good. overall, the food was ok nothing exciting. the service at our table was something else. which is why i do not like having a tip masked as a service fee shoved down my throat. after dropping our food off, we did not see our waiter once. only at the end of our lunch when we were sitting around awhile did she take notice and ask if there was anything else we wanted.  i think she could have at least walked by and checked on us once or twice during lunch to see if we needed anything. i had to ask another waiter for another bottle of water and a togo box. just from my table's experience, i do not think our waiter met the % service fee standard. there is a disclaimer on the table that said if you think the service was not worth % to let the manager know and something could be worked out. i wanted so much to do this, but i held back and decided to just suck up the service fee this time and just not repeat eating at this place again."
1992,,1124,3,8/25/16,"table for five. my cousin, who was visiting from out of town, wanted to check out this place for brunch. got there around am on a weekday -was not busy, seated right way, & the staff was very attentive. i ordered the vegetarian option, farm fresh veggie scramble, homefries, biscuit.  the veggies are locally sourced, the egg scramble was fluffy and a little bit over cooked, biscuit was alright. my cousin got the chicken and waffles, maple pepper jelly.  chicken was cooked well, and the jelly was very tasty, loved the presentation of the dish. my cousin loved it. also, seems to be a popular dish amongst the yelpers. her friends got the corn beef hash, poached eggs, biscuit  i liked how it came in a small cast iron skillet, it was a bit salty, poached eggs were over cooked, no effort was placed for presentation of the poached eggs to look nice at all. & chicken fried steak , mushroom gravy, eggs, biscuit.  mushroom gravy was very good, eggs were over cooked, she only ate half the biscuit. overall, the atmosphere is very nice, service was good, & the food is alright."
1993,,1124,4,8/6/16,"good little breakfast spot. got the following bloody mary . stars. needed to be spicier, but good flavor chicken and waffles  stars. the maple pepper syrup was amazing, but they put way too much on it. the chicken was perfect with great flavor, and the waffles were good. order the syrup on the side and it will be perfect. mine was too soggy because of it chicken fried steak   stars. tasty, but nothing really redeeming. the star of the brunch the biscuit anything with the biscuit is great - i wish i have just gotten a biscuit and a side egg will return"
1994,,1124,4,5/20/16,pretty good. i got the chicken fried steak for breakfast. and the gravy was delicious and savory. probably the best i've ever had. i also got a side of bacon and i have no regrets. it was also delicious. everything was pretty good.
1995,,1124,4,2/16/16,"this place is wonderful for brunch and dinner very warm atmosphere, high ceilings lots of wood, and a rusticchic feel. i've had the deviled eggs super simple and very good. would recommend, the pumpkin seeds a simple snack, seasoned with salt and maybe some cayenne or something else spicy,  the mussels and clams with a baguette which was very tasty, the chicken fried steak for breakfast be sure to ask for a side of hot sauce, and the greens salad. all food has been good and i have not been disappointed yet. their beer and wine selection is simple but good cocktails are all good and pretty too. i like to take friends here when they are visiting from out of town. i would definitely recommend making reservations i always have. i do not come here enough as it is out of the way for me in belltown, but i always enjoy coming here for food and drinks."
1996,,1124,4,2/9/16,"if you are looking for some tasty brunch where all ingredients are acquired locally within a  mile radius, check out this cute restaurant in the heart of belltown. for big partiesgroups, i highly recommend putting in a reservation since this place is pretty popular. interior of this place is large and cozy and overall, there is plenty of seating at the bar, outside, main floor and the upper deck. came here with a large group and overall, service was quick and it is pretty awesome that we were able to split the check individually per person. for food, the vast majority of my group ordered the chicken fried steak that came with a biscuit and egg. in summary, the dish was ok. the biscuit itself was amazingly fluffy and buttery like flavor, and it was delicious on its own without any condiments on it. as for the chicken fried steak , it is a pretty decently sized portion but a wee bit too salty for my taste and several others who agreed on this. the egg was just an egg and you will definitely leave this place feeling full since most of the portions for other dishes were equally big as well. would i come here again probably, but there are many competing tasty brunch places in this area. i think it is pretty cool that all the food you eat are local and it is a great way to support local business in wa. "
1997,,1124,3,1/24/16,super fun place but the food was not up to par. the chicken fried steak was % breading which was a bummer. service was slow to begin with but picked up. super cool place though.
1998,,1124,5,10/14/15,"after a night of wedding celebrating in the middle of nowhere beautiful lake and woods, much wilderness hubs and i grabbed lunch here before heading home to ca, we did not make a reservation so after ~mins wait we seated ourselves at the bar. the bartender was very friendly and took our order right away. we got scramble of the day with country potatoes and biscuit and chicken fried steak with mushroom, gravy, eggs and biscuit. both was really really good. the biscuitwhich came with whipped butter tasted homemade and not overly saltygreasy. my hubby's chicken fried steak was super delicious, the mushroom flavor was on point. my scramble was perfectly done, i only wish there were a little bit more, even though i felt stuffed after finishing everything. my side of country potato was very heavily spiced with some heat not my fave, but it complimented the light, fluffy scramble. at we were a bit comprehensive since we have been to a few of those places. how should i put it, hipster fusion-holier than thou-super organic-bougie.they are making 'farm to table' sound like a fad. where they serve over priced food that taste mediocre. local  somehow got it right. it is too bad we live so far away otherwise this would be an awesome brunch, or lunch, or dinner spot. "
1999,,1124,4,5/14/17,"jean was our waitress. excellent. food here is so fresh and sauces flavorful. had rabbit leg, vegetable cannelloni beet salad and roasted cauliflower. mmmmm"
2000,,1124,4,3/18/17,"our waitress, victoria, was a rockstar. super helpful with suggestions. the drinks were grand and dessert was lovely. we got the chocolate creme brulee paired with the lemocello. dinner itself was ok. the date got a steak and though undercooked had great flavor. she really raved about the mac and cheese. i got the oysters which were amazing, the beet salad serviceable, and the deviled eggs not the worst i've had."
2001,,1124,2,3/4/17,"i've been here once definitely, maybe twice before. a couple friends were in town and asked about going here, and i told them it was good. that is how i remembered it good, solid, if kinda uninspired, always quality ingredients that shone through. but we had a really mediocre experience last night. service took forever restaurant was full but not crazy. had to ask several times about our drinks just one cocktail and one lemonade. asked for bread and butter because the food was taking so long, but it never came and then the food came and i told the server no need for the bread anymore, and he said it is coming anyway now. food was also meh. again i think the quality of the ingredients was there, but the beet salad was really uninspiring not seasoned or dressed enough, the bbq salmon was overcooked and dry, and the cold pasta she will salad that came with it was undercooked. it would take some arm-twisting to get me to come back here."
2002,,1124,5,10/16/16,"great meal from a restaurant that not only emphasizes locally sourced foods, but also makes them delicious. my mussels and clams were fresh and the broth was so good that all i wanted to do was to dip bread and eat. we had a variety of other vegetarian items that were all excellent- caramelized cauliflower, beet salad and chickpea cake."
2003,,1124,5,9/22/16,great local spot with an interesting menu. pork belly was incredible as were the cheesy grits. beet salad was also good but not amazing. loved the beer selection. try the peach sour. it does not disappoint.
2004,,1124,5,7/1/16,"local  is one of the best restaurants in bell town. brunch is always great especially when you are able to sit outside. dinner is always amazing. i have been here for dinner three times now, and have been lucky enough to be seated in victoria's section each time. victoria is always warm and friendly and definitely brings up the whole vibe and quality of the restaurant. the food is always amazing. the beet salad is always great, the rib eye with marrow butter is phenomenal. even though it is on the starters section, pb&j bon bons make for a delightful savory desert. would definitely recommend that anyone visiting seattle or living here check it out."
2005,,1124,2,6/24/16,"okay, i will start by saying that a good friend loves this place, so i have tried it several times. i've never been overwhelmed, until tonight. but not in a good way. i was seated and waited  minutes for my server to talk to me. in the interim, i flagged down the guy who was serving every table near me. he took my drink order and promised my server would be right over. i will admit, at this point, that i find the your server concept a little off-putting. my interaction with my server was fine and i do not blame him for taking so long to get to me. in my mind, my wait was about managing flow in the restaurant, not his flaw. as for my food, it was mixed. the pb&j bon bons are always delicious and were the perfect dessert even though they are on the appetizer menu. the collard greens were nothing special and the beet salad held so much dressing that it dripped back onto the plate though it was quite flavorful. one last note when a restaurant includes a service charge in lieu of accepting tips, one has no recourse if the service is not up to snuff. i've always thought this was a good practice, but tonight gave me pause. i will certainly pause before going to local  again."
2006,,1124,4,6/1/16,"cool place & cool concept. the ambience was awesome. the menu is familiar and unusual. we tried everything it seems like grilled sourdough bread--awesome deviled eggs--really good tender greens beet salad fried chicken*--different but awesome. bacon mousse chicken roulade, cheesy grits, collard greens, sunny-up egg mac & cheese--good. apple fritters---yessss simon suggestion srsly it was only  of us the food was fun. the waiter was a doll, simon, he was nice and helped us pick out food. left him a wax figurine. i would go back. i love seattle."
2007,,1124,4,5/2/16,"we came here for an early dinner and declared it to be the best restaurant in seattle. everywhere else was pretty subpar compared to sf. great local taste. we were trying to avoid coming back near pike place but somehow just kept rolling back. ordered the pumpkin seeds, beet salad , burger wo bun and this pasta dish. i literally inhaled the pumpkin seeds bc they were soooo good. the burger was whatever, but perhaps bc i excluded the bun and bacon do not follow my lead. cannot beat the beet salad here the best thing about this place was the happy waiter. i forgot his name, but he was just the happiest person we ran into in the city. not sure what his secret is, but that should be on the menu. bill includes % gratuity and employees get health insurance great model"
2008,,1124,5,2/21/16,"took girlfriend here last night as we were in town to watch some bands play. to start we ordered a couple cocktail's, both well made and very balanced. we each had the beet salad with sheep cheese and hazelnuts. wow this was delicious red and golden beets cooked perfectly and the cheese was amazing. for our main courses, so had the ling cod with farro. she kept saying the rice tasted like meat, i tried it and it was very rich in flavor. stopped our waitress and asked about the farro, she said they smoke it to give it depth and a bacon like flavor. who knew smoking a grain could add such flavor and compliment the ling cod. this dish was stellar i had the steak frites, wow the fries were beyond delicious, i could not stop eating them. the steak was cooked to perfection and was tender with a very beefy flavor. a simple but delicious dish. for dessert, i had the apple fritters with caramel sauce. three small freshly cooked fritters that were fantastic on their own, but with the sauce was like food crack lol girlfriend had the chocolate creme brulee and was kind enough to let me have half. this was a very rich dessert, fortunately the candied ginger complimented the rich chocolate flavor. local  has a great atmosphere with fantastic fresh food. reservations are recommended as it fills up quickly."
2009,,1124,5,1/22/16,"this place is a belltown beauty a girlfriend and i were seated promptly upon arrival. our server recommended delicious wine and cocktails to pair with our selection of plates. from the poutine to the beet salad to the pork belly to the mussels, it did not disappoint. we left completely satisfied."
2010,,1124,5,12/27/15,"this restaurant is such a breath of fresh air to the belltown neighborhood. of the + times i have eaten here i have enjoyed everything i have eaten. among the favorites are the reuben, reuben with beef tongue, peanut butter bon bons, beet salad , crab cakes, and their house made kielbasa corndogs. my only complaint about this restaurant is that i moved"
2011,,1124,4,7/9/15,"we popped into local  last night with no reservation and the place was full they still seated us in less than  minutes  the ambience is very casual and comfortable with wooden booths and multi-level dining rooms. we ordered the beet salad and pear salad - both good portions and interesting flavors.  i had the fried chicken - very different from typical fried chicken. served southern style - base of cheesy grits, then collard greens then the chicken breast and topped with a fried egg. it was really good, but so big i could only eat half.  my friend had the pork tenderloin and he enjoyed it. i am not sure i would go back because the menu was a bit limited for me - and i think we tasted the highlight items - but i would recommend it"
2012,,1124,1,6/15/15,"we shared a beet salad . we both bit into dirt clumps. when we informed the server, he just laughed and said welcome to seattle. took the plate, and walked off. no offer for another salad . no i'm sorry. remarkably callous, especially for a customer ordering  shots of local whiskey. the rib eye steak was great, thanks. june ."
2013,,1124,3,5/18/15,"came here during happy hour on sunday. the happy hour menu is not that great. we got the mac and cheese and it was a superrr small portion. it also tasted like it was from the box. the chicken fried liver was pretty good too. beet salad was delicious really refreshing, but kind of a small portion. i think this place is better for brunch. would not come here for dinner."
2014,,1124,4,2/19/15,"wow  incredibly eclectic, delicious food.  so fresh & flavorful.  we had an amazing pulled pork sandwich & a side of beet salad & the most delicious greens that you will ever eat.  pretty incredible lunch.  the internal vibe is cool yet comfortable.  outstanding service"
2015,,1124,1,2/15/15,"just finished dining at this abomination of a restaurant about  minutes ago so this review is fresh on my mind. got there in time for the dinner menu and happy hour of which i was very excited about. the happy hour included absolutely no cocktails, so i stepped out of my comfort zone and order a jammy vermouth and my friend ordered a pink vermouth which tasted like what i imagine radiator fluid would taste like. we started with deviled eggs, beet salad , a cheese platter and beer nuts. so you know from the get-go every single item we ordered has some sort of extremely spicy seasoning sprinkled on it that takes about  seconds for it to kick in and is extremely unbearable. the beer nuts were so fried that they practically disintegrated in my hands before i could get them to my mouth. the beet salad was the definition of plain which is deceiving because it says it is tossed in a vinaigrette. the deviled eggs were pretty good, i only believe this to be because the creaminess of the eggs cancelled out that incredible heat i mentioned. and the cheese tray were all cows cheeses and  of the  were completely tasteless. the cheese tray also comes with a spiced pear spread of which is so spicy the smell burnt my nose hairs. so call me crazy but we thought that if we ordered more food we would surely find a gem amongst this garbage. wrong i then ordered the only hamburger the menu offers and my friend being a vegetarian order the mac&cheese and the spicy greens. now my burger was actually very good however yet again incredibly spicy. the mac&cheese had a nasty sour after taste. and the greens were so damp,soggy, and spicy that more than  the dish went uneaten. this monstrosity of a restaurant had been recommend to us for reason we will never understand. we also saw two other couples complain about their food but saw no affirmative action taken. being from las vegas this place is an absolute joke and makes soup kitchens seem gourmet."
2016,,1124,5,2/10/15,"food  service . ambiance . food monorail cocktails , beet salad , pork belly , fried chicken with polenta and collard greens , and a side of mac n cheese , would have been perfect with more sauce, apple fritters . freakin' amazing and reasonable portion sizes. service it took a while to get seated even though there was a few tops available as soon as we got there. our server was amazing considering it looked like he was responsible for a huge section and it was packed. very friendly and was on top of his game. ambiance great little hipster space. only thing i would change is add some cushions to the booths as they were a tad bit hard on the bum and risk of slivers highly highly recommend, great experience"
2017,,1124,4,12/25/14,"i was rolling solo one night in seattle and found this restaurant on yelp.  i bellied up to bar and ordered a cocktail with bubbles. i settled on a roasted beet salad with hazelnuts -- soo good, soo beety  and then the steak frites for dinner. those were some of the best frites i've ever had. the interior is a bit kitchy with it is mason jars and edison bulbs, but it is very trendy these days.  the bartenders were nice enough and they got the job done."
2018,,1124,5,5/11/14,"do not miss your chance to drink and dine here, when you are in seattle jenn's rye me a river was a tasty cocktail. sylviain picked some wonderful wines for us.  the local white wine from the marsanne grape was extraordinary.  and another pleasant surprise, a local tempranillo. kate's service was impecable.  the smoked pork shank, duck breast, oysters, clams, beet salad were remarkable.  every item has a unique delicious twist.  the foie gras was the best i have ever tasted. the gm and the chef are a delight. we will be back"
2019,,1124,4,8/4/18,"i love his restaurant, it is in a great location and the atmosphere is awesome super chill and great for big parties. food is great, you have to get the chicken and waffles for breakfast poutine is a good appetizer. drinks are good buuuut do not order the pitcher of mimosas unless you want a miniature pitcher."
2020,,1124,5,7/2/17,"great variation of poutine . turkey chunks with the gravy, cheese cubes instead of curds. oh and ethan #putaneggonit he made our dinner awesome."
2021,,1124,5,7/2/17,. it was delicious. . ethan is our new favorite. . good beer. . ethan sang to us. . did not have room for dessert which is a tragedy. . they put an egg on the poutine which was clutch. . ethan.
2022,,1124,5,7/2/17,this place was great  ask for the egg on the poutine .  actually ask for an egg on anything  thanks ethan
2023,,1124,2,6/12/17,"i was so very disappointed in my meal a couple days ago.  after having patronized local on many different occasions previously, and really enjoying the experience, imagine my surprise when i had such an underwhelming meal.  we ordered from the dine with pride tasting menu and added on a poutine and pork chop. th pb&j bonbons came first and they were the best part of the whole meal. next the poutine .the gravy was under seasoned and bland. a side of overcharred unsalted asparagus with an egg followed. then came the mains- the pork chop was dry and had no seasoning and a soupy white sauce that seemed a bit like ranch dressing.  it and also showed up with some of the same poorly cooked asparagus. the shrimp and grits were ok, but the sauce seemed a bit ketchup-y and not very cajun. the topper on the evening was an overly lemon flavored panna cotta. we did have great service and tasty cocktails hence the  stars above, but the food quality at local  has gone down significantly, and it is too bad."
2024,,1124,5,6/6/17,"we had a fantastic dinner here on our visit to seattle after visiting the space needle. we initially stopped in no anchor, but wanted more than they had to offer. we loved local 's unique farm to table food, and the service simon provided was second to none. we took care of the poutine fix upfront, with fresh potato fries and a brisket gravy that was flavorful and not too heavy. i had the rabbit. a good serving size with fresh vegetables and insatiable broth. my wife got the pork chop, and our friends enjoyed their dishes too including a veggie manicotti with carrot marinara. simon was very friendly and helpful in steering us towards the best dishes of an impressive and tempting menu. the beers were really good too, ipa and a sour. all of this in a lovely atmosphere with barn wood accents that made it feel even more farm to table. well be back next time we are in seattle to try more. the service from simon exceeded the mandatory % service fee. cheers"
2025,,1124,2,6/4/17,"i'm so confused why anyone gave this place anymore than  stars. when we walked in we were told a  min wait, that turned into  and not even a peep from the hostess. the bar offers local alcohol but no mixes other than weird tasting overly sweet locally made mixes. after sitting at our table and ordering another round of wine, it literally took  mins for that to arrive. dinner took about  mins to arrive and honestly tasted bland. poutine was tasteless and my shrimp and grits also bland. only thing that tasted good was the rabbit. oh whatever you do do not use the bathroom. women's room is clearly not maintained and even after i told a server how it needed to be cleaned,  mins later it was worse."
2026,,1124,1,5/26/17,"my experience here was so bad it made me sign up for yelp. there is nothing good i can say about my meal and the service was horrendous. the hostess was not friendly and seemed bothered when asked a few questions about the restaurant. the waitress was super friendly and kind but provided the worst service and at one point after bringing our check left us for + minutes and then told us she forgot about us. she was not knowledgeable about the food and messed up our order. if a restaurant charges an automatic % service charge, i'm fine with it but expect good service. the food was not even mediocre. for a place that advertises local sources ingredients i was puzzled but disgustingly hard old tasting eggs. when you pay  dollars for one and a half eggs literally  that are deviled eggs i expect something that does not taste like it was left out at a family potluck for  hours. it went downhill from here with tartar, poutine , and a  dollar salad. when all i've the above plus one drink and one flight of vodka sets you back  i expect the server to at least be able to tell you what is in the flight she brings you. i was so excited to try this place and so disappointed that the experience could turn out so negatively."
2027,,1124,4,3/16/17,"went to dinner with a group of .  this trendy restaurant was packed for a wednesday night.  the appetizers we very solid, we had poutine fries which were really good and pork bellies which were really good, additionally we got the deviled eggs with crab which were good but we only got  and they were  pretty pricey especially without crab they were  and there was little to no crab on the eggs.  i have the wine flight which was tasty, and a kambucha with gin  which was tasty.  for dinner i had the burger which was very good certainly better than the tri tips steak that someone else got, that was disappointing. overall the service was ok, on the slow side. our experience overall was good and i would recommend  the total bill with tip and drinks was just under  not bad for dinner for  people,  apps, drinks and entree."
2028,,1124,3,12/29/16,"i usually have a bulls eye for restaurants serving locally sourced options with a hipster vibe.but local  was a bit of a let down for me. it was my first time in the city and i had read all about this place a restaurant that serves classic american dishes with a modern twist. it was right up my alley. or so i thought. i made reservations on open table the same day and due to uber complications we ended up at the restaurant about twenty minutes late. the hostess at the front was rude. i completely understand, we were late and our table was given away, but her attitude was a bit over the top. it took us by surprise since everyone in seattle seemed so much nicer than the people in la. fortunately, the general manager was in the front grabbing some menus and i spoke with him about waiting for a table to open up. he was super friendly and got a table set up for us within a few minutes. after we sat down and picked out a few items from the menu, we were disappointed to find out that a few of the menu options including the poutine and the rabbit liver mousse were unavailable. super disappointing. the waitress said they were in the process of changing the menu. we settled on the deviled eggs and the mussels and clams as appetizers, the  oz. rib eye and the mushroom bolognese for entrees and cheesy grits as a side. the deviled eggs had an option with dungeness crab but we opted out. they were very traditional with a creamy yolk and topped with peppery paprika and fresh herbs. i enjoyed the eggs but they did not stand out in any way. the muscles and clams were served with about half a loaf toasted fresh bread on the side which i thoroughly enjoyed. the sauce they were swimming in was composed of chili fennel cream, fresh bay and some citrus. the seafood was tasty but again, not very memorable. the rib eye was what we were looking forward to the most. priced at  a plate and topped with bone marrow butter, we thought this was going to be a steal. the meat was not properly trimmed and prepped. it was chewy and did not have the melt in your mouth texture you would expect to find with a good cut of rib eye. the forged mushroom bolognese had a healthy portion of mushrooms, house made mascarpone and topped with parm and fresh herbs. and lots of cooked red onions. a lot. i had to dig out the onions because it really took away from the tasty mushrooms and cheesy pasta. the dish had potential but was missing something. the cheesy grits were a nice healthy portion topped with a nice spoonful of butter and chives. how can you go wrong with cheesy grits. they were cheesy, herb-y and delicious. it was served in a hot skillet and was probably one of my favorites of the night. was it memorable not really. would i come back probably not. i was not super impressed with the service or the menu. our waitress was a bit slow and nonchalant and the hostess was a bit over the top. i did appreciate the general manager who was very hospitable and actually understood the terms customer service. nonetheless, he did claim that he would get an appetizer for us on the house and was no where to be found later in the night. the fact that the two items i really wanted to order were not available was a bit of a disappointment. paired with the fact that the food that we did order did not really have any twist from the traditional dish leads to an a-ok review. i expected a little more from you local ."
2029,,1124,5,9/2/16,"it is been a while since i've felt as if it would be a crime to not leave a yelp review, but i felt it was important to share the lovely experience my friends and i had here last night. here's an important note when i have friends come to town and i want to show them the best of seattle dining for a more reasonable dollar, of course, i take them to local . their food has never failed to please all of my friends, even those with dietary restrictions. they go above and beyond when it comes to making sure that everyone's needs are met. that said i've obviously eaten at local  a number of times. i usually get a dish with fried chicken, or fried something, and what that fried something is sometimes varies. one time i had the chicken fried steak. another time i had chicken and waffles. another time i had chicken over their absolutely amazing biscuits and gravy. while i obviously have a thing for how they prepare their chicken, i've tried their other food off friends' plates and have always been impressed. last night, my friends got the pork belly small plate and the mushroom bolognese. both were excellent, and i was especially impressed by how much the pork belly was jam-packed with flavor. now, it is not just the food that is good here it is the service. even before they instituted the % default gratuity, the employees always went above and beyond to ensure that everyone's order was well-prepped and to answer any and all questions someone might have. i've been here countless times and i have never been disappointed with how i've been treated. they are always prompt to deliver more water when you run out, always willing to ask  about spices or ingredients in food, and are incredibly patient even when you seem a little lost or uncertain as i sometimes happen to be. last night, that very same service went above and beyond any expectations i've ever had for a restaurant. we got in a couple minutes on time for our reservation, but our table was taking a little longer than expected to clear. when we were at five minutes after the time our table should have been due, one of the managers i assume, anyway came over and offered an appetizer for when we got our table. little did we know is that he meant multiple appetizers when we sat down, he asked about our dietary restrictions off the bat and then said he would surprise us with three different plates soon enough. sure enough, we promptly received the deviled eggs, the focaccia bread, and the lamb poutine . all of these were incredibly flavorful. i'm a huge fan of deviled eggs, so i was easily pleased there, but they were easily the best ones i've ever had. the focaccia was great and freshly baked, but what really stood out to me was the cherry tomato marmalade that came with it. it was both something i would never think to make and so excellent and delicious that i wanted to keep it all to myself. finally, the lamb poutine was excellent. it is definitely a unique take on poutine , but the gravy was delicious, the curds were made with excellent cheese, and i'm a huge fan of lamb, so . that went over well. the entire experience made me feel a little like a rock star. and here's the thing it is not just because our reservation was delayed. i've always gotten amazing service here, whether with a couple friends or a group of coworkers. they always knock it out of the park. i want to add that i'm especially pleased with their dedication to paying their employees well and providing a living wage. the amount of thought they have put into taking care of their employees just shows how far and above they are when they want to make a positive atmosphere for customers to visit. they are up front and honest, and they do such a great job that i leave honestly wishing i could tip an extra % on top of the obligatory % or more, really. they will always remain a staple for me."
2030,,1124,4,9/2/16,"definitely going to drop some money here, but they have a great happy hour one of only  or  places i've found in the city that have oysters for  on happy hour. their poutine is addictive. and if i'm craving meat i do not often have access to, like rabbit or lamb, i can always count on local  to have it on the menu or as a special if you go for dinner i've often run into a wait so either reserve ahead of time or check out their sister restaurant belle + whete that is like  blocks away and also delicious."
2031,,1124,2,6/9/16,"definitely my least favorite eatery during my trip to seattle. we went for the happy hour oysters and for the price, good but you legit get what you pay for. every oyster had she will in it and with it being a hot day, they were a bit warm which made it a bit off-putting. i would definitely recommend getting the mignonette on the side or not at all -- ask for their hot sauce instead we also tried the corn dog would not recommend -- it was soggy and just not good and the lamb poutine good, but not on the happy hour and have had better. i had the shandy to pair with my food, which was pretty tasty for the hot day. for being one of the few customers in the restaurant, the service was surprisingly slow. really wanted to like this place but did not."
2032,,1124,4,5/20/16,"out-of-towner review] sounds like a yuppie magazine title. .nope just a cool, seattle hipster spot. almost everything from here is sourced within  miles. we are not all organic hippie like that, but it got good ratings. going into it, i knew it was probably going to be on the pricier side, as locally sourced goods normally are. i also did not realize that washington had such great weather to grow so many things. the decor was if restoration hardware met outback and they invited a hint of hipster to the party. the staff all wore the ever so popular flannel style shirts with jeans and the waist aprons. the lighting was low and the booths are made of wood and stand tall, so you feel enclosed in a little cave while you eat. each table has a candle for personal lighting. it was a great setting and i guess it blends in with the idea of keeping things local and fresh. items our server mentioned that were not sourced locally were tequila, lemons, and limes. haha the tequila made me laugh which i did not really understand, why cannot they get lemons and limes locally i'm no geography genius, but cannot those grow somewhere in wa we both grabbed drinks, him a local ipa, her the bartenders choice mule, which came with a hint of lavender. we started with the pb & j bon bons, which were amazing, but should have been our dessert. the server told us the pb is handmade, then they make the bon bon, freeze it, add another layer of panko, then freeze it again, then deep fry them. apparently it is a long process to make these little nuggets of goodness. they are nestled on homemade jam and come with a shooter of milk, which neither of us drank. since we had a started and had been eating and snacking all day, we did not go too big for dinner. j ordered the poutine -- lamb neck gravy, beecher's cheese curds, pickled peppers and i ordered the steak frites -- red wine butter sauce, aioli. j ate his and i tried it, but neither of us were wow would by the poutine . however, we both loved my dinner, which we shared both meals anyways, so it was a win-win the steak was cooked a little well done, but the flavor was really simple, yet really tasty. of course my frites were well done, just how i like them. we probably should have stopped there, but it being our first night in town i splurged with ordering the washington apple fritters -- vanilla ice cream, bacon brittle, which was only okay. the apple fritters from apple hill here in ca are , times better than what they offered. the bacon brittle was really good and i could have used more of that on our plate. overall, it was a good not amazing first meal for our trip. it was pricey, but we knew it would be since it hyped up the organic, locally sourced stuff. if your visiting town, i would say it is cool to check it out, but it is not necessary. i do not really care how close my food is sourced, sorry."
2033,,1124,1,5/9/16,"we used to love local . however tonight the service was terrible. we walked in to the restaurant at pm, and were told the wait time was - minutes. after  minutes we were told it will be another - minutes. we finally got seated and it took the waitress  minutes to greet us. we immediately ordered our appetizer  poutine  and main dishes rabbit and lambto save the waitress time to walk back and fourth. after waiting for  minutes for our appetizer, our waitress came over and apologized for running out of poutine . we ordered the pork belly instead which was delicious. our main dishes arrived shortly after we finished our appetizer, but took the waitress another  minutes to come collect our dishes after we were done. the restaurant was not full at that time. the service here was terrible, and the waitress was not attentive at all. they do not deserve the % service charge. not coming back here again."
2034,,1124,5,4/7/16,"one of the best dining experiences i have ever had. from the food to the service to the ambience. everything was spot on. we split an order of the poutine , which was above average. not super thick gravy, but still delicious. i ordered the fried chicken, and it was a fantastic decision. the fried chicken was wrapped in a bacon mousse, and served over collard greens and over cheesy grits. and then there was a sunny side egg on top. all of these individual components were super well done. and all of these combined in one bite was just heavenly. the fried chicken was crispy on the outside and flavorful and tender inside. the collard greens were delicious and flavorful. and grits complimented everything well. decent prices for the portions and quality. no complaints and most of the ingredients seemed to be locally sourced. shoutout to our waitress who was basically an angel. so fyi, this place automatically adds % for tip. but our waitress absolutely deserved it. she was friendly and patient while we perused the menu. she was enthusiastic and positive throughout our entire experience. on top of that, she willingly split our check  ways for us, so we did not have to worry about venmo-ing each other. and she remembered who ordered what, and also split our order of fries  ways as well. then the cherry on top was that she remembered who put down which card. fantastic dining experience in a beautiful setting. the ambience was nice, and there were real candles everywhere."
2035,,1124,3,3/22/16,"a review for the dinner tasty food, tiny portions, pretty overpriced. - pork belly  had a good mixture of sweet and savory, but only came with  small pieces. one of the pieces was all fat. - poutine  happy hour price not super heavy like how poutines usually are, but a little salty. the lamb gravy really sold the dish. - fried chicken  came with a fried egg and a patty of chicken stuffed w other meatsthings on top of grits and okra. the grits were extremely flavorful and the best part of the dish."
2036,,1124,4,1/24/16,"i have now been to local  for all meals. brunch, lunch, happy hour and dinner and i must say the food is pretty good. their happy hour is the best. you can get fresh taylor shellfish farm oysters for a dollar each during their happy hour. they also have a pretty good burger and great fries to go along with it. the fried gizzard are a must as well, super crispy and full of flavor. for dinner all of their beef preperations are near perfect. the rib eye with marrow butter is excellent. i seriously wish i could have a tub of that marrow butter. ughhhh soo good  also if you see the crispy lamb breast you must get it  my friend ordered the lamb and it was literally one of the most amazing lamb preperations i've had in awhile. juicy, crispy and super flavorful. i am definitely getting that next time i go. the fried chicken is okay.it is al little dry and i feel like the skin just is not crispy enough. i also feel like the lamb neck poutine has a very strange after taste, also a little too soggy for me. the ambiance is warm and cozy with soft lighting and candles everywhere. service is here is a hit or miss, sometimes when it is really busy it is not as good. i like the concept that everything is locally sourced  miles from and around seattle. really great ingredients. good place for any meal."
2037,,1124,5,1/22/16,"this place is a belltown beauty a girlfriend and i were seated promptly upon arrival. our server recommended delicious wine and cocktails to pair with our selection of plates. from the poutine to the beet salad to the pork belly to the mussels, it did not disappoint. we left completely satisfied."
2038,,1124,3,12/20/15,"a birthday dinner i recently attended here was supposed to start at , but we did not get seated until close to  of the clock. they were so behind that night. when we finally got seated, though, we got pretty good service. our server was quick to respond to orders, and he was really nice. he even sliced up my friend's birthday cake that she had gotten from whole foods. my fiance and i decided to share a few small plates, as we were not that hungry pb&j bon bons, steak and beet tartare, poutine with lamb neck gravy, and fingerling potatoes. nothing special. it was all just okay. the pb&j bon bons sounded better than they actually were. they were really salty. i do not think my tummy reacted well to the tartare, but it did not taste bad. i've just had much better tartare elsewhere. same for the poutine . the bartender's choice mule was too sweet. if you do not like sweet cocktails, get something else."

2042,,1125,5,11/3/18,the best brunch ever i should say had a mouthwatering experience just waiting in the queue to be called on. was not a long wait though there were close to  groups before us. the ambience sung really with the quality of the food very rustic and antiquey settingthe caramel french toast and the banana pecan roasted pancakes though sounds pretty simple was definitely hand crafted with a lot of care and attention  my husband thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast sandwich with fried eggs which he felt had the right amount of salt and spice and was of just the perfect stomach filling quantity

2051,,1125,4,7/22/15,"amazing french toast and gumbo toulouse has friendly service, and they were very accommodating even though we did not have a reservation. i tried the cured pork cheeks hash, which was pretty small and salty. i was underwhelmed by the dish that was raved about as the best thing i ever ate. however, i loved the crispy fried chicken gumbo the chicken was spicy, but paired very well with the gumbo. it was perfectly crispy and filling if you are craving sweets, definitely try the creme caramel french toast  or try it even if you are not craving sweets the bread is so fluffy and eggy, and the sauce is bomb. my sister even ventured to say that it was the best french toast she is ever had. our plate was gone in minutes, leaving our tummies very happy. unlike the other places on queen anne, toulouse has a line that goes out the door, and it is well worth the wait  they gave me a great pot of french press coffee to kickstart my day in seattle, and ended our brunch with fantastic french toast and doughy beignets"
2052,,1125,5,4/26/15,"wow. just wow. i am in love with this place. very cool atmosphere with delicious food, fun drinks and friendly service we came here for brunch and i got the creme caramel french toast --- to die for. best meal i've had in seattle, hands down"
2053,,1125,5,4/22/15,"loved this place i came for brunch with a friend who was visiting. we were told the way it was around  minutes, but i was surprised i only had to wait around  minutes to get seated. normally the host tends to underestimate the wait time so i was happy that her estimate was accurate.  there is a few coffee shops nearby, so the wait was not bad at all we ordered creme caramel french toast , beignets, and the creole crawfish shrimp and sausage. creme caramel french toast was amazing fluffy but substantially dense and moist french toast with strawberries and not too much caramel flavoring. creole crawfish dish was great also - good amount of seafood and sausage with eggs, this will definitely fill you up."
2054,,1125,5,4/9/15,"best  i've ever spent on food. if you can make it in time for breakfast happy hour, everything item is a steal. even fully priced the food is well worth it. my girlfriend had the creme caramel french toast and i had the cured pork cheeks confit hash. if you are a sweets person i would highly recommend the french toast . if you are in the mood for something lean and tasty the pork cheeks would be a good choice."
2055,,1125,5,3/25/15,"i adore brunch, and toulouse petit did it right we came here on our last day in seattle. february  *creole bloody mary yelp.combiz_photostoul. *cured pork cheeks confit hash yelp.combiz_photostoul. *spicy creole hash yelp.combiz_photostoul. *side bacon yelp.combiz_photostoul. * creme caramel french toast  belle de brillet pear caramel , fresh strawberries and pecan butter yelp.combiz_photostoul. a bloody can be too much in the morning sometimes, but i enjoyed this. was not super heavy and had a kick. the pork cheek confit was delicious i loved the tender cheek and asparagus. i get why it was featured on the best thing i ever ate. the creme caramel french toast was a good sweet contrast. nice and caramely with the berries giving it a little freshness. great place to grab breakfast. next time i'm in town, i have to stop by for their breakfast happy hour"
2056,,1125,4,3/10/15,"after a less than remarkable day of dining in seattle, my family and i decided to start the next day with sunday breakfast at toulouse petit. it lifted our spirits and our faith in seattle restaurants was restored. that caramel french toast with fresh strawberries though  perfection. the dungeness crab and asparagus scramble  the crab was so sweet.   uplifting and satisfying. pancakes from scratch comforting to the soul. great bacon. delicious fresh french press coffee. ample portions, great for groups. the only reason why i did not give it . stars was the roasted potatoes.  slightly overcooked."
2057,,1125,5,2/17/15,"friends, i have eaten at a lot of places. i have been to a lot of places. but, i have never been to a breakfast place like toulouse petite. it is the creme de la creme of breakfasts. i mean, come on guys, they have breakfast happy hour and the best daytime drinking i've ever had. ok, swooning is over, let us get down to business. let us start with the eggs hussarde benedict. this is where it is at. i have not had anything like it. it is rich, flavorful, filling, and yes, i may have wanted to lick the plate. ok, maybe i did.but that is not the point. you will not ever have anything like it. that is the point. creme caramel french toast . i will be honest, french toast has never been my favorite. it is always seemed a little pointless to me. why would you want bread with syrup and butter on it when you can have a wonderful array of more flavorful options however, toulouse has forever changed my mind on french toast . this screams decadence. and it really is from the pecan butter, to the creme caramel sauce, to the fresh strawberries, this dish is superb. please do yourself a favor, and order it. bananas foster pancakes. never have i ever had pancakes like these. they literally caramelize the bananas in rum and brown sugar you should be super excited right now and they use that as the syrup. oh and they have candied pecans sprinkled on top. it is like new orleans in your mouth. do not think too hard on that."
2058,,1125,5,10/31/14,shrimp creole is a must. creme caramel french toast was delicious too. love this place. my fav brunch place.
2059,,1125,5,9/29/14,"sooooo gooood we came here for breakfast and immediately loved how nice and cozy it was. the service is on point. and of course, the food was delicious i had the creme caramel french toast , which is to die for. my husband had the crab and asparagus omelette and is was equally as good. highly recommended"
2060,,1125,4,7/8/14,"having been to toulouse petit for brunch, lunch and late night happy hour, i feel that it is high time to share a review. the excellent reviews brought me here for brunch for the first time years ago, and the consistently delicious food and extensive happy hour offerings keep me coming back even with half-hour waits during prime weekend brunch hours and jam-packed happy hours. this place is nearly always poppin' highlights - duck confit hash and cured pork cheeks confit hash as a lover of breakfast hashes, duck, and anything with the word confit in it, i had to try both of these dishes. they seem to be the exact same - both featuring an innovative combination of cubed potato, parsnip and apple - except for the meats. the pork cheeks are extra tender, but both dishes are solid. - creme caramel french toast  soft, fluffy, moist, decadent with caramel sauce and fresh strawberries. my friends the french toast aficionados love this dish. only tilth's golden raisin-sprinkled french toast squares could rival toulouse's, but it is a draw as to whose is better. other dishes - toulouse beignets yummy small triangles of fried donut with plenty of powdered sugar and coffee dipping sauce. i still like cafe du monde's piping-hot beignets best, but these are a pretty good stand-in, especially if you like coffee. - fried chicken gumbo excited to order as i love fried chicken, ok, not amazing. - shrimp and grits my friend enjoyed the sauciness of the shrimp and creaminess of the grits. - yellow beets and haricots vert ok. - buttermilk fried chicken bites pretty good. - beef sliders pretty good. - fried green tomatoes pretty good. this restaurant, with its southern decor, wide assortment of great food, mix of booth and bar seating, and breakfastregularlate night happy hours, knows how to run a thriving business."
2061,,1125,4,5/18/14,"toulouse does many things so well - namely the ambiance, beignets, brunch, dessert and french press. during the week their brunch happy hour makes it cheaper and easier be prepared for long, but worth it weekend waits to try all of the breakfast offerings for -. favorites creme caramel french toast , crab benedict, and of course always start with beignets to share. if my experiences were entirely breakfast related this place would hold my whole heart and five stars, however my meals after the brunch threshold have been bland and underwhelming for the most part. large menus often freak me out, which their dinner menu boasting pages and pages, my theory holds true that you cannot be that good at everything. service is always good once seated, hostesses can be cranky on those weekend peak hours."
2062,,1125,1,8/25/18," minutes to actually get a server. this after the hostess asks if we have been helped, and runs to tell server that she has a table. drinks in, takes another  min to come back and tell us she has been in the well bar term for service station waiting on our drinks.  they were on the table. takes our food order in a fluster. hunty, let me tell you what. you can light all the candles you like and turn the lights down low and slap a service charge on your menu all you like. however, garbage service is not ok.  when someone orders a ketel soda and a french onion soup , let the drink come out first make sure it is right, not tito's and then have the soup come out.  i've worked in the industry for  years and good god, this poor gal is either over worked or just not the right fit.  feel free to hire me and we can polish out the service missteps in a restaurant of your price point."
2063,,1125,5,5/23/18,"celebrated my gf's dinner last night. amazing food, ambiance and service. request for magdalen - she is a great server. we ordered the dungenese crab small plate must have, tuna tartare, french onion soup and jumbalaya. everything was excellent you cannot go wrong. the banana foster dessert was out of this world. we are from nyc and will definitely have this restaurant on our list when we come back to seattle."
2064,,1125,4,5/10/18,"toulouse has quite the reputation when you hear the word happy hour in seattle. i finally had the chance to try it out for myself and would not say it is my favorite, only because i cannot touch most of the things on the menu since it has seafood. the food that i could eat was ok which was a french onion soup and salad, nothing special that i could not get anywhere else with prices being about  on happy hour for each item. it is good to gather a bunch of friends to split the small plates with so you get variety. the beignets are a must get for dessert though i see photos of their regular menu and it looks good so i will have to try coming in for brunch or normal hours next time. the ambiance was lively in the bar area and intimate in the regular dining area. there probably will be a wait since they won multiple awards for dining so making a reservation might be a better choice. the cuisine is new orleans inspired dishes. tell me about your experience if you have been here or is going to after reading this review"
2065,,1125,3,4/28/18,"went to seattle for a professional conference - one of my friends really wanted to eat here - we were there during seattle restaurant week so there was a fixed price menus available - my friends took advantage of this option but i did not. i gave this over priced trendy restaurant a  star because my friends really enjoyed their meals & the ambience was lovely, my french onion soup was the worst i've ever had & the salad was - well - just a salad. our waiter seemed disinterested - not focused on our table beyond impatiently taking our order, dropping some of the food off part of our order was delivered by other servers & bringing the check- only did what he was obligated to do. i would never return to this restaurant."
2066,,1125,4,4/25/18,"our family went there and ordered three soups , french onion , gumbo, and do not remember the name but cream based vegetable soup .  also,  ordered pasta with shrimp,  jambalaya, dungeness crab salad, and meatloaf. gumbo was best, and french onion soup is better than other french restaurant but it was not good as we ate at the france. meatloaf is pretty average taste . salads is pretty good"
2067,,1125,2,3/15/18,"where did the red beans and rice go i was looking forward to a side of gluttony and they no longer serve them. instead i ordered the market salad and french onion soup . the soup was a twist on the traditional. i little spicy and not a lot of cheese, mainly broth and bread. the salad was good but the dressing was intense. it was smothered what tasted like dijon mustard. after a while the taste was too intense and i could not finish. we were really excited to visit since all our meals in the past have been delicious. something has changed and its not good. also the servers were severely understaffed. we only saw our server when she took our order and brought us the check. other than that she would only walk by in a rush to help another table. maybe try on a night where they are not understaffed"
2068,,1125,4,1/8/18,"went for dinner with some friends. server was very niceattentive. i ordered shrimp and grits  quite tasty  kristen ordered the soup and salad  french onion soup and artichoke heart salad . i love the interior design here, such a cool vibe. i think i prefer getting brunch here vs. dinner but the wait for brunch can be brutal and we walked right in for dinner. and the lighting is really great when it gets late. it is a toss up.go anytime and you will have good food and a enjoyable environment. to follow our eating adventures go to instagram and follow the_foodservations"
2069,,1125,4,12/29/17,"had to start with the pork cheeks what a scrumptious and balanced balanced dish i had never had pork cheeks before, but the meat itself reminded me a little bit of corned beef - not a scary cheek like i had thought the only way i can describe the combination of flavors would just be 'beautiful'. for our entree my husband and i each chose the soup salad combo. i had the yellow beet salad, he had the romaine and italian meat salad. they were tasty, we were happy to get some vegetables in it is been an unhealthy vacation, but the real stars were the two soups we had i had the cauliflower and dungeonus  crab - so velvety, the crab was perfect, and the white truffle oil was perfect my husband had the french onion soup , at first he was a little upset that it was not smothered in cheese, but he soon forgot that. his soup was amazing not too oniony, not too oily, just really flavorful and all around delicious. the service here is also wonderful, the hostess was so sweet and welcoming and i believe our waitresses name was elyse - so friendly it twas a great experience"
2070,,1125,4,12/21/17,came here for a friend's birthday party excellent french onion soup and brussels sprouts.
2071,,1125,2,10/14/17,"ugh, i'm embarrassed to have called myself a foodie or yelp elite or whatever and took my  girlfriends here for a late dinner on a friday night the food was bad and overpriced. the service was even worse i came here for brunch before, thought it was decent, and wanted to give this place another chance but never again here's everything that went wrong. the horrible service . upon arriving at the restaurant, my friends and i stood around awkwardly because no one was there at the front desk. finally someone comes up and tells us to seat ourselves. . found a table, which was wiped sloppily so i had to wipe it myself with the napkin on the table. my friends and i sat there for  minutes and wondered when someone was going to bring us menus. . i got tired of waiting so i went to the reception desk which was still unmanned and grabbed random menus, but only one copy of each because there were like  different ones. . waitress comes over and i ask for more menus since out of the ones i grabbed only one seemed like an actual dinner menu. she saw we already had some menus and says in an exasperated tone uhh, okay.what.how many menus do you need i immediately think, hold on here lady, we were sitting here for more than  minutes before you even noticed us. the menus we have, i had to grab myself, and when i ask you to do your job, you give us attitude . when the waitress came back to take our orders, she made us clarify ourselves multiple times. my friend ordered soup and beignets and said she wants them to come out at the same time because she is eating beignets for dinner. waitress says we serve food as it comes out, my friend says okay fine. then, one minute later, the waitress asks  so do you want the beignets to come out after the meal what the heck lady were you even listening . my other friend ordered french onion soup and it never came. we asked the waitress where it was and she says it will come out when it is ready. what kind of response was that as a good waitress, if your table's food comes out late, it is your job to go yell at the kitchen. it turned out, they gave my friend's soup to another table so they had to make her a new one. the horrible food . our fried chicken gumbo was disgusting. the fried chicken pieces on top were not bad but the soup tasted like tabasco hot sauce with cheap instant rice. i thought gumbo was supposed to have okra nope, just hot sauce and rice. my friend and i had to send ours back. . my other friend's jambalaya was no better but the shrimp and sausage at least provided some substance. same hot sauce taste though. . friend's french onion soup finally showed up. it looked really sad.minuscule bits of cheese floating on top, no porcelain ramekin. i've had better looking french onion soup at my college's dinning hall. . i was so upset with my dinner, i decided to skip ordering an entree and just get two desserts, banana foster, and a pistachio bread pudding. what came out was a bowl of caramel  soup  with a piece of mystery brown bread, bananas and walnuts swimming in it, with a scoop of ice cream on top. the caramel  soup  was heavily flavored with alcohol. my pistachio bread pudding was just bread, no pudding at all. my one friend who ordered the jambalaya saw how bad my caramel  soup  was and told the waitress to cancel her order of banana fosters that she had already put in earlier. the waitress misunderstood us again and said you want to send this one back no, we just want to cancel the second one that is supposed to have came out later. i do not know if it is because we were three asian girls, but our waitress seriously acted like she could not understand our english like we had accents or something which we do not and made us explain ourselves repeatedly. . did not hear my friend complain about the beignets but it is just fried dough. btw, the same # of beignets cost  for dinner but  for brunch. what are your prices rip off. the restaurant manager must have noticed that we were upset because she came over and asked us if everything was okay. we complained and she gave us half off our bill. she apologized profusely and hope that we would go back and it will be better next time. the manager's gesture was the only reason i'm giving this restaurant  stars instead of the  that it deserves. i will not be back though. the cruddy waitress might have been a fluke because the service i had the first time for brunch was fine but the food here is just that bad brunch is acceptable but late night dinner was the worst management, if you are reading this. i would be happy to revisit your restaurant but only after you inform me that you have fired your previous cooks and hired new ones. on top of that, please retrain your entire staff. teach them the damn basics like how to greet guests at the door and seat them, how to clean a table, how to give out menus, how to listen properly, how to make sure a patron's food arrives on time"
2072,,1125,3,9/16/17,"toulouse petit is famous for its happy hour, so here we were on sunday night, sep ,  at  pm sharp to see what it is all about. there was no wait and we sat ourselves in the loungebar area, and the meal begins. service was excellent. when asked for recommendations, the waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. he did forget to bring us a spoon for soup , and gave us lamb sliders stead of beef, but he remedied these issues professionally and prompty. ambience is casual with dark lighting and rustic furniture. overall very clean and fitting with the food being serviced.  for service and ambience. for food, we ordered  dishes to share between the two of us, as follows french onion soup - light and tasty -  beef sliders with fries - a bit dry -  clams with leeks - way too salty, and bread was stale -  escargot or snails - simple but very delicious -  fried chicken with gravy - salty but not flavorful -  barbeque shrimp - good but forgettable -  food was over seasoned, underwhelming and inconsistent. while the menu was impressive, the execution fell short of expectations.  for food. overall, the rating is a solid  based on reasons above. food was a disappointment during my visit, but i will come back to try again."
2073,,1125,4,5/15/17,"i've usually come for brunch, and have always had incredible food. during brunch, i've done the madam croquette and a couple different hashes. stopped in for happy hour and had the french onion soup , and buttermilk chicken bites. the husband had the andouille soup . we tried  different cocktails, i had the katie mae, and the madame toulouse which were bitter and crisp in a good way. hubs had pendennis club and silver lining--which was by far our favorite. if you do not order the buttermilk chicken bites you are seriously missing out."
2074,,1125,5,4/5/17,"had lunch yesterday on tuesday, april nd for restaurant week work luncheon.  food was incredible, service was great, and the four of us had a great time.  i had the beet and haricot vert salad.  it was one of the best things i have ever ate.  it had golden beets, green beans, kalamata olives, hazelnuts, blue cheesegorgonzola -  amazing.  the jambalaya was good, i added a little hot sauce, and it was loaded with chicken and sausage.  for dessert, i had the biegnets, which are good, but the chicory anglais served with it takes it to another level.  others at the table raved about the french onion soup and fried green tomatoes.  the ice cream served with the brioche bread pudding was fantastic.  this is my third time eating here, and it has been awesome every time.  my only criticism is that since it is a new orleans influenced place, they should play some jazz instead of top ."
2075,,1125,5,1/2/17,"came in tonight for a birthday dinner tonight and had a tremendous experience kyle was attentive and his suggestions kicked ass natalie, a manager, came to visit our table and personally bestowed birthday wishes this menu is insane. ask for suggestions, come hungry. sriracha shrimp shrimp with tasso and roasted garlic fried bacon oysters kilpatrick thanks kyle for the suggestion cheese plate pork cheeks wild boar sausage on baguette french onion soup prosciutto wrapped asparagus fried green tomatoes with crab and remoulade shrimp, andouille and crawfish over grits steak frites lamp shoulder ragu seared scallops with mushroom risotto pecan pie with bourbon vanilla ice cream the birthday boy wanted to order some late night happy hour po-boys but i think we would had enough. one of the most epic meals i've ever had. nailed it."
2076,,1125,4,12/5/16,"low lit, mellow atmosphere. hard to read menu in this setting and it also did not help that the font choice was skinny. a vast choice for food, but my hot date and i opted for a  prix fixe meal to share. no dessert is included in the set three course meal. you have a choice of a starter, a small plate, then the main dinner entree. what we ordered - french onion soup  hit the spot on a cold evening, great flavors and textures, very cheesy -savory crawfish beignets delicious i always have a hankering for beignets so i knew i had to have some form of them here. first time having them in the savory form and can say that they were bursting with great taste the sauce had a slight kick, but was more pleasant. -lamb shoulder ragu the waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen split this dish for us into two separate bowls. we were not charged for it later either. not too gamy and seasoned well. pasta was a little al dente, but i did not mind this too much."
2077,,1125,4,12/1/16,"been here a few times and my most recent was right after they opened after receiving a piss poor grade from the city food inspectors. knowing me, your food are not good unless the kitchen is dirty. i'm serious, the best food in the world is always cooked by the hole in the walls. sorry, that fine dining shit is for snobs with their noses up in the air.  if your stomach cannot handle it, cry me a river and work on your immune system game. i'm going to base this review on my most recent visit.  came here with a party of  for lunch and was seated immediately. waitress was quick and efficient.  food came quick as well.  i like rabbit but decided to go with something more plain. i opted for the spicy jambalaya, french onion soup and the beignets.  the food was just meh.quite regular and nothing special.  i found the jambalaya too spicy and i so hated how they just pre-dunk my baguette in the onion soup .  next time i will have to tell them to put it on the side. overall, always had a positive experience here. i feel like the food is a hit or miss. i do like to come here at night because the rustic interior reminds me of interview with a vampire featuring brad pitt and tom cruise.  toulouse petit was quite the meat market back in the day, if you are into that scene, but who is not  i do not frequent queen anne too often so things might be different now."
2078,,1125,2,11/4/16,"my experience at toulouse petit for dinner was mixed. first of all, the place was packed. as another reviewer shared, be patient -- this is a place to go to enjoy a meal leisurely, so if you are in a rush for a quick meal, i would not recommend going here. i feel like the restaurant is understaffed for such a busy place. could have been that someone called out that night, but we noticed that the poor hostess needed to frequently kick in and help serve. she was extremely nice and accommodating to the extent to which she could be at such a busy time. the other servers were fine -- again, there were just not enough of them, and it was tough to get things like water at the table. food-wise we both did the prix-fixe menu, which was a lot of food, so maybe think twice unless you are super hungry i started with the french onion soup . it took a while to get our first dishes, and when my soup came out, it was kind of lukewarm rather than hot, but otherwise really good my friend had the toulouse springtime market salad with a champagne vinaigrette that was delicious. i then had the eggplant caponata bruschetta with prosciutto, and this is where service problems got a bit worse. my friend had the same thing, but without prosciutto -- they brought out both without prosciutto, and it took quite a long time to bring the prosciutto out. when i finally got it, our main courses came out about  minutes later. so by the time i finished my bruschetta, my next course -- steak frites -- was also warm rather than hot. but the eggplant caponata was fantastic. the steak frites were only okay. both were ridiculously over salted -- the sauce on the steak as well as the frites themselves. i left a lot of that dish on the plate. my friend had the tagliatelle with mushrooms and said it was excellent. finally, we shared a dessert -- the ice cream and brownie sundae. definitely to be shared. a few bites were enough -- it is delicious, particularly the caramel and fudge sauces that come on the side. another problem coffee. had a coffee come out in an individual french press. i poured the first cup, and my cup filled with grounds. the hostess was extremely nice and went to get another one -- again, it just took a while. so by the time i got my coffee, we were ready to go. so that is what i mean by mixed. would i try this place again yes. intrigued by the brunch offerings. but i wish i could rave like some of the other reviewers did."
2079,,1125,4,9/4/16,"the atmosphere is fun and trendy, and the drinks are awesome. service was ok and the food took a while to come out. i had a quick lunch with just the mozzarella en crudo with heirloom tomatoes salad and the french onion soup . the salad might have been the best caprese style salad i have ever had. the pesto, mozzarella, arugula and tomatoes were very fresh and flavorful. the small size was also very filling. i cannot say that i enjoyed the french onion soup at all. it was very bland and tasted mostly of the bread inside it. the bartender said they do not usually get complaints on it so i assume it was a bad batch i will give it another shot next time because i will be back. i will finish my cava with elderflower liqueur and get back to you."
2080,,1125,4,8/17/16,"great, lively atmosphere i think this place has the most candles i have ever seen. service was a little slow since they were so busy. i recommend making reservations beforehand. the menu is huge. everything looked so great. the prix fixe dinner is a great chance to try several things for a pretty reasonable price of ~ for  courses. to start i got the french onion soup which was good but did not really stand out to me. the crawfish beignets were amazing really unique texture and flavors. i could eat a ton of these as a meal. for the entree i got the pan seared diver scallops with truffle risotto. the scallops were perfectly cooked and the risotto was really savory. overall i really enjoyed coming here and would love to try other things on their menu."
2081,,1125,5,8/8/16,"it was so good the last time i went, i had to go again before we leave seattle.  it was just as good as the first time if possible, maybe better.  this time, my wife did not like the french onion soup as well, but, oh, my the rest of the meal.  i started with the sweetbreads, which i love to order wherever i can find them.  these were over the top good - breaded and deep fried and served with a couple of cajun sauces one red, one green that were delightfully spicy.  and the size  how about eleven sweetbreads in a  order.  seriously  that is huge  they really should put a half order on the menu if they are going to serve this much.  next came the jambalaya, which was wonderful.  five shrimp, lots of andouille and mounds of chicken.  if anything, there could have been more rice as the sauteed vegetables were primarily the remainder of the dish, with the rice coming in a distant fourth in quantity.  for an entree, my wife had the halibut.  she said it was quite possibly the best fish dish she has had in her entire life.  excellent compliment of asparagus, a bit of sherry in the sauce for a hint of sweetness, and lots of chopped pistachios.  as good as the food is, the service staff is even better.  from the hostess to other waitresses to our waiter, they are gorgeous, personable, and incredibly adept at what they do and are supposed to do.  just an amazing experience.  one suggestion to the management, though - ditch the playlist and pipe new orleans jazz into the room.  that would totally complete the experience."
2082,,1125,5,8/28/15,"great place for happy hour our waitress was amazing, i asked her opinion on a couple items and she helped us with several suggestions to get us going. when it came to selecting a drink i just told her to pick one for me because it was clear she had great taste and it was a super yummy drink she selected for me. for two people, we shared classic shrimp creole manila clams with spanish chorizo buttermilk fries chicken bites crawfish beignets with hot pepper jelly dessert was toulouse bananas foster and trio of creme brulee. the desserts were just okay, but the dishes were all ones i would recommend."
2083,,1125,4,11/4/12,"nice ambience came here for the happy hour on sunday. arrived at pm and was not too crowded yet. it got crowded later in the night. fried chicken gumbo - fried chicken was amazing. very flavorful. fried green tomatoes with remoulade - i always have to order fried green tomatoes if its on the menu. this was nice and crispy. yellow beets and haricots verts with toasted walnuts and stilton bleu cheese - it was ok. duck and pork rillettes - surprisingly good classic shrimp creole - i do not think im on a fan of creole. crab ravigote over fried green tomatoes - pretty good but i just really like the tomatoes. buttermilk fried chicken bites - good comes with a biscuit and mashed potatoes. staple. cajun meatloaf sliders pommes frites with aioli - this was pretty good, i do not usually like sliders. buttermilk beignets - yum toulouse bananas foster - very sweet. this dish was surprisingly large compared to the other dishes."
2084,,1125,5,5/4/12,"the happy hour menu is delightfully confusing - so many options. i had chicken & shrimp jambalaya - delicious spicy lamb sliders - amazing fried oysters wremoulades - absolutely delicious toulouse bananas foster - divine everything was outstanding, including the service  although, it is rather loud in there during happy hour - but i suppose it cannot be helped.  street parking is also a b* -- i got a ticket for parking in a permit zone around the corner, even though the sign that marked it as a permit zone was behind my parking spot.  go figure. i cannot wait to go back and try more."
2085,,1125,5,1/16/12,"upon the suggestion of the concierge in our hotel, we enjoyed a wonderful evening of celebration at this restaurant. we could not have chosen a better place. the atmosphere is urban and trendy without being pretentious hard to pull off, the food is inovative yet understandable, and the staff is one of the most friendly in the city. everything on the menu looked yummy, but we started with the dungeness crab over fried green tomatoes and the seafood 'nola' salad with dungeness crab and gulf shrimp. both of these were great choices, piled high with the fresh crab. for dinner the highlight was the grilled fall king salmon with chanterelle and wild mushroom jus, a simple yet flavorful preparation of the salmon. for dessert we chose a couple of old-school ones that have been updated perfectly toulouse bananas foster and white chocolate bread pudding. the restaurant is not large, so reservations are suggested. we loved the decor, especially the iron lighting scultpures that we were told was done by a former bartender. the gm stopped by the table and shared a laugh and a wine suggestion, and it was resonable and really good. the bonus, though, is that this restaurant uses local, sustainable ingredients. by the way, the floor to ceiling windows have a perfect view of the space needle."
2086,,1125,4,5/3/10," killer happy hour options - yellow beet salad with haricots verts, stilton blue cheese and toasted walnuts .] also contains olives, onions and light herbs - so many flavors & healthy - fried chicken gumbo .] dark brown gumbo with  pieces of fried chicken on top and andouille, rice, lentils you eat this one with a fork - its spicy hot but delicious - 'barbecued' shrimp new orleans .]  shrimp served on grits yeah] with a hot, spiced sauce - this i loved. - toulouse bananas foster .] just order this, girlfriend - spice cake in the middle, surrounded by  slices of banana in an orange rum flambe, candied pecans plus vanilla ice cream, which melts & cuts through the syrup - yum. notes the happy hours fill up fast so plan on arriving early  seats at the bar] i like the interior -- tables with beautiful wood designs, candles on each table, the ornate orange art deco hanging lights, the gold-blue- brown plaster walls, the big east-facing windows though the bar stools do not have backs the ceiling is high & thus it can get loud fast. you are on your own for parking the staff is certainly helpful and attentive my server dominique was a peach."
2087,,1125,4,8/24/17,"this place was recommended by our airbnb host after getting to seattle pretty late from new york. we went here for a late night dinner after p. i had no idea this place was so popular. since we came late, the restaurant was busy but not too crowded. i could imagine the long wait during brunch times. cauliflower and leek vichyssoise soup with dungeness crab - this was the best soup i have ever had. it was creamy, but still tasted light because of the cauliflower . adding the dungeness crab made the soup even more perfect. the bowl is kind of small. i wish i could have gotten a bigger bowl of it, especially since my boyfriend could not stop taking spoonfuls of my soup . muschovy duck and pistachio terrine - the terrine did not really taste like duck, but it was delicious. i never had this kind of cold jellied meat before and it was an interesting texture. the crunchiness from the pistachio in it was great. wild pacific shrimp and housemade andouille with crawfish over creamy corn grits - i loved the creamy grits the best. there was lots of flavor in the tomato based stew of shrimp, sausage, and crawfish. there was surprisingly a decent amount of crawfish meat. crawfish beignets with hot pepper jelly - this was the only thing we did not like. they were less like beignets and more like fritters. it did not have any taste of shellfish and had a weird fake texture. the hot pepper jelly was an interesting complement though. i never had creole food from new orleans, but the food here was incredibly delicious. we were going to try to come back again to get more of the vichyssoise soup but unfortunately did not have time. i would visit seattle again just to come back here. i can see why it has over  reviews."
2088,,1125,5,9/26/16,"their brunch is delicious and i love their happy hour they even have a brunch happy hour  for most breakfast dishes. their late night happy hour is amazing but the dishes are a bit small so do not expect a meal after order one dish. i absolutely love love love the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab  the fried chicken gumbo is a popular pick that is also available during happy hour. my go to if i'm hungry is the catfish po' boy. so yummy it is served with crispy thin herb fries that are so addictive. if you are looking for dessert, beignets are pretty bomb. just a fluffy little donut with a chicory sauce. if you love happy hour and love creole food not too many restaurants with creole food in the area then this your place oh, and be patient on the weekends long waits are expected. weekday happy hour is pretty easy to find a table though."
2089,,1125,4,6/6/16,"order their prefix for only .  their fried green tomato with dungeness crab was just fantastic i also recommend ordering their cauliflower soup with dungeness crab soup .  their jambalaya was delicious, just the right spice and kick. do make rsvp for dinner especially during the weekend as we experienced, they were super packed  this is a great place to have a nice dinner for two, or a fun get together with a large group.  staff was super and made great recommendations until then, be kind to one another and cheers ~ p"
2090,,1125,4,4/24/16,"toulouse petit was our first stop upon arriving at seattle. we got to the restaurant at  but staff told us lunch starts at . the nice waitress allowed us to sit for - minutes while drinking coffee and browsing the menu. coincidentally, it was restaurant week. trying out the -course  lunch was a no brainer. i had the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab and the wild boar bolognese. both dishes were tasteful and wonderfully prepared. the portion was perfect for lunch and we left satisfied. definitely coming back here in the future"
2091,,1125,5,1/29/16,"what a great happy hour hands down the best happy hour menu i have seen, and rightfully so, looks like they have lots of credit for having the best happy hour.  happy hour here gets busy so get here early. i came in for the late night hh. i tried the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab , and it is to die for delicious. i also ordered the tuna tartare, and was not a fan neither were my friends and it remained untouched. my friend ordered he beignets and they are a yummy treat. i'm a sucker for the curious stats on the menu listing tid-bits like how many candles they light each night and how many glass tiles were used."
2092,,1125,4,1/6/16,"love this place. the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab was so amazing, i got it twice in  days. best gnocchi i've ever had. super yummy red beans and rice, although not comparable to new orleans. the only reason i would not give this place  stars is because the desserts were mediocre to say the least, and i questioned if they were even made in house. the decor was stunning."
2093,,1125,3,12/28/15,"this is one of those seattle spots that has staying power. i do not visit frequently, but when i do or walkdrive by in the neighborhood, it always seems to be packed from morning to late night. met up with former colleagues for a post-christmas lunch and had to patiently wait for a booth to open up since they do not take reservations. lunch hours are am - pm daily. toulouse petit has a lengthy menu, but a decent variety offering soups , salads, small plates, burgers, sandwiches, entrees, or a two course prix fixe lunch. loud, busy, and all tables, booths, and the bar was full of customers as expected. to escape the cold, we just jammed ourselves by the entrancehost booth, others overflowed onto the sidewalk. it was in the range of a - minute wait for a booth to open up. jmc ordered an iced tea to go with his two course prix fixe selection  of cauliflower soup with dungeness crab and the wild boar bolognese over tagliatelle. that is a great deal since separately these two items would have cost  more. looked tasty, but the tagliatelle looked thinner more like linguine. for the latter, my go to is usually from volterra. cb decided on a glass of white wine to go with her blt with avocado  which came with pommes frites and a garlic herb aioli. quite an abundant serving. i needed my taste buds to get fired up, so i selected the shrimp and chicken jambalaya with homemade andouille sausage  with ample refills of ice water. very generous serving with five plump shrimp, cubes of chicken, and slices of spicy sausage. protein thumbs up, the rice was seasoned and sauced nicely with onions and peppers. just wished for a bit less sauce and more toothsome rice. this is enough to split or to box up half to take home. decent, but i still prefer this signature dish from where ya at matt or roux. service was well paced, unobtrusive, and one did not feel compelled to rush through the meal to turn the table over which is greatly appreciated. i was here primarily for the company, food was sufficient if you have a cajuncreole craving when in seattle's queen anneuptown neighborhood."
2094,,1125,4,1/22/15,"fantastic meal and atmosphere we came here for my mom's birthday dinner and the food + atmosphere did not disappoint. we had reservations and waited a few for the table to be cleared for us, no biggie. however, waiting for the waitress to take our order was a little be of a let down. there were tables open, so seeing as it is not as busy as it regularly is, i take one star off. the meal in itself was great terrine and rillettes are not something often come by in sf, so we ordered both the duck and chicken liver terrine* and the duck and chicken rillettes to start. great appetizers and what would usually fill me up, was equally shared and enjoyed with the gf and i. i ordered the three course prix fixe for the main courses. for starters the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab was great, sea is known for it is seafood, so this was definitely a go to. the crawfish begniet were great i would highly recommend these, the chili sauce was reminiscent of the chili sauce usually served at filipino parties accompanying lumpia. the rib eye was as delicious and def a go to, as i do love my beef entrees. for dessert, we shared the madeline sundae, the port reduction and lemon gelato were fantastic, a great way to top off the stomach. i would come here again, and if the service improves, i will give it a  star, but for now  stars is pretty accurate."
2095,,1125,4,4/8/14,"just under a year ago, i was in nola. i came here expecting to get some of the same creole style cooking. i was not disappointed at all shrimp and chicken jambalaya - . i was worried that this jambalaya would not measure up to my expectations, but i was dead wrong. strong spice from the pepper, hearty portions of shrimp, sausage slices and chicken in a cast-iron skillet cannot go wrong. crispy fried chicken gumbo - . not quite as thick as the gumbo i had back down in nola, but this still had the strong, powerful flavors i remember. the fried chicken was a lovely touch added into the gumbo, not on the side and it is crunchy texture served as a great contrast to the soup . crawfish beignets with red pepper chow chow - . this caught my eye since i had not heard of beignets being done in the savory fashion. it turns out this is quite similar to hush puppies rather than cafe du monde beignets. cauliflower soup with dungeness crab - . creamy, but light - this cauliflower soup was a great starter. would gladly order this again if i'm looking for something that does not have the strong punch of the other dishes. french onion soup lyonnaise - . unfortunately, this was a miss. nothing wrong with the way the dish was cooked, but it just did not resonate with my tastes."
2096,,1125,4,10/18/13,"i've only been to toulouse petit twice and have been pleased both times. the first time was a few months ago, went with a few friends pretty late in the evening. the ambience was pleasant along with the service. i believe i had the lamb burger with fries great fries and pretty much inhaled the entire thing from start-to-finish. the second time was just a couple days ago for srw seattle restaurant week. lunch was not too crazy busy. i was surprised since their promotional menu offers great eats middle of the day on wednesday. started with the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab , then the wild boar bolognese as my entree, and finally, beignets with chicory anglaise. what a perfect portion i did not feel cheated with srw. nor was flavor or appearance compromised. nonetheless, there is a variety of food all hours of the day, extensive drinks menu, and pretty decent service."
2097,,1125,3,9/27/13,"i'm either getting highly cynical of places or just experiencing some seriously legit bites in other cities, but seattle is starting to let me down with some of its gems. this is such a highly reviewed place that i've been dying to try for a while now, so my husband took me for a fun dinner the other night. we did show up early and it was still happy hour, so the bar was chock full of people taking advantage of the cheaper small plates and discounted drinks - more power to them in hindsight, we should have canceled our dinner res and moved to the bar area because the dinner was definitely lacking due to the attention placed on the bar folk. that being said, we did three courses each and none of the dishes were out of this world. we had the califlower soup with dungeness , one of the salads, boar sausage, prawns and then the lamb pasta dish and seafood medley in marinara sauce. i am disappointed to say that the best dish was actually the lamb papardelle dish and i ended up eating my husbands because it was not even tasty enough for him to devour the entire thing which is usually what happens.  we opted out of dessert and left feeling less than satisfied. i expected more from the cocktails and food, but have to admit i like the interior. candles were a nice touch and they had sports playing. always a plus. but, when going there for a nice, romantic dinner the ambiance did not play well to it. the space is too small to pull off the casual bar setting and also a more upscale dining experience."
2098,,1125,4,9/21/13,"on a random evening, my friends and i ended up here for night-time happy hour. get there early, because the seats get filled up really quickly. or perhaps do reservations - it is probably smarter that way. my trip to this place was about  months ago, so i apologize if i cannot really recall what we ate  buttermilk fried chicken bites with tasso  cauliflower soup with dungeness crab  toulouse beef sliders and some more. i can definitely tell you that the soup was super delicious. nice little joint to have some good food and drinks at night."
2099,,1125,4,6/5/13,"we came in right before happy hour, which starts at pm, and sat at the bar. they have an hour between lunch and dinner p-p where you cannot order food, so it was pretty empty when we got there. the bartender was very personable and friendly, we got our drinks fast. we ordered food at exactly pm. i got fried okra, the duck and chicken terrine, and the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab off the happy hour menu. the cauliflower soup was delicious, sized perfectly and only . the fried over was sliced longwise, not in little circles as you would expect. it was ok as far as okra goes. the duck and chicken liver terrine which is essentially pate was excellent, and came with little croustinis. my husband ordered the sliders, which were great as well. he also ordered the asparagus, which was , and when it came we both looked at each other in complete surprise. there were  small stems of asparagus we could not believe it. the bartender we started with left right after pm for the dinner shift switch, and our new bartender was very nice as well."
2100,,1125,5,11/11/12,"i love you toulouse. first of all let us give you a run down of what i ate when i went here for lunch with my friend. -beignets with their chicory anglaise sauce. which was like sweet syrupy coffee, in a totally good way. extremely addictive to say the least. - cauliflower soup with dungeness crab -housemade ricotta gnocchi. they were all absolutely delicious. seriously, i was sitting there in the bar, my friend and i making such inappropriate noises due to the tastiness of the food. not to mention they do breakfast happy hour, which i will be needing to take part in on my next visit."
2101,,1125,5,10/22/12,"the first night when we arrived in seattle, despite the rain of course, we had our first late night meal at toulouse petit  yum yum yum  their happy hour was amazing, so please be sure to call in to check what the times are.  their happy hour menu was extensive.  just thinking about it makes me want to fly back to seattle for some more  here is a peek at the menu toulousepetit.comwp-con. i highly recommend their cauliflower soup with dungeness crab   i am not a cauliflower fan, but i am totally a crab fan so that was enough reasons for me to try out this soup .  i have to admit that the combination was such a surprise and really warms up your tummy on a cold day.  it is definitely a great starter to any meal  i also recommend the 'sinister' fried pacific shrimp, toulouse beef sliders, and the crispy fried pork cheeks confit  basically, try everything that we tried and then try some more. amazing  if i could make it a tradition to stop by toulouse petit on the first next of every seattle trip, this means that i will have an amazing seattle trip every time "
2102,,1125,4,10/21/12,"been here several times for happy hour and dinner and have always been happy with the food, drinks and service.  hhs are awesome here - there is a reason why it is in the top ten.  have had beet salad - very yummy, from someone who recoils at the thought of beets cauliflower soup with dungeness crab - very good, even though i'm not even a big fan of cream-based soups manila clams with spanish chorizo - a wonky combination of flavors, but for someone who likes both clams and chorizo, i loved it sinister shrimp and bbq shrimp any of the sliders . but really, people - why come to this place for sliders the cocktails are also incredible and the service very good.  we have also never had any problems finding parking, despite the fact that it is lower queen anne.  wish this was closer to my 'hood - would love to be able to walk here for a quick bite more often"
2103,,1125,4,12/27/11,"what a fun place to visit, and the food's great to. we had a wonderful waitress, who was both unintrustive and added to the experience of fun that was being had.perfect. toulouse petit does not have a petit menu, but the food is well prepared. our waitstaff was quite opinionated and advised us on what was tasty and what should be avoided. i personally had the  prix fixe menu, with a couple of glasses of wine and the beignets for appetizer. tried the cauliflower soup with dungeness crab wonderful, the fried green tomatoes with seafood topping lovely, and the steak frites, also perfectly accomplished. the restaurant is really hoppin' these days, making for a vibrant social scene which adds to the experience. overall, i will plan to repeat, just as much for the experience as for the food."
2104,,1125,5,8/11/11,"i still cannot believe how amazing the food and drinks are for happy hour. amazing flavors with everything my boyfriend and i ordered. he got - escargot with garlic and fresh herbs  i never had escargots before and knowing what they are i was a little squeamish. but lucky for me, my boyfriend handed me his balls not literally, that is just weird and i tried one. wow delicious - foie gras i did not try it for personal reasons, but my boyfriend enjoyed it a lot since the first bite he ate with his eyes closed and he was quiet the whole time the plate was in front of him. -  oysters made  different ways i had the one with spinach and cheese on top and it was awesome not sure what the other  had on top but they looked good and according to boyfriend, they were amazing. - bbq shrimp with grits tip from the bartender and glad he followed. the shrimp was perfectly cooked and the grits perfectly made. mind you, i do not like grits. at all. i did not even knew they were grits when i looked at the plate, i thought it was mashed potatoes so i took a little bite. at first i thought hm.gritty mashed.weird.but tastes alright. boyfriend saw my confused face and filled me in that it was grits i was eating and i was pleasantly surprised.  i had - cauliflower soup with dungeness crab  creamy deliciousness with lots of crab , amazing. - english pea, artichoke, white truffel bruschetta mmmm really really good. i also had the madame toulouse ' cocktail, which was again, delicious. no surprise the place fills up quick. we were there on a tuesday around pm and it filled up pretty quickly after pm so i think it is best to make a reservation. delicious food, friendly bartender, awesome people. love love love"
2105,,1125,4,5/12/17,"impromptu date night to the chris brown concert landed my hubby and i here for hh before the show. i was able to snag a table in the bar quite easily while my hubby looked for parking. the waitress who greeted me was very nice. i asked her what she would recommend off their cocktail menu that was not too sweet and refreshing. she recommended the katie mae, which sounded like a martini made with vodka, elderflower liqueur, grapefruit, and topped with sparkling wine. i rolled with it since i never had elderflower liqueur before. the katie mae arrived and it tasted great. my hubby was still looking for parking so i went ahead and ordered food while i waited for him. i ordered the * fried chicken bites w black pepper tasso gravy * bbq would shrimp new orleans * crawfish beignets w hot pepper jelly * spicy lamb sliders w pomme frites by the time my hubby got to the restaurant the food was already coming out so he was lucky he did not have to wait long to eat. he ordered the voodoo rum punch to try. unfortunately he was not a fan. it tasted more like rum and pineapple only. you could not taste the other things in the cocktail like the ginger beer. i was personally bummed because i like ginger beer, oh well. the fried chicken bites were good. the pieces were not oily and were the perfect size. the gravy had a kick, but i felt the dish as a whole could of used more salt. the shrimp was by far my favorite dish. big shrimp pieces accompanied by cheesy grits. lots of flavor in this dish alone. the crawfish beignets were delicious. good sized, the ratio between the crawfish and dough was good, and it had lots of flavor. the hot pepper jelly added a nice sweet and spicy kick to the dish. the spicy lamb sliders were ok. i was not a fan of the bun choice and the lamb patty was slightly dry, but had good flavor. the sliders were served with pomme frites and aioli. loved the pomme fries. they were nice and crispy. just how i love my fries. hh overall was great. the menu is expansive and reasonably priced. we just booked a trip to new orleans not too long ago so it will be nice to see how toulouse's food compares to the food there."
2106,,1125,5,5/11/17,"everyone seems to rave about their brunch but i've never been. i've been here during their early happy hour though -pm and it is pretty good. - crawfish beignets with hot pepper jelly . if you did not tell me that it has crawfish in it, i would have mistaken it for a crab cake with really good spicy sauce drizzled on it. - buttermilk fried chicken bites with tasso - black pepper gravy . this tasted so good. it does not say but it comes with mash potatoes and the gravy complemented the chicken and mashed potatoes really well. - spicy lamb sliders . with pommes frites with aioli additional   . i did not get to try the sliders because i was pigging out on the fried chicken bites and the fries. their pommes frites with aioli was really flavorful and tasted really good my happy hour partner gobbled up both the sliders and said it was good and juicy tasting. yeah, when i'm in the area i will go here again for happy hour"
2107,,1125,5,3/4/17,"during our visit to seattle, a number of people recommended this location to us for happy hour and we certainly understand why -- the food was good, the selection was extensive and the service was friendly and quick. its a little bit pricey for portion sizes ex. the mushroom bruschetta was delicious but was  for one serving but the food is inventive and flavorful.  in addition to the mushroom bruschetta, we had spicy lamb sliders and brussel sprouts both that we would recommend. we will definitely be back for the sliders they are an especially good deal if you add the pomme frites for  and to try out more dishes on their menu"
2108,,1125,4,8/22/15,"happy hour is one my favorite things. i cannot imagine living somewhere where happy hour is banned like boston. i'm sure that late afternoon productivity is higher in places with happy hour, because it is easier to work hard at the end of the day knowing that cheap drinks and small plates are just a short time away. toulouse petit proudly promotes itself as having one of the ten best happy hours in the nation according to a cnbc survey, so my girlfriend and i decided to check it out a few fridays ago. the happy hour menu at toulouse petit is impressive in its breadth. they offer over fifty different food items and a wide arrays of cocktails, beer, and wine. to start with, we ordered a voodoo rum punch and a glass of sangria. they were each  which is not a great happy hour price. however, they were pretty tasty. in the true new orleans style, the drinks were overly sweet and on the strong side which almost justifies the higher price. we tried several dishes from their menu frisee salad with a poached hen egg  -  this salad was basically ham and eggs large chunks of tasso with the hen egg with some frisee hiding underneath. although many people might see that as a positive, i felt that the tasso overpowered the other parts of the dish to the point where the frisee almost seemed like a garnish. buttermilk fried chicken bites with tasso-black pepper gravy  - this was our favorite selection. the chicken was well-seasoned, had crisp breading, and was juicy inside. the gravy complemented the chicken and mashed potatoes well. spicy lamb sliders with pommes frites  - the sliders were cooked just right and seasoned aggressively. all of the ingredients were top notch individually, but i'm not sure that they worked well together. the fries were decent but not special. this was not the most memorable dish. overall, we liked everything we tried during happy hour at toulouse petit, but there was not any dish or drink that i feel like i absolutely must have again, especially when our total bill came up to ~. while they should definitely be commended for having such an extensive happy hour selection, i do not think it is that great of a happy hour. i would not rank it in my personal top ten and certainly not in the top ten nationwide."
2109,,1125,4,3/25/13,"went here for early hh before a concert at the key the bar area was rather small during and during hh it was crowded just standing to find a spot. so i would recommend getting there early to ensure you find a spot. we ordered the fried oysters but the batter was extremely thick and its was chewy. will defiantly not get this again. we also had a fed other items, some that stand out were shrimp and grits were awesome simple awesome. texture of the grits was just right, also shrimp had great flavor and were larger than i had expected. and for desert we had an order of the beignet. on the other hand we had a few thing we did not enjoy so much manila clams - was okay, but i've had much better elsewhere. flavor was lacking spicy lamb sliders - not a fan. there was something about it that i could not really put my finger on."
2110,,1125,4,2/12/13,"i visited toulouse petit for happy hour after a matinee at mccaw hall. at , the bar area where happy hour is served was already packed the rest of the restaurant was nearly empty. we were able to find a table without walking around like vultures for too long, but since we were  people at a  top we ended up sharing with two other ladies. the happy hour menu is extensive and well-priced. we shared the mussels with saffron and mustard which our waitress recommended as her favorite among the  musselclam choices. we were not disappointed, they were flavorful and came with toasted baguette perhaps a little too toasted as it was difficult to break which we dipped in the sauce this made it softer. my friend had never tasted escargot so we ordered those as well which were spiced differently than i had, had in the past. they were a nice change. lastly we ordered the spicy lamb sliders with pommes frites. the sliders were nicely spiced, and not in the hot- spicy way that overpowers all the flavors. the pommes frites are typical frites style and i would honestly come here just to eat them. as a bonus the ladies next to us gave us a large portion of their pommes frites as they had ordered them as a side. drinks were also good. there was a nice selection of house drinks on the happy hour menu although a little pricey at . they were well worth it. my first drink could have used a little more time in the boston shaker, but i would not have noticed if i had not tried my friend's well-chilled in comparison drink. i will definitely be back as soon as possible. too bad the breakfast happy hour is only mon-fri when i work."
2111,,1125,5,5/4/12,"the happy hour menu is delightfully confusing - so many options. i had chicken & shrimp jambalaya - delicious spicy lamb sliders - amazing fried oysters wremoulades - absolutely delicious toulouse bananas foster - divine everything was outstanding, including the service  although, it is rather loud in there during happy hour - but i suppose it cannot be helped.  street parking is also a b* -- i got a ticket for parking in a permit zone around the corner, even though the sign that marked it as a permit zone was behind my parking spot.  go figure. i cannot wait to go back and try more."
2112,,1125,3,6/17/10,"we made it after waiting for my girl to get off work we got to toulouse just in time to get some eats   am. so we met up with the other girls who were already waiting, there was a huge crowd outside of toulouse and peso is and random men trying to introduce themselves to us. sorry bro , got to eat ambiance . a+  i like the decor, the tiles on the floor, all the candles on the wall, the place beams like the temples i have visited in thailand lol .must be a pain to take them all down though  anywhooos the menu is endless. there were so many dishes to chose from. * spicy lamb sliders w fites. -  but there were no spice at all and the frites were a bit too oily. like i got the bottom of  whatever is left batch or the frites. * toulouse steak tartare that came with a yolk on top.- it was pretty good but fell apart more easily than others i've tried. * i ordered three different cheeses to try from. the favorite of the three i ordered would  be the flirt. and last but not least, we shared the ice cream w valhrona brownie sundae. . omg  also, our waitress was great she was knowledgable and answered all of our questions and gave good suggestions. i am dying to try to brunch, so i will update this review some other time"
2113,,1125,4,6/9/10,"okay. i put off writing this review for toulouse petit until i could try it out a handful of times and really get a feel for the place. i must proclaim i enjoy t.p. potty joke and the service has been impeccable each time i have visited. on breakfast a lot of people are of the opinion that a restaurant should pick a few dishes to make really well for their menu but i am the most indecisive person during brunch time so i genuinely welcome the extensive menu options here. cons i will say for the price i was not too impressed with the portion size of the blue crab benedict and on the day i ate that plate it was under-seasoned and the breakfast potatoes were soggy and undercooked. pros the 'city's best fruit plate' lives up to its name and the fluffy beignets are a table must. the caramel french toast is delightful although i have recently suppressed my inner five year old from ordering such desserts for breakfast anymore. anything with kurobuta ham andouille sausage will be delicious. i heart the french press coffee but a good bloody will always keep me coming back for more on happy hour -pm & pm-am the self-proclamation best happy hour late night menu in the nation is a little irksome but with over  light bites priced under  i cannot say i disagree with toulouse. cons do not ask what is on tap because they get it all the time- they only have bottle beers, wine, and spirits folks. also the music can get a little peso-ish i.e. now that is what i call chad jamz  at night time but at least here you will not have someone grinding up against you while you are eating. pros too many great dishes to list but barbecued shrimp, spicy lamb sliders , fried chicken, and the crab ravigote over fried green tomatoes are amongst my favorites. summary i know this place gets a lot of bad hype because of the owner's responses to reviews but i would not let what others tell you deter you from checking it out yourself. the atmosphere is really lovely, the wait time is nearly non-existent even on the weekends, and everyone who has ever waited on me has been a total doll. this is starting to become one of my default late night food spots."
2114,,1125,5,5/11/10,"before i launch into my shamelessly glowing review, i must enthusiastically and wholeheartedly attest to gayot's naming of toulouse petit as one of the top new dining destinations  local.msn.comarticle.as. . in the country i would not know. but i have no qualms about saying that if you live in the state or are in town for a visit, get your butt over here. pronto everything we ordered was outstanding . yellow beet salad w haricots verts, stilton, and toasted walnuts chunks, not slices, of beets crisp beans perfectly dressed . crispy fried pork cheeks confit lean, toothsome meat especially loved the accompanying pickled shallots and apple compote . barbecued shrimp new orleans extra-creamy grits were omg good . crab ravigote on fried green tomatoes nice contrast texture-wise, both components were fresh and flavorful . fried chicken w tasso and black pepper gravy sorry, ezell's, i've cheated and this will not be the last time served with luxuriously smooth whipped potatoes and a tiny, scrumptious biscuit . spicy lamb sliders juicy meat, generous helpings of caramelized onions, some of the best frites in seattle . white chocolate bread pudding served warm and saucy loved the firm texture of the bread, wanted to lick the dish clean . bananas foster one of my favorite desserts did not disappoint sauce was not too rummy and ice cream melted into the pool of buttery deliciousness bananas were perfectly cooked one friend called the food genius. another said that she could not think of a single negative thing to say. and all the ladies thought that our wonderfully attentive server troy the bartender was super studly. not that tp's already sexy atmosphere needed anymore help. even tho we were here in broad daylight, it was not hard to imagine that this place sizzles when the sun goes down, given its plush, velvety booths, walls bedecked with candles, dramatic windows, and dark woodwork. that is right - tp does not skimp on hotness, so prepare yourself for sensory overload. i'm a little hesistant to call it my new favorite restaurant in all of seattle since i've only been here once. but after sampling almost a tenth of their glorious menu and loving every last crumb of what i ate, would not that be a fair assessment"
2115,,1125,5,1/18/10,"toulouse petit gets  stars for their happy hour food selection alone, in my book they had a ton - maybe -ish.coulda been , i'm horrible at estimating - of small dishes under , which makes it really easy to order a several things to split.the best way to eat at a restaurant.again with the in-my-book comment. we had the spicy lamb sliders and the asparagus with bernaise, and both dishes were addictively awesome. normally, i am one to pay attention to the drink specials as well, but i just ordered my favorite varietal because i was with my mom, and quality not quantity was the name of the game that evening.if you know what i mean. the wine was delicious though we finished-up with an order of the flourless chocolate torte, and all i can say about that is mmmmmmmmmm.bugahhhhhh. kinda wish i did not know about it is awesomeness, being that i live within walking distance of the restaurant. other plusses ambiance  awesome. trillions again with the estimating comment of candles all over the restaurant, with sort of a modern-new orleans feel to it.although i've never been to new orleans, so who i am to say sit-down restaurant in lower queen anne that opens before pm. sometimes you do not eat lunch and need quality food in the middle of the afternoon. close to the multitudes of bus lines.and my house. try it out **okay, one minus i wish they had a website. who does not have a website i cannot forward the link to anyone to tell them i need to bring them there."
2116,Gauri H.,1111,5,11/3/18,oldest steakhouses in new york .great quality of steak. very flavorful. the steak was days old steak
2117,Jason M.,1111,5,10/19/18,"wow! incredible meal indeed.i came her for a friday lunch with my girlfriend and we were impressed from staff to finish. when you first walk in, you will notice that old school classic ny steakhouse feel that adds to the charm and history of the restaurant.we were immediately sat, it did not look particularly busy on this afternoon. we ordered the day dryaged prime ribeye steak, the heritage pig bolognese and a side of delmonico's potatoes. no drinks for us on particular day but the wine list was extensive and looked impressive. the whole drink menu was actually displayed on an ipad that the waiter hands to you which i thought was very cool.first, the day dryaged prime ribeye steak. just wow. it might be the best steak i've had so far in this city. cooked to a perfect mediumrare, the inside was succulently juicy while the outside had a nice charred crunch to it. you can really taste the dryaged flavor. some restaurants in the city will say their steak is dryaged for x amount of days meanwhile having no dryaged flavor but this steak, you can really tell by the flavor that it is real.next, the heritage pig bolognese . wow again. it is large rigatoni pasta with a bolognese sauce made with pig cheeks. the pasta was made a perfect al dente, just how i like it. i'm a pasta fiend and this one flies straight to the top of my list for pasta dishes in the city. must try.last we tried the delmonico's potatoes. it was sort of a like hot potato salad with more of a consistency of gravy. good but skippable. probably better sides on the menu.overall, amazing flavor experience at delmonico's. the steak and the pasta were to die for and prices are typical of nyc steakhouses. i will be coming back again."
2118,Marisa S.,1111,5,10/11/18,"went here on a date because my date saw it on john wick. when we got here we read up on the history of the restaurant & how it was the first fine dining establishment in america.we both extremely enjoyed the atmosphere & definitely had the best fine dining experience thanks to the helpful staff.my date ordered the signature delmonico's steak and i ordered the lamb chops. we had a started of west coast oysters then for our side orders we had mash potatoes and asparagus. i can for the first time say when i tasted the lamb chops and steak, i cried. i cried tears of joy because it was absolutely the most delicious meat to ever hit my tastebuds. however, the most surprising thing was the simple mashed potatoes and asparagus being absolutely perfected. lastly, the west coast oysters came with three different sauces to try them with and i can happily say i enjoyed every slurp.i would absolutely recommend taking anyone here to have the best full experience of fine dining."
2119,Chris L.,1111,5,10/7/18,i do not know what to say but simply one of the best dinners and steaks that i've ever had. surely in the top three. it was expertly cooked and every bite was delicious to the last. it was sad it ended but if i go back to nyc it is comforting knowing delmonico's is there.the bread they brought while i waited was good. the fries that cane with the meal were scrumptious too. i was very happy i went there and would highly recommend to anyone.
2120,Dolonchapa C.,1111,5,8/26/18,"we came here for restaurant week. they are one of the few places that keep a decent restaurant week menu.started with the salad the one with the blue cheese. i generally do not like blue cheese but they did a fantastic job of balancing out the pungency with the veggies.loved it.a good steakhouse does not go wrong with steaks. on the rare side my steak was pink and juicy when you cut into it. the broccoli was brilliant. nicely cooked but somehow had a semi crispy outside.the mashed potatoes were not fancy like you get at some places but the comfort kind. highly recommend getting a standard steak, veggies, and potatoes.the baked alaska was good. it is marshmallows so yeah it is on the sweeter side. their chocolate mousse was dope.we tried heir house chardonnay and it went incredibly well with our food. we had a great time and looking forward to revisit already."
2121,Jelena P.,1111,5,10/15/18,"amazing good , the ribeye was amazingly cooked and the side of mushrooms tasted great, dessert was heavenly!service was amazing, i sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive and friendly!"
2122,Kristy B.,1111,5,7/26/18,"i'm so glad that i started my restaurant week with ny's oldest restaurant in the history. at first, i was skeptical seeing some of the not so good reviews but honestly, everything is great. let me first start with the servers. they are extremely accommodating. exactly know what we are looking for. we had some of our vegetarian coworkers with us. there were not too many veggie options in the menu.yet they agreed to create an entree portion out of the veggie appetizer and we did not even put efforts to explain it.wine was priced reasonably for a bottle during lunch. ambience is pretty historical and fancy. loved it!! it is a huge place as well. food was eclectic. my friends enjoyed their naked ravioli while i enjoyed my lobster newberg and salmon. i was super full as i kept hogging my two course meal. although lobster newberg as an appetizer was a additional than pre fixe restaurant week meal but was happy that i tried the lobster dish.okay so for the steak my coworker got this prime delmonico steak and it was so tasteful."
2123,Melissa D.,1111,5,10/7/18,everyone brags about this place so i had to give it a shot during restaurant week with my friends! i absolutely loved it. the service was fast and the steak was just delicious. i cannot ask for better service! i will definitely be coming back.
2124,Vivian M.,1111,3,6/30/18,"skip the diamond jim crispy oysters appetizer, it was very underwhelming. the king crab mac and cheese was disappointing and overall overhyped. the fries were bland also. some parmesan or truffle oil would have saved it though.the onion rings were delicious! it was crispy and airy. we opted to get the blue cheese dressing on the side so we can dip it instead and we did not want soggy onion rings. the charred corn and creamed spinach were sound choices. i definitely recommend getting them.i tried my brother's signature steak aka the ribeye. it was delicious! i might have liked his more than mine. my boyfriend and i shared the dry aged tomahawk. it was delicious but i think the signature steak was better bang for the buck.the drinks were a little bit overpriced but my mojito was perfect. it was just strong enough for me to taste the booze, but it was also minty, sweet and acidic.overall, this is not the best steakhouse in nyc. but i had a great time and i loved how we got a private room! we did not have to scream across the table to hear one another. it was great that we were able to dine and chat in our own pace. the main dining room was really loud, it would have definitely lowered the ambience of the restaurant if we were sat there."
2125,Andrey R.,1111,3,11/6/18,"this place is old school. the steaks themselves are good. however, in general the food is very heavy and makes you to fall asleep right after you finish it. the service is good. it worth trying only once."
2126,Edward C.,1111,3,6/8/18,"to celebrate my sister's birthday, and continue a birthday tradition, it was time for some steak!for this birthday, she decided she wanted to visit the venerable delmonico's.decor is what you would expect from a restaurant touted to go back to , with a dark interior befitting candlelight, oil paintings on the wall, dark wooden furniture, and white tablecloths.our starter was dipaolo's burrata. the herb pesto and fresh burrata made for a tasty herbaceous and rich combination. the only negative being the overly buttery garlic toast which was pretty greasy.for our entrees we both had scanned the menu the day before and she ordered the signature delmonico steak, and i had my stomach set on the day dryaged prime ribeye.the restaurant's namesake steak equivalent to a boneless ribeye was delicious from what my sister proclaimed and bestowed with some pieces i also agreed.there was plenty of beef flavor despite being only wetaged, a great distribution of tasty beef fat, and a nice crisp sear on the steakhowever, i was left a bit disappointed. it was a very good steak and cooked to my desired mediumrare, but concerning taste i was expecting the touted day dryaging to impart more flavor. i found the flavor and texture of my sister's signature delmonico wetaged, prime boneless ribeye steak better. it also helped that the delmonico was cut visibly thicker than my steak. delmonico's does not list sizes of their steak on their menu, so in my best estimation, i think my ribeye was somewhere around oz oz, with my sister's delmonico weighing in around oz. oz.we both found the crispy string of onions served on top of the steak pretty lifeless in flavor, and in my opinion actually detracted from the eyeappeal of the steak.for side dishes, we were deciding beforehand what to order and decided on the roasted cauliflower and the housecut french fries.roasted cauliflower was okay, with each floret being of good size and seasoned well. i enjoyed the little pickled raisins, but could not discern the listed manchego cheese nor truffle honey.the hohum sounding housecut french fries were delicious and even more welcome was the aioli dip served on the side. fries were cut long & thick, crisp, and seasoned perfectly.the ailoi was creamy, but balanced well with a hit of either garlic and onion.no birthday meal is complete without dessert, and at delmonico's one has to try the famous baked alaska.we had pretty mild expectations for the baked alaska due to it is pretty mundane ingredients, but would up enjoying it immensely. the warm toasted and fluffy light meringue playing against the cool semisolid ice cream provided a awesome contrast in texture. especially tasty was the distinct flavor of the banana ice cream too!we added another dessert in delmonico's profiterole donut.the nearblack chocolate syrup poured on top was fabulously rich and dark chocolate tasting with just a mild sweetness.i would buy gallons of this black gold!not to be overlooked were the caramelized macadamia nuts garnished on top which were sweet and crunchy, pairing in texture to the softer components.surprisingly, the decadent ingredients did not translate to an overly heavy dessert in my opinion. the profiterole itself was very airy and the cream was very light.finally, service was just okay, but not to my standards for a renowned restaurant in this price range.some points contributing to my opinion our waiter failed to ask us about refilling our drinks despite us finishing our drinks halfway into the meal. in fact, i believe he only came by once to ask us how our dinner experience was going. we waited nearly minutes before finally having to gesture for the waiter to get the check.while delmonico's is certainly worth a visit just to say you have eaten here, in my opinion, if you are weighing delmonico's against other top nyc steakhouses, i would maybe look elsewhere."
2127,Ka Yi W.,1111,5,9/25/18,first time trying this restaurant and it was fantastic. the staff was friendly and the restaurant was beautiful. it is one of the oldest restaurants in nyc. the food was delicious and steak was cooked perfectly. everything was just perfect and amazing!
2128,Diogenes M.,1111,3,6/29/18,"came in for lunch to the grille. had the classic burger with cheddar and bacon, cooked medium rare , fries, and an ipa. the ambience was probably the best part, service was great, burger as just average. the fries were also average. for the price i expected better than average. i guess it is just a burger and will try something else next time, but overall was disappointed.also, the place was not busy, we just walked in and were seated right away. we were also offered seating in the main dining room so i do not think they differentiate as much for lunch."

2130,Dennis L.,1111,5,5/19/18,"ah!!! steakhouse in nyc yep!this is one of the historical looking buildings with amazing steak. you cannot book a reservation same day at least i could not . so they said for me to arrive around pm and ask to sit at the bar. i guess the bar has a lot of open seats.anyway i arrived on a saturday at pm. once entering, the hostess let me have a table for !! no wait!! how freaking amazing !!! so happy!!i ordered the delmonicos signature steak. medium rare. cooked to perfection! it was so delicious. did not need any sauces on it either. just some salt and pepper. woot woot! on this steak for this item.for the side, i ordered the king crab mac and cheese!!! for this. this was really good. i enjoyed eating this. !want to know the best part my wife and i do not eat large portions so the server said he would cut up the steak so we could share. so freaking amazing. the signature plate came with some onion frits also. yum yum yum! it was a lot of food for ! great deal for great steak folks!"
2131,William H.,1111,5,11/8/18,"recently had an enjoyable dining experience here at delmonico's. all the food they served was wellcooked. the staff was warm and courteous, the atmosphere relaxing and intimate. if ever you dine here, i would like to recommend the braised ribs, crispy oyster and the shrimp cocktail. this place is not disappointing. a must visit."
2132,Jane C.,1111,4,8/8/18,"to start i would give this place a . and the only reason why it is docked anything is due to the affordability.definitely not somewhere you just pop in to get a meal. my friends and i reserved a table for here for the restaurant week prix fixe dinner. our reservation was at pm on a friday night and it was not very crowded when we were seated.located in the financial district and titled the oldest restaurant in nyc , i was excited to see that iconic flat ironesque building structure, but they were doing some construction or renovations so i only saw scrim covering the entire front entrance of the building. anyway, it was still nice on the inside and such a pleasant escape from the summer heat and humidity. there was still a good enough selection on the restaurant week menu. i decided to get the naked ravioli as the appetizer, the sirloin for the entree and opted for the supplement to get the baked alaska for dessert. my husband opted for the supplement to get the lobster newberg for the appetizer. seeing as how these two items debuted at delmonico's we thought that there was no better time or place to try them.before the meal even came out, we got a basket of bread and whipped and piped! butter. the flavor of the bread was really tasty and a little sweet, not very light, almost as if it was like a soda bread.the naked ravioli comes out with pieces of ravioli in a mushroom lemon sauce with some peas, parm, and microgreens. i do not quite remember what it was filled with but it was cheesy. the skin was a little thick, but still pleasant. my husband got the lobster newberg and i got to try some and it was really delicious. the roasted sirloin was amazing, i think it is a oz serving. it was really well seasoned and only cooked to one temperature, medium. i think the cook was closer to a medium rare, but i was not complaining at all, the cook was perfect. i tried a piece of my friend's filet mignon and i personally preferred the sirloin. if i can dare to say it, i think the sirloin was even softer than the filet and on top of that sirloin in general is a more flavorful cut of meat. i do not know if they mashed the fingerling potatoes, but the potatoes were amazingly smooth and buttery beyond belief. the broccoli was not bad either. the baked alaska was a true treat to look at. to be honest, as glad as i am to have tried it, i probably would not get it from here again if i was given the chance. it was a bit underwhelming to me. it was a spiced walnut cake with banana gelato on top, covered in a meringue and toasted served with an apricot coulis. i think the texture of the cake was a little crumby and was not the most enjoyable to me. since this was my first time trying baked alaska i cannot compare it with anything or have a standard for it. the amount of meringue was a little too much for me as well. i really did like having it with the apricot coulis though as it was a nice sharp contrast to the sweet and creamy flavor profiles.the service was very good and our waiter definitely knew what he was doing and knew how to work in that caliber of a restaurant, but it was a little intimidating. i am left handed so when i moved my spoon from the right side to the left side for dessert he very pointedly slid it over from the left side to the right side before putting my dessert down. i understand there are a lot of restaurant etiquette rules so as a diner who does not frequent very fancy restaurants it was a little intimidating and i felt a little out of my element. our waiter did a very good job though.i'm glad we were able to try delmonico's for restaurant week, and i'm glad that i will be able to say i've dined here before and tried the lobster newberg and baked alaska."
2133,Jasmine S.,1111,5,8/23/18,"took our friend here to enjoy a birthday dinner in nyc. they were very accommodating our later flights and moving our reservations down. i was slightly disappointed that the front of the iconic building was getting a facelift so we could not take a picture in front. we were seated right away, and our waiter was prompt with providing us with water and bread.we all ordered the delmonico's steak please note that this steak is oz. we had no idea! it came out huge! that is what she said the steak was cooked perfectly and fatty. we also ordered their table onion rings really delicious , crab mac n cheese, and whipped mash potatoes. we were absolutely stuffed everyone but person was struggling to finish. myself including had so much trouble trying to finish it and failed.the service was great, i doubt our glasses were empty for more then minutes.the dress code of this restaurant is a bit questionable, as some people came in wearing tshirt, shorts and sneakers.if we are back in nyc we will definitely come again!"
2134,Felicia M.,1111,5,8/7/18,"i do not even know where to start, delmonico's is amazing! as soon as i found out the dates for restaurant week i zoomed over to open table to lock down a reservation since delmonico's always books up fast. i was here a couple weeks for dinner at pm it as busy but not crazy and where do i begin.the soft romantic lighting gave it this classy yet sexy feel i felt like i transported back in time to the s. the waiters dressed alike, they were kind, very formal and attentive. the high ceilings made me feel like i was in a grand hall. ok, ok, i will get to the food now.the bf and i started off with the crispy oyster jim brady bacon relish, and ho jo tartar sauce. this was off the restaurant week menu and it was well worth it the crunch on the oyster was perfect, it tasted amazing. there were or i cannot remember because they went so fast. we ordered the special feature restaurant week bottle of wine for dollars it was a cab sav and it was excellent, went perfectly with the meal. we went on to order our apps i got the seasonal summer soup, which was a cold avocado soup, it was very good, i just wish i got something it bit heartier since i really was not in the mood for a cold soup, either way, it was good. the bf got the naked ravioli which was sweet peas, wild mushrooms, preserved meyer lemon and parmesan. i did not even know what he got because it went so fast, he loved it. i had plate envy and i did not even see it lol .now to the main event.dinner. i ordered the petit filet mignon, which came with mash potatoes and seasonal veggies broccoli and the bf got prime delmonico rib eye supplement it came with the same sides i had. let me tell you, we both cut into our steaks and ate the first piece and looked at each other and said wow, i do not know if it happened exactly like that, but something to that effect. we were in awe! my filet mignon was like butter, it was smooth, rich, salted perfectly, mediumrare, and just a slice of heaven. the mash potatoes, well first off there was just not enough if i would have known how good they were i would have ordered a side! the broccoli was great too they were baked and had a bit of crunch, i really enjoyed it since i'm a big baked broccoli fan! i, of course, had to try the rib eye and, damn it was good! next time, because there will be one, i'm going to go for that since it was obvi a bigger piece of meat and just tasty as hell!the finale was the classic baked alaska supplement , which is walnut cake, apricot jam, banana gelato, and meringue! wow it was like slicing into heaven, my spoon glided right through and it took me to the promise land. it was light, fluffy, sweet, and simple, yet delicious. the perfect way to end a perfect dinner.i never gloated like this about any restaurant, it was such a great experiencefrom the attentive service to the atmosphere, everything exceeded my expectations. worth every penny, get in there as soon as possible! i will be back without a doubt!"
2135,Via G.,1111,4,11/4/18,"delmonico's is a steadfast piece of the concrete jungle with a side of strong bull. you have to come here just because it is everything nyc represents class, energy, fashion, money, youth, sophistication and medium red meat. tomahawk steak was great. made to order medium as we like it. service is pristine in this low light, wood trim classic restaurant. sides were okay. get your meat and close your eyes when you chew. take it allllll in!"
2136,Catherine N.,1111,4,9/20/18,once the best steakhouse in the world. we began with lobster bisque then we each ordered the steak of choice. two hadfiletmignonand i had the famous delmonico steak au poive. the bisque sadly was a great disappointment. we complained to each other as we were eating it but that was it. we did not return it. definitely the chef was off on that one. our steaks were delicious and the choices of sides were great. we did not have dessert this time because the offering was not appealing as in the past. i was somewhat disappointed but i will not write them off.
2137,Andrew C.,1111,4,7/31/18,"decided to kickstart restaurant week with one of the oldest steakhouses in new york. we came for dinner as we wanted to try theirfiletmignon.we arrived a few minutes early before our pm reservation but had to wait a bit because a lot of other people also made reservations. restaurant week brings everyone out! we got seated and got right to ordering!for an appetizer, i ordered the tomato salad. salad was pretty salad, nothing too special but we did not come for salad. we also had fries. they were fantastic, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crisp. for our entree, we both got thefiletmignon, medium rare. it came out in a timely fashion for a restaurant that was pretty busy. as soon as it came out, we got to cutting.steak was amazing. perfectly medium rare with pink on the inside. thefiletwas so tender and easy to cut. the meat was very flavorful and did not require extra sauce. each bite made me want more. i can see why this place has the reputation they do.for dessert, i got the chocolate mousse cake. it was good, not overly sweet and quite interesting as they seem to have some sort of water base, adding a crunchy texture to each bite of the cake.i want to add that our server and all the staff were very friendly and attentive. they always checked to make sure everything was ok for us and our glass were never empty for long.if price was holding you back from tying this wonderful establishment, consider it a steal now with a course dinner for . definitely come by and check it"
2138,Brian G.,1111,4,7/28/18,tried out delmonico's for summer restaurant week and it was a very pleasant experience. started with a delicious summer soup of pureed avocado. for main course thefiletmignonwas cooked perfectly and well seasoned. the signature baked alaska for dessert was worth the calories. service was very good and dinner was tasty. the best part of going to delmonico's is the history and ambience. it is old school but not stale. i definitely recommend this nyc institution.
2139,Vinny M.,1111,5,6/2/18,"wow. have not been here in about six years. all i remembered was the steak and ambience was so good. i came back here for a celebration with my girlfriend who has never been here before. just looking at the menu she was happy. let alone we were about to have steak. i love a good steakhouse like anyone but i prefer steakhouses with a history behind it and boy does this place have history. being the first yes first restaurant in the united states of america and also the first steakhouse in the country i already loved it. when i first came here i ordered thefiletmignonand it was delicious. we ordered the pan roasted scallops with figs and warm burrata. the pesto that came with the burrata was perfect and to die for so much so i asked my waiter david if there was a way i could purchase some unfortunately not for sale . but david did say next time the chef came out maybe he could tell us, which i thought was a nice gesture and did not expect the chef to come out just for pesto. i was wrong. executive chef william oliva came out just after our main course was brought out. he told us how to make the pesto and was very nice to meet. very solid gentleman. he chatted with us for a little bit and of course had to get back to running his kitchen. but i was amazed i got to meet him. so this time we ordered the day dry aged porterhouse which comes with the cuts offiletand sirloin. the dry aging made this steak that much more enjoyable. from cutting into the juicy tender meat i just had to barely press my knife into before the piece cut. such a satisfying feeling. i must add i order my steak medium rare and the amount of flavor was amazing. to the waitstaff and david our waiter and him having the executive chef come to our table for a pesto recipe. this experience takes the cake of any other steakhouse i've been too. i am definitely coming back here more often and highly recommend"
2140,Eric O.,1111,5,5/9/18,"while in new york we wanted to go to one classic steakhouse and after plenty of research we decided on delminicos.we absolutely loved the rich history here and it is iconic looks were something special.we had thefiletmignonand the black sea bass with a side of crab mac n cheese, all served in a timely manner and were everything we expected, and more !our waiter, albert , was outstanding and made this experience extra special.from top to bottom delminicos is a first class operation !btw , for a classy steakhouse in new york city the prices were quite reasonable, entrees , sides and drinks apiece for under ."
2141,Matt L.,1111,3,4/2/18,"restaurant week review!we chose this spot for a few reasons it was one of the places we were able to get a restaurant week reservation, it is famous iconic established in i believe , and because it was in a convenient enough location. delmonico's seems to have gone through a couple changes over the years, so i cannot say how closely it resembles that which it once was, but the theme that they go for now is oldtimey american. they specialize in american classic dishes, though they are best known for steak.since it was restaurant week, everyone's order was a flat before tax and tip. there were a couple appetizers to choose from, but some of them required price markups if you wanted to get the full version for instance, certain sizes cuts of steak had an extra associated with the cost . none of our party did this, so we mainly had to choose from three main dishes chicken a la keene, minifiletmignon, and beef short ribs. i had found out beforehand that delmonico's is allegedly where chicken a la keene was invented, so i knew before arriving what i was going to get. for my appetizer i got the lobster bisque for some reason everyone else picked the risotto , and for my dessert i ordered the cheesecake.the lobster bisque tasted a little different from what i was used to, in that it lacked it is usual savory punch that i associate with lobster bisque. if anything, it was slightly on the bitter side. my chicken a la keene was a big surprise, as i had always thought it was supposed to be a kind of, heavy white cream kind of dish. instead, there was hardly any cream sauce on my plate, and instead the chicken had been cooked with a much lighter sauce, accompanied with some vegetables. underneath i was served some pasta, which had a slightly creamer sauce mixed it, but seemed to have been prepared separately from the chicken. finally, my cheesecake was more on the creamier, liquidy side not like those concrete blocks you get at juniors and pretty enjoyable.overall, i had a good experience here, but i'm not sure i would make this a regular spot. restaurant week is supposed to be something of a discount, and i cannot picture myself paying even more money for food which was great, but a little uninspired. perhaps that comes with the territory when you are a restaurant which has been around since you stick to the classics but on my plate, it translated into something that i was not hugely excited about. still the dining space is beautiful, and i could see myself coming back here for the ambiance. the bar is especially nice, and they play sports in there, so that is another thing to check out in the future."
2142,Emily G.,1111,5,3/22/18,"i work in the area and friday's after work my colleagues and i look to dine in different restaurants we stumble upon delmonico's many times but looks very pricey so some of our colleagues wallets get intimidated, well i've decided to invite a friend and return to delmonico's and i'm happy i did it is totally worth it! the ambiance in the main room it is so welcoming and food is definitely on point, service was ok but still gets stars from me, our server looked distracted and he kinda had a weird stare made us a little uncomfortable, but overall the food was very tasty i had thefiletmignonthe perfect mr i ever had and my friend had the cut steak and the wine selection was on point. i will definitely will be returning here. definitely recommend"
2143,Kenji A.,1111,5,2/13/18,"honestly, our best meal in ny. we took advantage of the restaurant week dinner menu, and it was so worth it. we did not know much about the restaurant, the d ] c cor made me go and research as we waited for our meal. the history that surrounds the place, you can feel it i almost wish there was a little history book i could have flipped through at the table. our server and the bussers were fantastic my water glass was never empty and i drink water like a camel.filetmignonand the potatoes that accompanied it was perfect not too rich and the steak had the right searing on it. the cheesecake at the end was the right size and taste was bar none to any cheesecake i had in ny. price point was just about the same as any restaurant for a steak dinner . going during restaurant week just made it that much more of a value. we definitely intend to go back the next time we are in ny."
2144,Fetra S.,1111,5,2/7/18,"took my girlfriend here on for her th birthday. this place is amazing, from the reservation process to everything else. i had no trouble making my reservation as it was a very easy process. this was not my first choice but i'm glad i cancelled the other reservation and chose delmonico's. the ambiance of the restaurant was perfect. we had a great dinner and my lady was so happy. our waiter albert was so efficient and nice from the get go. he made us aware of the specials for the night and as well as the restaurant week menu. he also answered all of our inquiries regarding the menu which helped us make the best dinner choices. our glasses of water were refilled every minutes by the bus boys so kudos to them as well. overall, it was an amazing night and i look forward to coming back again.ps they have the biggestfiletmignonthat i've ever seen."
2145,Harvey R.,1111,5,1/28/18,great course meal for restaurant week. seafood risotto was bangin. petitefiletmignonwas tender and actually decently sized. it came on a bomb potato and cauliflower medley. cheesecake was dank af.
2146,Bobbie S.,1111,5,1/4/18,"yes there is a reason why it is highly rated and long standing! it was my first time there and i had every expectation to be greatly disappointed. not! we went for a late night dinner on a saturday.and had no problem getting a table for two. we only waited for about minutes at the most for the table. i ordered thefiletmignon. it was twice the size of any previously ordered one. it had the most perfect and amazing crust just like a steak should have! it is served ala carte and honestly you do not need sides the steak sizes are so huge! you also get a choice of toppings and sauces, but i'm a purist. the bread served while you wait was nice and crusty and warm yummy! we both ordered a drink i had the fearless french and my husband had their signature drink. very strong and delicious! we ordered a simple bottle of red wine and were so full we did not finish the sides creamed spinach and asparagus we did not even get to dessert! a perfect reason to go back which we will.and an excellent deal at considering the level of service, the atmosphere, decor and quality of food. this place definitely set the standard on what steak should taste like! and an additional bonus, fancy attire is not required you will not be forced to wear a coat and tie for entrance. loved it and will make it a point to go back here each and every time i go to nyc!"
2147,Veronica R.,1111,5,10/31/17,"extremely pleased with our dinner!!! been dying to try this place and i must say that this is my new favorite steakhouse ! my fianc ] c had the day aged ribeye and i had the gold reservefiletmignon. for appetizers we had the oysters which were an amazing quality had an almost sweet aftertaste which complimented the overall flavor , and had the creamed spinach and king crab mac and cheese as our appetizers. we asked our server for a wine that suited our taste preference and were extremely delighted when he got it right on the first try ! i was so surprised at his knowledge concerning this since most of the time we settle for whatever bottle of wine servers who have no idea what they are talking about give us haha . the gold reservefiletmignonmelted in my mouth like butter and the aged ribeye really makes a huge difference in comparison to traditional ribeyes as far as the juicy and tenderness of the meat! will definitely be coming back! worth a trip to the city but bring your wallet as this venue is a bit pricey."
2148,Mindy L.,1111,4,8/21/17,"i've heard of delmonico's but definitely have never even thought about trying it out because it is a bit expensive. so for an early birthday dinner, i decided to bring my boyfriend here. it was also the last day of restaurant week and i really wanted to try some place worth it for the prefix price. not stars because drink service was slow. i made reservations a week before for dinner at p.m. on friday, august th on opentable and had no problem at all. i had to change my reservation time around because my boyfriend was caught up at work so we ended up with a pm at last minute.we got there at and let the hostess up front know that we had a reservation but we are a bit early. she asked for my name, checked our umbrellas and reservation in, and was seated within minutes. we got one of the three person tables on the main dining area all the way in the back booth slot and it was not too crowded.as soon as we sat, a nice older waiter handed us menus and had our iced water filled. we both went with the restaurant week menu and my boyfriend ordered the delmonico no. cocktail. these cocktails were strong but my boyfriend loved it because it was exactly what he needed after a long week of work.for appetizers i got the lobster newberg for a supplement and he got the baby iceberg wedge salad. these came really quickly which surprised us because it was literally only within a couple of minutes of putting in our order with our waiter. my newberg was good and lobster was just exactly cooked. i usually like my lobster tail with a little bit of bite to it but it was a little more soft tender mushy than i would like, which made me kept thinking if it was raw or a bad lobster. also, i generally just do not eat raw food so i was not into that texture at all. my boyfriend's salad was good but he said there was a lot of blue cheese. maybe a little too much for his liking. my portion was good, there were some sliced veggies, claws and one small lobster tail that is halved and his salad was a good appetizer size.for entrees i got the petitefiletmignon only available during dinner and he got the delmonico classic steak supplement and these were perfect. i asked for medium and he got medium rare, both were cooked to perfection. i was always skeptical about restaurant week menu items because although there is a supplement, i feel like i've read a lot of reviews where they say they skimp out on the portions but this was definitely not the case. my petitefiletmignonwas indeed petite, i wish there was a bit more but i finished everything on my plate, including the roasted fingerling potatoes and broccoli. his steak was definitely worth it. it was a good size steak, definitely an inch thick and even my boyfriend who usually eats a good amount of steak, said he was full from it.for dessert, i got the classic baked alaska supplement and he got the new york cheesecake. i noted in our reservation online, that we were coming to celebrate his birthday and the not once did i mention it in person at the restaurant but the waiter lit a candle and had it in his cheesecake when it came out! he made a wish and it was extra special for him! the cheesecake was very soft and moussey, it was good but a bit warm we wish it was actually cold. my baked alaska was delicious and a lot to eat! i could not finish it but the toasted marshmallow fluff and ice cream inside was delicious. not a fan of the sour tart syrup sauce they had around the plate because it was very sour haha.overall, it was a great experience, especially with the restaurant week menu, which is why i chose to come. the only thing that makes it one less star was the drink service was slow. my boyfriend got a total of of their delmonico no. but those took sometime to get to us. it was not until halfway into our entrees did the first drink finally come. the waitress was nice and did stop by after we ate our appetizer to let us know the drink was coming, which it was not for another mins.other than that, portions were good see pictures and the experience was nice. the prefix menu plus the drinks came out to a total of about with tax and with a % tip, it was just over . i tipped % because i actually really enjoyed their service, i've head bad stories with portion and attitude problems at other places when ordering from the rw menu, and it was definitely not an issue here.this meal was a bit expensive and not something we do on a weekly basis, but definitely nice for a special event for during restaurant week."
2149,Shirley Y.,1111,5,8/20/17,went alone for lunch on friday. ordered mishima reserve gold labelfiletmignonwith asparagus and carrot sides. expensive but worth the money! enjoyed every bite!the waiter had good manner. i felt comfortable even i dined in alone. the restaurant was packed with people and it is a little crowed and noisy.
2150,JoDe R.,1111,5,8/19/17,wonderful food & service!!lobster omggggg amazing!!!filetmignonsuperb!great evening!
2151,Brian G.,1111,5,8/7/17,"it is as good as it gets when it comes to classy and a throw back to a bygone era. i had the the delmonico double cheese burger with french fries and the course restaurant week meal. we went to the bar and grill side, it was a last minute thought this past friday night, . the burger was a home run, cooked the way they chose which is rare, and it was stacked with cheddar, onion, ranhoffer sauce and love!! big and beautiful as a burger goes.they probably had the same meat purveyors since they had opened! the rest. week portion for the better half was a lobster newberg, a bit salty but still really good, followed by a petitefiletmignon, and the dessert which made them even more famous was their baked alaska. you cannot get a baked alaska as good as you can at delmonico's.that is a fact if you want to try one, this is the place to do it.it is the true classic of american steakhouses from a gilded era and still is the best, with a very attentive and knowledgable staff. % recommend it and if anyone is inviting me, i would always say a big yes!!!"
2152,Arlene L.,1111,4,8/6/17,"my son & i have been doing nyc restaurant week summer & winter for the last couple of years. we always have a great time. this year we chose delmonico's.we were early for our pm reservation, but they were willing to seat us right away. however, the hostess led us down to the basement! when i asked why we were not being seated in the main dining room, she told me there were no tables available. i insisted that we wanted to be upstairs & said we would wait. back at the front desk, she told us to have a seat, it would be a while. she was back before we even sat down & led us the first table in the dining room, just inside of the reception area. my son, who is years old, did not think it a big deal to be relegated to the basement but did note that the restaurant was basically empty. it really bothered me, being treated like we were unworthy!the food my son ordered the naked ravioli, petitefiletmignon& a glass of wine. he loved the ravioli & enjoyed thefilet. he cleaned his plate, literally, with a piece of bread dipped in butter. i chose the burrata salad & delmonico steak + . my salad was good, though i thought it was a bit skimpy & not something i could not have pulled off myself. the delmonico steak. it was a very generous size & oh my, it was soooo good! even with the boy's assistance, i took half of it home. dessert my son got the cheesecake, rather small & just ok. the baked alaska + was lovely although they did not flamb ] c it & delicious.also, the waiter took a beautiful photo of the two of us. other than the poor welcome, we had a lovely evening."
2153,Juliana T.,1111,4,8/6/17,"we came here for summer restaurant week , and it definitely did not disappoint. first off, the ambiance of this place is old world classic. the hostesses look very out of place in their bellybaring tops and miniskirts, but the waitstaff look clean and professional in white dress shirts and black vests.we were seated in the lower level, which was less opulent than the first floor dining room, but still beautiful and in keeping with the overall decor and theme of the restaurant.service was really great except one waiter who was a little curt, but nothing glaring. our main waiter was very friendly and professional.the rw menu is a bit limited, but there are options to upgrade to better dishes at a supplement charge. for starters, we had the naked ravioli stars tiny pieces of ravioli with an average ricotta filling but yummy mushroom sauce and lobster newberg supplement, starssuper tender young lobster tail and claws in a todiefor creamy sauce, but there was no caviar as listed on the menu . entrees were the petitfiletmignon starstender, wellseasoned, and also came with a delicious steak sauce and the classic steak supplement, starsalso very tender and wellseasoned . and finally, our desserts were the baked alaska supplement, starsthe toasted merengue was nice, but the banana ice cream was too frozen and crystallized and the chocolate mousse cake starsfluffy and very chocolatey . we also had a bottle of their special rw red wine , which was great with all the red meat.overall, great experience, great food!"
2154,Dave K.,1111,5,6/25/18,"i have been to delmonico's a few times and most recently in early june. i have had an amazing experience, each time. i think it is the beststeakhouse in the usa, and clearly the best in nyc, forget that place in williamsburg that cuts yoursteakfor you .i usually start with a dirty martini, and cesar salad. i always get thedelmonicosteak.beststeakin nyc, juicy, flavorful, and you can cut it with a butter knife. my most recent visit, my wife ordered the donuts for desert.it was amazing. anyone visiting nyc, should really visit delmonico's."
2155,Ji T.,1111,5,1/28/18,"if you are in town and want to try out thedelmonicosteakor many other dishes that were famously originally created from the oldest restaurant in america, you must rsvp via opentable at least a day ahead. there is also a bar section and its own entrance. thedelmonicosteakitself does not come with any sides, i highly recommend my creamed spinach because you want to morally feel healthy when you are chowing down on a thick slab of cow."
2156,Rie Z.,1111,5,1/20/18,"hard to have anything but praise when food comes out perfect. there is only one reason this restaurant is still great. they care, about the customers experience and their food. we had one lobster, one filet and onedelmonicosteak. everyone one was happy i will say do not skip billy bacon it is amazing. we also ordered bacon fried rice anddelmonicopotatoes. i found the brussels sprout with some peppers were wonderful. i usually do not talk about dessert but i was excited to try the real baked alaska. i can only say wow not what i actually thought it was but it was wonderful. it was was walnuts cake with ice cream and tons of yummy torched meringue. the profiteroles were also amazing ! the only thing we felt was meh was the apple tart. the staff was also excellent not the stubbed greeting last big islandsteakhouses are know for either. this staff was anxious to make your appointment and experience flawless."
2157,Marissa V.,1111,5,12/8/17,"we came to this restaurant to celebrate my parents' th anniversary. my brother arrived early to surprise my parents, and the hostesses and wait staff completely played along they allowed him to play a waiter, serving my parents water until they recognized him! i cannot thank this restaurant enough for going the extra mile to make my parents' th anniversary dinner and surprise visit by my brother a success. so i give delmonico's service five stars out of five!as for the food, it was fantastic! my brother and i believe it was the beststeakswe ever had we had thedelmonicosteaks. the wine selection is extensive, and the wait staff is quite knowledgeable and obliging in providing selections. so pleased with our visit . i will be back the next time i'm in nyc!"
2158,Eric R.,1111,5,12/2/17,"from the outside it does not look like much and with lots of hype being one of the oldeststeakhouses in america. so i came into this place with big eyes and an empty stomach.do not forget to come in with a full wallet too as the food is a bit pricey but i think its worth the price for a special occasion. the crab cake i had was amazing, with big juicy pieces of crab and being held together just barely enough so all the other ingredients do not over power the crab. the ny strip anddelmonicosteakswere cooked perfectly and had a rich deep flavor of wonderfully dry aged beef.take your time and enjoy every single bite, i know i did! stars."
2159,Daisy M.,1111,4,11/26/17,"not sure where to start with this place. i have only been times in my lifetime & i have to say i have never been disappointed with the food and service. the place is pretty hoity toity upscale with that being said i did not find it very memorable or enjoyable more of a monotone vibe . i usually have the the signaturedelmonicosteakwhich is always amazing and should be for the price , but if you prefer a leanersteakwith less fat, then this is definitely not thesteakfor you.i recommend this place for a special dinner celebration as the food is excellent, but i do not feel it is a place to frequent for a couple of reasons st i do not think the menu ever changes, nd prices are not reasonable the tab has always been over for peoplehence why i've only gone once a year over the past years and lastly. not very memorable, the environment felt a little up tight. the staff were very attentive, without much personality i guess this is the tone all around .bottom line, delmonico's is truly an iconic & historic fixture of nyc so as a new yorker you must try it at least once. based on the food quality, i rate this place . stars. if i had to rate the environment & ambiance, i would give it stars guess i'm not at that success point in life yet where everything has to be so serious & uptight . it is a true classic upscale experience, but if you are looking for the latest & greatest go elsewhere."
2160,Bill G.,1111,5,8/12/17,one of my all time favorites!! i always enjoy the pan roasted halibut and thedelmonicosteak.they never disappoint.
2161,Mehrnaz H.,1111,3,8/5/17,"had a reservation for pm, was seated around pm. when is asked about the reason for wait, the response was they seat about customers at the restaurant and cannot guarantee the prompt seating!! that was not what i expected of a restaurant of this caliber and long years of experience.when seated, it seemed there was a confusion on who was going to be serving us, took a while for them to serve us bread and butter to start with. we opted for the restaurant week pre fix menu. ordered the poke tuna and lobster for appetizers. both were delicious both had a surcharge on top of the pre fix . for entree we had the filet mignon anddelmonicosteak. i really preferred the taste and tenderness of the filet mignon much more than thesteak. the side of broccoli was a bit overdone for my taste.ordered the baked alaska and the chocolate mousse for dessert, really enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake. it was silky and rich. waited for another min for someone to present us the bill.i really expected better service from a place likedelmonico."
2162,Tonia N.,1111,5,6/8/17,great meal and terrific service. the signaturedelmonicosteakwas exceptional. the bison special was good but a little pricy. no regrets.
2163,Michelle W.,1111,3,5/11/17,"more like a . but rounded down to because of the amateur mistakes delmonico's is making.we came with a reservation late friday evening. while we were waiting for the party to arrive, we grabbed drinks at the bar, which was fun and bustling.once the rest of our party arrived, we were seated immediately. the restaurant has a very dimly lit ambience definitely very intimate and high class.everything on the menu looked great. choosing between the lobster newberg and the filet, i ended up settling for the filet, since we were at a steakhouse of course. my friends also for the filet anddelmonicosteak. we got the bearnaise sauce to share. we split three sides roasted vegetables,delmonicopotatoes, and fries. our waiter was very open and transparent with us about the portion of the sauce and sides.filet mignon this was the beststeaki've had in my life. it was extremely tender and flavorful do not let anyone tell you filet mignons are not! . one qualm i did have with it, though, was that i ordered it mediumrare and got a something definitely very rare. i read other reviews of theirsteaksbeing undercooked, so maybe overestimate how you would like yoursteakcooked the filet also came with some leafy greens, which was nice with the heavy meal we were having.delmonicosteak thissteakwas pretty disappointing. i tried a bit from of my friends, but much preferred the filet mignon. it was very fatty and sinewytotally the opposite of my butter filet. my friend actually ended up cutting away of hissteakbecause it was too gristley and fatty for him. i guess if you like that stuff you should get thedelmonicosteak, but if you like a very clean and tendersteak, get the filet.bearnaise sauce very buttery, rich, and delicious. the consistency was weird, though, in that it was not pourable and more like a spread think mayonnaise. . so i had to spread it onto mysteak.sides we got for people, but probably could have gotten one more.delmonicopotatoes were very tasty and i've had nothing like it before mini potatoes baked in a cheesy cream sauce . the roasted carrots also were very pretty as they were purple, red, and orange dessert although we were full, we had to try baked alaska, as it originated here. it was amazing. the outside meringue was super creamy, but also light. the ice cream and cake provided a nice contrast too. definitely would get one of these if you are here.service was bizarre. in the middle of our meal, our waiter announced that his shift was over and the sommelier would be taking our table over. not a huge problem, but just bizarre. also one of the table runners tried our baked alaska clearly before we were done. felt like we were being rushed.overall the experience felt very classy, fancy, and historic, so i was pleased with the experience, just disappointed in the amateur mistakes like undercooking thesteakand odd service. probably would not come back because there are better steakhouses at better prices, but delmonico's should be on the nyc bucket list for anyone who is excited about fine dining and historic food."
2164,Julia M.,1111,5,4/19/17,"this is history. culinary history. the lobster newburg is better than i have had anywhere in boston. it is a pound lobster with just enough newburg sauce. it is not swimming in sauce, because lobster is delightful on its own, why hide the flavor it also comes with potatoes and spinach. a very filling meal. the greatest takeaway is that the lobster was cooked perfectly. even in boston, i find it overcooked way too often, and it is tough.steak! i feel fortunate enough to have dined with people who share their food. our table got the signaturedelmonicosteak, and the day dry ageddelmonicosteak. so we all got to realize perfection in tasting dry aged vs wet aged. they were both excellent. the wet aged is juicier, but my choice will always be the dry aged. i felt it had more meatiness and they do a perfect char around the entiresteakthat i have never seen. not burnt, but a flavorful char. once you get towards the bone, it is like beef bacon!!but, if you are on a date or a business meal, get the regulardelmonicosteak. it will be great, boneless, and you will not have the urge to get all fred flintstone and pick up the bone and gnaw on it for all the deliciousness that it has to offer.oh, and how can i forget for appetizers, we got the cheek and bone and then we passed around the rather perfect eggs benedict. i keep using the word perfect here, but that is what these dishes were. the eggs benedict were perfect with orange roe on top. the sauce, the egg yolks, the smoked meat, it was everything i needed it to be! the cheek and bone was in itself a moment to remember. i cannot begin to tell you how much flavor was in the bone marrow and crispy bits. and how tender and tasty the cheek meat was. i always contend that facial meat is the most underutilized meat on any animal. so good!the baked alaska is devine. i understand the gelato in the baked alaska is made on the premises. we also had the blueberry pie ] la mode. more of a tart with a struesel topping, but well accomplished. the winner on the dessert menu by far, hands down is the cr ] are me brul ] c e. i am normally quite tired of cr ] are me brul ] c e on every menu, however, this is not like any cr ] are me brul ] c e i have ever had or made. it is closer to a panna cotta with the carmelized sugar on top. so creamy, so smooth, and it is served out of the dish. again, reminds me of panna cotta, but much better with a couple other components to the dessert.this place is old school. if you are looking for the latest greatest food technology that will wow you, go somewhere else. if you want classic dishes done perfectly that will wow you, then come here."
2165,Mo K.,1111,5,4/12/17,"excellent customer service! a couple of friends and i went in on a friday night and it was a bit packed but were able to get a table without a reservation. it was in the middle of everything which at first made me a bit uncomfortable.we started off with getting west coast oysters and tuna tartar. the oysters i'm a bit neutral with as they are not something i eat often, but they were good. i have no complaints about it. the tartar was absolutely amazing. we also ordered thedelmonicosteakand the day draged bone in rib eye all this food was split amongst three people cooked the way the chef prefers it. overall the food was delicious and it is something we all enjoyed.what absolutely made this is an excellent experience was the staff and great care they took with us. they were very aware of what was needed and what needed to be brought out at the right time. they were not overbearing but happened to serve us at the right times. it was fairly packed but that caused no issues or delays in service. we got a brief history lesson and some minutiae details about delmonico's.we ended our night with the baked alaska. they used a lighter torch to bake the meringue in front of us which looked very nice but left an odd taste on the browned meringue. overall an amazing experience."
2166,Peter G.,1111,5,3/6/17,"you are in for a treat as soon as you walk into this wood dominated historical carnivorium. this restaurant invented so many culinary staples and was the first at so many aspects such as the use of tablecloths and offering reservations you owe it to yourself as a new yorker to enjoy it at least once. appetizers, spearheaded by billy's housecured bacon, the most delicious bacon i've ever had, was thrilling. indeed the king crab mac and cheese was packed with flavor. thedelmonicosteak, namesake potatoes, and roasted cauliflower were a winning trifecta. a shade disappointed with the baked alaska. neighboring bar is happy and loud. bartenders have a good hand and imagination. waiters were attentive, knowledgeable, and informative. a first class dining experience."
2167,June S.,1111,4,2/9/17,"this is a review of restaurant week dinner.when you think of real, classic restaurant of all time in the us, delmonico's should come to your thoughts. it is the first fine dining restaurant in the country, opened in . this is where thedelmonicosteak, eggs benedict, balked alaska, chicken a la keene, and lobster newburg were created. yes, they are the original of all originals!the main dining room was much larger than i expected, with antique style chandeliers, classic wall papers that extended from the front foyer, and large paining on the back wall. the painting depicted welldressed patrons at a fancy restaurant,i assume it was a painting of delcmonico's it is the perfect painting to be in this room, it sort of creates a window into how this dining room used to look like, once upon a time. this room had nice lively energy, a bit noisy but matching the hustle of bustle of the city.through the bar next to the main dining room was another dining room, smaller, more private and quiet. this is a much better setting for business dinner, date, or anyone who wants to have a little less noise. this dining room was a bit more dimmed with softer lights and candles at each table.out of the restaurant week menu, we had buffalo mozzarella & yellow beefsteak tomato, lobster bisque, short ribs, petit filet mignon, baked alaska extra supplement , and dark chocolate mousse cake. thesteakwas really great, melt in my mouth great. everything else were really tasty as well, no complaints at all.our waitress, marina was very nice, courteous and polite. she was very friendly only if the customers wanted her to be, and quiet when the customers wanted to dine in silence. either way she always kept a smile on her face, and very efficient and professional with her work. we were well taken care of by marina and by other staffs. our water was always filled, dirty dishes taken away quickly, and dishes brought out at perfect timing. we really enjoyed our dinner here at delmonico's!"
2168,Toddy P.,1111,3,2/6/17,"it is quite disappointing because i first came here for restaurant week a few years ago, and i've been a huge fan since. the buffalo mozzarella and yellow beefsteak tomato was delicious. but how wrong can you go there thesteak.sigh. the previous times i've come here, the signaturedelmonicosteakwas like buttah! thesteakscould easily have been cut with a butter knife. mysteakwas filled with gristle, chewy, and difficult to cut. and it was midrare.well it was supposed to be. it was closer to medium. i ordered the signature baked alaska for the first time. i find it cloyingly sweet like queens white cake frosting instead of br ]al ] c ed merengue.the service, as usual, is impeccable. truly wonderful service. i wished this trip was as great as the others."
2169,Ali M.,1111,1,1/28/18,"too bad i missed the review about the roaches before i went or i would not have the opportunity to write this review today.i am not certain how this place has so many awesome reviews based upon my most recent experience. it is very well possible that i personally expect a higher degree towards excellence if i am dining at an establishment well known over the years for top quality food service delivery. i was disappointed with my first and last visit to this restaurant. my main gripe with this place is the temperature of the food. if i orderbraisedshortribsi expect the dish to come with a temperature rivaling hot or at least close to just coming out of the oven . unfortunately, it was not and neither were the rest of the dishes presented to our table of four. after a thoroughly disappointing meal for all of us we decided to order the absolute worst dessert in the history of desserts not to die for.the baked alaska. wow! was it gross. the banana flavored cake with gritty hard frozen vanilla ice cream and the scorched fluff exterior made for a dessert not worth tasting. power to all of the people that dine here for the status because that must be the only reason to frequent a dungeon like this. shame on you delmonico for ripping people off over years. everyone should do themselves a favor and if you go to the restaurant and do not like the food make sure to let the server know. it is apparent that no one in the kitchen either cares or is aware of the atrocities leaving the cooktop. thumbs down all around!meals all of them are over priced but these are the main dishes we haddelmonico signature steaknot warm but tender. had better elsewheredelmonico potatoesworth a try, but who comes to a steakhouse only for potatoes lamb chopsthis is better at texas de brazil at any location you can find and it is endless when you go there. can someone from delmonico's go taste this item at a restaurant that knows how this should be done braisedshortribi had better during a demonstrative speech in college when someone brought to class in a bucket. not a good dish at delmonico's by any means. i have been to a number of fine dining establishments and this one is my top worst on the list so far "
2170,Amelia R.,1111,4,2/27/17,"just a commoner who ate here during restaurant week _ got beet risotto for appetizer. it was delishhh! you can taste so many flavors dancing in your mouth! then i hadbraisedshortribs, which was huge esp. after appetizer , but mashed potato was on point lastly i had chocolate mousse, which was a perfect closure since they got the portion and the richness of the chocolate just right.overall, i looove the food, the interior, the ambience and the service. giving stars bcos my friend's lobster bisque was almost like soupy rather than creamy , only had few lobsters and taste a bit bland, it was just okay."
2171,Matthias H.,1111,5,2/12/17,"i went for restaurant week and was very impressedi cannot believe i have not gone before in over five years of working nearby. i would have thought that a place with this much history would coast along on its reputation, but the food is truly excellent. the salads were fresh and delicious, and thebraisedshortribswere tender, juicy and very delicious. desserts were good but not amazing but i will say that the berries were some of the most flavorful i've tasted during the winter . the staff were all helpful and the dining room is beautifultake some time to admire the paintings. i will be sure to return!"
2172,Andera B.,1111,2,2/8/17,"went to delmonico's for restaurant week last night with my husband. the environment, atmosphere, & service were all great. being the oldest restaurant in america, the location is well maintained and retains an air of old school charm. the staff are all incredibly efficient and friendly.but the food was not great.appetizers roasted beet risotto & lobster bisque. both dishes were lukewarm. the bisque was more watery that creamy and there was a flavor we could not place.until my husband bit into half of a spear of clove. the risotto was good, but i wish it had arrived at the table at a hotter temperature.entrees petit filet mignon & hourbraisedshortribs. the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and had a good flavor. theshortribsalso had good flavor but the accompanying grits were too grainy for my liking.dessert cheesecake & chocolate mousse. the cheesecake had a lime flavored sauce which i did not care for. the chocolate mousse had a base of something crunchy which after some examination looked suspiciously like cocoa krispies cereal.overall, it was a great experience but delmonico's would not be my first choice steakhouse to return to."
2173,Diana L.,1111,3,2/7/16,i was there for restaurant week. the food was good. i was really expecting the food to be better but it was good not great. we had a rock shrimp russia and lentil soup for appetizers. they were okay. for dinner we had the delmonicos steak andbraisedshortribs. the steak was very good and thebraisedshortribswere so soft. very good. i was just disappointed with the appetizers but the main course was great!
2174,Tiffany H.,1111,4,2/15/11,"came here for restaurant week with my roommate. we have a friend who works there so we visited him during the lunch hour and had the most fantastic time.my roommate had. the delmonico salad candied walnuts, beets, argula, other stuff. it was on okay salad. she seemed to enjoy it. mushroom risotto she said it was the best she ever had. i had a taste and it was so rich and creamy and delicious it was a really good risotto. baked alaska supp. delmonico claims to have invented this dessert so it was fitting that one of us get. having only had cruise ship baked alaska experiences before today, this was a great surprise. the meringue on the outside was so thick and luscious. the banana ice cream with the cake biscuit at the bottom with creme anglais and apriot sauce. it was honestly such a unique and tasty dessert.i had. seafood chowder it was a tomato based soup with little bits of seafood in it. it was pretty good and had a good base but i would not have considered it a chowder. delmonico steak supp. all the posts had said that this steak was really good and basically a must have at this restaurant even better that the fillet mignon in a lot of reviews . it was good but not great in my opinion but i am not a big meat eater and the sheer size of the steak as it came out of the kitchen oz. i almost died. i would have been much happier with thebraisedshortribsthat was less meat and did not need a large supp. but that was my mistake and i should have known that i would not have properly enjoyed a steak. i felt like i was getting a jaw workout chewing it. left about oz of it on my plate when they took it away. steaks are a man's food and i just cannot keep up. chocolate hazelnut cake the cake had good dark chocolate flavors and the passion fruit sauce around the plate as a good compliment but by far my favorite thing about this dessert and i do not like desserts normally was the texture it had. the slight crunch from the hazelnuts made this cake for me.though there were little things about the menu that i was not completely happy with, everything had great flavor and it was all delicious. plus, we got to meet everyone there through our friend and chatting with the entire staff, including chef william, of this historic restaurant made our experience irreplaceable."
2175,Edward D.,1111,5,8/28/18,"great place to eat downtown ny. this restaurant has been around in one incarnation or another since . steak delmonico & lobster newberg were invented here & while disputed, so wereeggsbenedictand baked alaska. the restaurant is beautiful and the service is excellent. it is not an everyday meal, but well worth it for a special lunch or dinner."
2176,Chris A.,1111,4,1/29/17,"every year around the holidays, a good friend of mine and business associate have made it a habit of celebrating the end of another year.in the black.capitalism rules, etc etc.it is always about good steak and good drinks. this time it was time to try the original delmonico's at the southern tip on manhattan. i say original because they also have a newer delmonico's kitchen midtown near msg. so we grabbed our red cups of scotch and jumped in an uber.first off, i will never give a steak house stars. my reasoning is that although you may have an amazing meal.it is still a beef focused menu. the kitchen's creativity is going to be clipped about how far they can go as opposed to cafe matisse in rutherford nj or a viaggio in wayne nj .i mean how many freakin times do i have to see creamed spinach, garlic mash, frizzled onions on menu ! .honestly, if you practice a bit with your grill or oven, and use a good piece of aged meat from a good butcher or market, i'm sure you too can make a slab of heaven on a plate.that being said, i give del's stars for it is excellent food, excellent service and atmosphere, and it is contribution to the restaurant world. and i love the history of this place! delmonico's is the first food establishment to actually be called a restaurant .first to use table clothes.almost every you.s. president since abe lincoln ! has eaten here.it is chefs have created the infamous delmonico steak a certain aged cut of ribeye you see all over. they have createdeggsbenedict, lobster newburg, chicken a la keene and the dessert baked alaska more on that later of course it has a great selection of spirits and over , bottles of good wine.the food started off with the cheek & bone which is snake river farm beef cheek, crispy bone marrow, butternut squash. absolutely delicious. bone marrow is an old european peasant dish as i like to call it. huge flavor albeit a high fat content. this was good, although not a lot of marrow in the bone. the beef cheek was great.dayboat sea scallops with cauliflower, beets, frog hollow farm pears was prepared as good as scallops can get. the pears add a nice light sweetness that i've never really had with this bivalve.entrees were the delmonico steak when in rome. topped with foie gras oof and bully for me and a day dry aged tbone steak oscar oscar style being topped with a tarragon hollandaise sauce and asparagus. yeah, we skipped lunch that day.lol the steaks were excellent as is expected in an institution like this and about others in nyc so what more can i say other than it is what it is .only waste of time was the crispy alebattered onion rings with buttermilk blue cheese dressing.which reminded a lot like store bought y'know perfectly round & breadcrumby . the dressing was flat and had little flavor. and at for approx onion rings.forget it !!of course we had to push it and get dessert. i've always heard of baked alaska, but never tried it because i am not too fond of meringue. a dessert created in in celebration of the purchase of alaska from russia is not being a foodie educational! their version of this dish is made of banana ice cream placed in a pie dish lined with slices of sponge cake,with a thin layer of apricot compote and topped with meringue. the entire dessert is then placed in an extremely hot oven for a brief time, long enough to firm and caramelize the meringue. the meringue is an effective thermal insulator, and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream and melting it. it is a blend of warm and cold with such various, delicious flavors. one of my most favorite desserts of all time. but be warned, most restaurants that make this dish change it around a bit.all in all a great meal. delmonico's delivers what is expected. treat yourself on a special occasion. places like this are institutions, not just restaurants."
2177,George C.,1111,3,8/12/16," rw is not a good deal if you are getting supplements aka any of their signatures, but fortunately they charged us the lunch price of so it evened out. allegedly the first restaurant to dining establishment to have a printed menu, baked alaska,eggsbenedict, & lobster newburg.we experienced all but thebenedict, and the alaska was definitely our favorite. dishes emerged unnervingly quickly, and the bus boys were clueless throughout, and servers kept rubbing against me through the meal, but overall we are happy we made it in.gazpachorefreshingnewburg carbonaratastynewburgvery good but will not brave it againfilet mignon wellpreparedbaked alaska great and well worth the supplementchocolate moussegreat and slightly untraditional, with a crunch and flavor zip"
2178,Elton W.,1111,4,5/23/16,"delmonico's is one of the few places in the financial district that is close to stars, primarily because of it is rich history.i mean, any restaurant that is been around since and was a favorite of abraham lincoln, theodore roosevelt, jp morgan, charles dickens, napoleon iii and mark twain, has to be on that list.i give delmonico's only stars as the food is not up to star quality, in my opinion. i would not come here just based on the food, as i think it is good, but not necessarily great. but the history definitely is great. here's my breakdown history . starsambiance . starsfood . starswine . starsprice . starsso, the question you are probably asking, is, why would elton be recommending this place so highly if the food is just ok well, here are a few facts about delmonico's that makes it more unique than any other restaurant in the united states, and a reason why i think it deserves at least one visit.delmonico's is the first & oldest fine dining restaurant in the you.s., since first to use the french word restaurant to describe itself first restaurant to use a printed menu first restaurant to use tablecloths & silverware restaurant with the largest wine cellar in the you.s. at that timein addition, delmonico's created invented these dishes, which are still popular almost years later eggsbenedict manhattan clam chowder delmonico's steak delmonico potatoes lobster newburg chicken a la king baked alaskaif you have not had any of these dishes, i highly recommend you try them as they are all good, in my opinion. and if you get a chance to try them at delmonico's, even better. although, to be honest, other places have perfected these dishes, so i'm not saying delmonico's is the best version, but it is the original.lastly, if you are a foodie and looking to be blown away by amazing cuisine, then this is not the place for that and i can assure you that you will be disappointed. yes, there are better steaks in the city, yes, there are bettereggsbenedict, chowder, etc. at other places, and yes, the ambiance is really old school and frankly, old. but, there is no denying that delmonico's is what started the restaurant industry here in the united stats, and for that, i think it is worth a visit."
2179,Zack F.,1111,4,4/27/16,"a place that is so rich in history with decades of experiment behind them can only be an expertise when it comes to a steak. like the name implies, the delminco steak was invented by the restaurant along with baked alaska,eggsbenedict, and several other things. not enough history for you how about being the first fine dining estaishment in the country not enough maybe the inventor of a la carte in america. thanks to this restaurant it is your choice what to get on your dish wheeler you go. the decor was quite lovely a little old and could maybe use a little touch up but then again this place has been around for decades so maybe keeping that old charm would be best for again place as important as this. it is a legend amongst steakhouses. the outside decor is just stunning. beautiful and luxurious with the two front pillars sitting outside the building directly imported from the buried city of pompeii itself. dress professional for this spot. the filet mignon ordered was just juicy and tender quite stunning. one of the best filet mignon i have ever tasted. and the delmonico steak they are the creators so what do you think stunning. amazing such flavor and tenderness with every bite. truly the best delmonico steak you will ever have ! amazing. the mashed potatoes were also creamy and rich one of the best. over all this place is a legend amongst fine dining and steakhouses and is a definite check out. stick with what a steakhouse does best, steak, and you will be handsomely rewarded. truly an amazing steakhouse. your mouth will melt with every bite.the interior decor is quite aged but then again does it need to be modernized a place with such hisyory, probably not.friendly staff by the way, our waiter was always attentive to us and made us feel comfortable."
2180,Maria D.,1111,3,3/31/16,"is this the best probably not. i would really look to brooklyn st. anselm and peter luger or queens m. wells for a better steakhouse. is this an experience absolutely. the place is steeped in history, being the first fine dining establishment in the states, and has invented many dishes, includingeggsbenedict, lobster newberg, and the baked alaska.came here for the boyfriend's birthday. just dinner for two. i ordered a martini and was sad to discover that there was no plymouth gin. bummer, but not the end of the world. the bf had a glass of a lovely bordeaux.for appetizers, we ordered the scallops and lobster newberg. both were phenomenal and i would highly recommend these dishes. the scallops were fresh and sweet, and the lobster was rich and buttery.the bf got a delmonico streak, while i ordered the chicken. i would normally make fun of someone like myself ordering poultry in a place known for steak. but, alas, i almost never eat red meat anymore. the chicken dish was described as containing chanterelles. when it arrived, the bird was topped with cremini aka button mushroom aka the common mushroom. the cheapest most boring mushroom. the cremini did not work with the roasted onionsapple soubise sauce that the chicken was resting on. the flavor of the apple would have worked with chanterelles, but cremini awful. thankfully, i was full from the appetizers and was saving room for the baked alaska.the bf loved his steak. we also ordered the mashed potatoes and a special side of broccoli rabe. both were nice. i tried a little tiny bite of the steak and enjoyed it.the baked alaska was great. they brought it out with a solitary candle and thankfully did not sing birthday songs. the meringue is incredible and i would gladly eat it every day of my life. the banana sorbet was an unexpected but nice touch.service was attentive and apt, apart from failing to notify me that there will be no chanterelles in my chicken dish.overall, i'm not going to seek out another visit, but if somebody brings me there for a celebration or a work dinner, i would be okay with that."
2181,Cindy M.,1111,5,6/13/14,"we frequent steak houses in and around the city, and many are very good to excellent. our current favorite is delmonico's in the financial district at beaver street. delmonico's is an old fashioned ny steakhouse with the atmosphere you would expect and the history that makes it a true ny landmark.they claim that demonico's was the first fine dining establishment in nyc and was diamond jim brady's favorite restaurant, they also claim to have invented delmonico steak,eggsbenedict, lobster newburg, and baked alaska. i can tell you, that whether they were invented here or not, their lobster newberg and baked alaska are probably the best i've ever had. their steaks are done to perfection and among the best in nyc. the delmonico steak and filet mignon are our favorites. the delmonico potatoes are not to be missed either. the service at delminico's is perfect, the waiters seem to appear table side exactly when you need them. the price point is on par with other good ny steakhouses. reservation are a must during dinner hours and weekdays are crowded with wall street workers."
2182,Jason F.,1111,4,5/23/13,"went here for a birthday last month and i really liked this place. they are the restaurant that created a ton of iconic dishes, some of which are not on the menu for example theeggsbenedictwas on the menu in the bar pub area but not in the main dining room, but they say they welcome offmenu orders like that. i also liked that they did not rush us ever and were very polite. if you are a history buff, you need to get down to delmonico's."
2183,Rhonda W.,1111,4,1/6/13,"so, i do not want to place this review under delmonico's bar and grill the side entrance because i do not want this review to get missed but. did you know the side entrance existed and, apparently delmonico's is whereeggsbenedictwas invented! yeah, that is right and i ordered it, loved it, ate every last bite, and will probably come back for more as a cheat meal breakfast . they are not messing around with theeggsbenedict thick slabs of ham, creamy tangy hollandaise sauce and a nice thick round toasted bit to soak up the yumminess.the coffee here was also great, served fresh at the table and plenty of refills if you find your cup empty.i'm proud to have made this review my th one, and i hope you come to endulge in the history ofeggshere everyday between noon and pm !"
2184,Jennifer L.,1111,5,7/25/12,"i am a big fan of delmonico's! we order take out frequently when working late and love their rib eye steak, but today we were able take a nice break and dined for their restaurant week lunch. the menu was great. we all had the watermellon gazpacho, which had ceviche tasting shrimp in it! the sirloin steak was amazing!!! sliced and perfectly medium rare with a wine reduction sauce over this delicious cream of potatoes. i want more of it! now! the dessert was great too. i had the lemon cheesecake, which was smooth and light tasted like key lime pie! we also tried their baked alaska, which is one of their many signature dishes which they are famous for creating. home of the firsteggsbenedict ! oh and apparently the term  would was first created by their chef in , where the delmonico's steak was item number on the menu and he would tell the staff they were out of the steak for the day! take a break and dine here, amongst all it is history! dine like the best of them! from abraham lincoln to jp morgan to mark twain to teddy roosevelt to napoleon!"
2185,Ann L.,1111,4,12/29/10,"for some reason, restaurant week turned into restaurant month this year. no complaints here, though.came here for a friend's birthday due to the extension of rw. the minute i stepped inside, i could tell this was a high class place. apparently it also has its share of history too, as it was the birthplace of baked alaska paging sarah palin andeggsbenedict. what the what how awesome is that my tastings from the rw menu grilled asparagus and frizee salad with tangerine and grapefruit and poachedegg fresh and light, summery. i'm not usually a big fan of frizee since it is usually too bitter, but the bitterness was balanced well by the sweetness of the tangerine and surprisingly, the grapefruit i'm also not a grapefruit fan by any means .filet mignon tender, moist, and lying on a delicious bed of creamy potatoes. the vegetable accompaniment was a nice gesture to stave off the guilt of eating my month's worth of animal fat content in one sitting.chocolate peanut butter mousse every dieter's worst nightmare an irresistable combination of chocolate and peanut butter, and no rationalization for why you should be eating this in the first place except for the fact that it tastes damn good.service was excellent, even though it was clear that we were here for rw, which was considerably cheaper than what the meal would have been if we had ordered from the regular menu. three cheers for rw, the only way i can afford to eat like a wall street honcho without having to learn all that banking stuff."
2186,Angela K.,1111,3,10/13/10,"a classic. real old school new york! this place has been around since . that is unheard of! the restaurant is located in the financial district in a beautiful building. although bustling by day, come night time it is pretty desolate down there. the interior is large and elegant. and has that dark wood, fine dining feel, without being completely stiff.start off with some classic cocktails. this is the type of place you order a tom collins or a manhattan. delmonico's is a classic american steak house and the originator of many popular dishes of today.eggsbenedict, baked alaska and the delmonico steak, among others. for our visit we went with the filet mignon and the delmonico cut steak both cooked perfectly. pair it with some typical steak sides like creamed spinach, hash browns and whipped potatoes and you will be so full you will not be able to stand. make sure that you leave a little room for the meringue covered baked alaska. it was worth the wait.the scene elegant, old school new york steakhousefood and drinks . pleasantly stellar! i love myself a juicy steak and some potatoes.tip worthy gratuity included. service started off a little snippy, but the waiter warmed up and became extremely helpful and friendly.coordinates city minute ride to fun. when you walk on to the street after dinner, you will be the only one there. hop a cab uptown for some action.restaurant return rate yellow light. great experience but not sure we would venture all the way downtown to eat here again.this review written by angela."
2187,Matt E.,1111,4,7/19/10,"delmonico's is truly a nyc treasure and not just for it is historic value but for it is food. to date delmonio's is the nd oldest restaurant in new york st being the river cafe which opened in . in swiss immigrants, giovanni and pietro delmonico originally opened a pastry shop on william st about a block away from it is current location on beaver street. they soon started serving more than desserts and in delmonico's was officially a restaurant and by they opened their famed location on beaver street making it the city's first fine dining experience. delmonico's claims to have been the first restaurant in the country to offer a printed menu for its diners as well as the inventors of some classic dishes such as baked alaska, lobster newberg, andeggsbenedict. though the restaurant has not been operating within the delmonico family since the early 's you would not know that by anything you will experience here.having previously been to another historic nyc steakhouse peter lugar's est. and been completely underwhelmed by the food and ambiance i did not know what to think going to delmonico's. happily, i was very impressed with delmonico's. first of all i love the downtown area, the streets are smaller and have no order to them and it feels much more historic, like north boston. the restaurant is in a beautiful building in way intersection. once inside the restaurant i was even more impressed with their gorgeous interior. an interior that did not feel too old, too pretentious, too modern, too classy, or too casual. it was the perfect classy and comfortable atmosphere split between two floors and a number of rooms which kept everything from feeling too big or cavernous. the waiters, all in tuxes, did a good job of keeping the food coming and the drinks filled without feeling rushed. our waiter's personality was not the warmest by any means but he seemed like an eastern european which is a common trait in those cultures so i will not hold it against him. the prices are pretty high here but i would not exactly call them overpriced for the quality of the food and the experience is worth the splurge.as a side note they do operate a nd business with a separate entrance on the side of the building which is more of a classy bar and grill. this is where you can get their famedeggsbenedictand some more affordable dishes such as a burger or steak frites.i came here during restaurant week so i was able to get a course dinner for tax, tip, and drinks obviously not included . the meal started with a warm bread basket of very tasty seasoned rolls and butter. i order a beer which was brought to me in a bottle with a glass very similar to a wine glass. i started my meal with the scallop and corn appetizer. i was actually quite disappointed with this as i was served a single scallop that had been cut in half. i think this portion size was unacceptably low even for a nice restaurant and if i had to be served a single scallop that last thing i would want them to do to it would be to cut it in half for presentation purposes. still the dish was cooked and presented nicely. my date had gotten the lobster newberg a supplement which was their famous creation but in size portion which is actually a lobster . this was quite tasty and the sauce was very nice, my only complaint however is that the dish was described as coming with a caviar garnish something my date was eager to try for the first time and there was no caviar to be found on the dish. we both got the filet mignon for an entree and a chocolate peanut butter mouse for dessert. the filet mignon was served with mixed vegetables which consisted of carrots both the regular and the white variety as well as string beans. the vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned though i could have stood for a few more pieces . the filet was also cooked perfectly and was the best steak i have ever had. it was not fatty or overly seasoned and did not need any sauce whatsoever. though the portion was small, it was not too small by any means, i found the portion to be just right. i'm sad to say that even though i found the steak to be the best i've had my date said hers was not impressive and when i gave her a bite of mine she told me that hers was not as tender. the mouse for dessert was also pretty small but it was so rich that the small portion seems just right though i definitely would not have complained if the piece had been bigger . the mouse was smooth with the perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter flavor without either being overwhelming. overall though my service did not come with the biggest smile and the portion sizes left me a little underwhelmed, the ambiance and food was definitely something to write home about, as is the amazing history of the place. i will definitely be back next restaurant week, if not sooner."
2188,Teresa B.,1111,4,4/16/10,"delmonico's is a wall street culinary institution that has been in business since . the location and history alone is worth the visit.reading the menu and website will inform you that this was the birthplace ofeggsbenedict, lobster newburg, baked alaska and chicken ala king.delmonicosny.com about, ,a i was invited to a private function and the evening was memorable. the service was stellar and the food was great. i ordered a wedge salad, steak, and a side of creamed spinach.i will definitely remember delmonico's when i want to celebrate special occasions."
2189,Kyle W.,1111,5,3/4/10,"delmonico's is legendary, and it lived up to the legend.established in , delmonico's is the oldest restaurant in the united states. so, as a nyc history buff and a man that appreciates a fine steak, this was an amazing experience. just to give you some quick culinary history. you can thank delmonico's head chef in the 's charles ranhofer for creating chicken a la keen, lobster neuberg, baked alaska and my personal brunch fav,eggsbenedict.the ambiance is what you would expect from an established steakhouse in the financial district wood paneling, ornate details and rich drapery.i went with some colleges from we and we started off with cocktails they make a decent manhattan , then jumped into our main course.if you go to delmonico's you have to get their signature dish, perfected over the last years. the delmonico's steak! it is a healthy cut of meyer's all natural angus boneless rib eye. my mouth is watering just thinking about it. prepared medium rare is there any other way to prepare a steak it is tender and juicy, with enough fat to offer some real flavor. it is served with some flied onions. we shared family style sides for people, which was plenty given the size of the steak.for desert we sampled the baked alaska and the peanut butter chocolate mousse cake, both were great. but i do not thinks you can go wrong with their desert menu, everything looked amazing.overall, i had a fantastic experience at delmonico's! it ranks third in my list of favorite steak houses behind old homestead and peter luger's . due to the amazing steak and the historical allure, delmonico's is a must for any new yorker."
2190,Valerie B.,1111,5,11/22/08,"meat gooddrinks goodambiance goodprices not so good if you are not a big bank, lawyer or anyone with an expense account but if you are with said people and they are picking up the tab.then it is great!!!which is how i had the time honored chance to eat here. the filet mignon was sets of yummy and the sides that were chosen some potato dish, spinach and mushrooms were also wonderfully delightful.the added bonus is to be eating at a place with such history.opened since i think and the creator of many notable dishes like the baked alaska andeggsbenedict. with so much newness in ny it is great to eat somewhere that is been able to stick. if you get the chance and have profound love of steaks this is a must!!!"
2191,Alicia B.,1112,4,11/1/18,ordered the chicken chimichangas to start which was very yummy and found the sauce to go with it was tasty as well.for the entree my husband and i had a chicken taco and chicken burrito bowl with tortilla.my husband found the tacos to be small wish they were bigger. i enjoyed my burrito bowl.the place is very comfy with dining both inside and out. there is also a bar area to have somedrinks on the go.they also have television screens throught out on the inside if you want to keep abreast of the sports! with your favourite latin music playing on the inside.would recommend here as a spot to visit.
2192,Grace N.,1112,4,10/18/18,"ordered steak quesadilla, about bucks +tips .soft light crispy tortillas,cheese filling + tasty steak,come with sour cream + salsa.guacamole was tasty,flavorful, the pepper was crunchy, avocado was soft.tortillas chips was freshly fried.highly recommended!! plenty of seatings for couple, groups ."
2193,Puja P.,1112,1,10/17/18,"guys, guys, guys, i have so many feelings. and i only ordered three things that should be simple enough ! also i've worked near here for years and only just went here for the first time and now i know why. . grilled mexican corn. i mean, this was fine. acceptable, maybe but it was definitely boiled before it was lightly charred to masquerade as properly grilled. the texture was not satisfying. flavor, just ok. would i have it again no thank you. i have a huge bag of cotija cheese at home and now i have the motivation to make it myself. the redeeming factor was a order includes two ears of corn. . chicken flautas. the menu states that this is made with potatoes, so that itself was not a surprise when i got around to eating it. but i've had a decent number of flautas in my day and many potatoes and you know, when you cook potatoes, you need to season them! this was bland af. here is an email i sent to my coworker to whom i had offered a flauta are bland. do you know where to find hot sauce or any flavoring agents and want one there are , which i did not realize you will need the aforementioned hot sauce or flavoring agents though. the note i wrote on a postit for her, with a tiny packet of salt taped to it i cannot in good faith call this a present but you may eat it if you wish. you will need this salt if you do. i also coopted the limes from the elotes to fix the flautas. . tres leches cake. uh, i think you should know, when strawberries are brown it means they are rotten. the cake was fine. there is granulated sugar on top is that normal "
2194,Allix H.,1112,4,10/8/18,"we had come here on a friday night looking to try their margaritas. i will say, their menus are super cute. they look like passports, and the inside ceilings and walls are decorated. that was what initially drew me in as i was walking past the vicinity and i told myself i would be coming back to check it out.we had ordered a pitcher of the strawberry margarita. before that we had two drinks that were free if checked in on yelp. we showed it to the waitress and she asked to remind her at the end, but we did not remember and so we were charged the two margaritas. i mean it is not ideal to ask us to remind her when she knows we are ordering a pitcher of margaritas.we had also ordered the wings, which were good. even better after a few of those margaritas. i had also noticed the table behind me they were celebrating a birthday and were drinking a margarita tower!! i want to say these were around , and you cannot get one unless you have at least people in your party. aka i will probably need to come back again."
2195,Steve A.,1112,4,10/7/18,"it does not get better for mexican in the financial district than mad dog and beans. just the chips and guacamole is a pretty good meal. of course you need a margarita to quench your thirst. it is what you expect for prices. they are not too bad though.i had the classic margarita. it is about at happy hour. that is not too bad, and it was a large one. for the food i just had the salsa trio, which was enough since i recently ate. this includes pico de gallo, roasted tomato salsa, and salsa verde. it is about , which is higher than it should be for just salsa, though it tasted much better than typical. it was fresh. this did not taste like it came from a bottle, and the roasted tomato salsa and salsa verde both were mildly spicy.it has a good fun atmosphere. it is not too crazy and people are chill. this is one of many mexican restaurants around stone street, and it may be the best of them."
2196,Ameya B.,1112,3,8/31/18,"we were interviewing a candidate over lunch at this place, and were seated on the outside area where it is always packed on a summer friday. service is usually slow at most places and mad dog was not exception.i ordered the mad dog salad with chicken and my colleague ordered the grilled shrimp tostada . the salad is okay and the grilled chicken was really dry, so did not really enjoy that much.service was not that great. i was missing cuttlery and it took a long time to get one, even when i asked for it."
2197,Lana L.,1112,4,7/27/18,"good spot for drinks after work! came here on a friday a couple weeks ago mostly for the margarita towers i've heard about. it was super packed, but we were able to get a table that fit everyone people once most of the group was present. it was also super loud, especially upstairs.we shared two margarita towers guava and mango. i did not think the margaritas themselves were anything special, but the super tall margarita towers that they came in made it fun. they were also pretty strong margaritas! we also had wings and a large guac and chips . the guac and chips came with a lot of tomato, so i ate around it.taste | . atmosphere | . presentation | service | . overall | . "
2198,Darren B.,1112,4,11/1/18,"mad dog has a good location in the financial district among the cobblestone street. the appetizer i had was the chicken chimichangas which tasted great. unfortunately they only served and it was small. entree i had was the chicken tacos which tasted really well. they served four but they are small. the restaurant has a nice environment to talk to friends not too loud, screens for looking at sports highlights. the server was friendly and food did not take long to arrive."
2199,Atarah J.,1112,5,11/1/18,"tequila tequila tequila! stop here and indulge in the tequila !!!! great staff, awesome drinks, and guilty pleasure food. this is a great after work spot to kick back and relax. i would definitely recommend coming here. i usually get the tampique ]+a and share the margarita tower with friends. i am never disappointed!"
2200,Angie D.,1112,4,8/4/18,"i love coming to this place. eating outside in the summer time feels great!is always a mits to mits wait time though.their spicy guac. is sooo good. it has jalape ]+os in it. their mojito, coconut and pineapple is refreshing with fresh basil, its so tasty and so good! i had three! the skirt steak was delish. also the bell peppers that come with it as well.this place is perfect for a date, or just to hang out.fyi they play music really loud, so maybe depending on the type of date will matter."
2201,Pasquale R.,1112,5,5/29/18,"great food, service and location!it was a perfect spring day and were not planning on sitting outside but we scored a table for two right by the door way on the outside. score!it was lunch time so it was bustling.what to expect killer margarita's. they are served in plastic cups which makes me thing you can take them to go as long as your on stone st.maybe not.dunno.needless to say sit and eat there and order one.delicious, americanized mexican food save the burrito and order the bowl.and get a side order of chips to dip into it .yummy!ask for alej if you go there and receive great service.great people watching if sitting outside.mexican corn and sweet plantains are top in nyc, imo.nyc prices but worth it.the food is not over seasoned which seems to be the problem at most mexican spots.their guac, although not pictured, is definitely something you should order.enjoy!"
2202,Mel T.,1112,4,5/3/18,"stopped in for dinner on a tuesday night with a few friends at around , and the place was not too packed. at the time, i was on a nocarb diet, but there were not really any nocarb items on the menu. i went with the burrito bowl, but told them no rice. they really took care of me because they gave me a lot of extra steak instead no extra charge , and i left feeling stuffed. plus, it was pretty good.now that i'm back on carbs who was i kidding , i would not mind trying out some of their other menu items. the only thing that stinks is that they do not have any happy hour specials, so mad dog & beans if you are reading this, please get on that!"
2203,Anvita S.,1112,3,4/11/18,"tried the margarita tower which was great but pricy at for people they charged extra for mango passion fruit flavor . might be worth it to go with people to hit the sweet spot between price and quantity per person. we got about drinks out of it for girls.service was excellent, ambience is amazing, and food was.good. the chicken fajitas did not blow me away but the tacos at the table were a hit and easily finished they were on the small side . ended on an average tres leches.i got double charged on my credit card so watch out for that. oh and the door in the women's bathroom downstairs had a faulty lock so i was locked in for mins. hopefully they fixed that lol"
2204,Karen K.,1112,5,10/15/18,"i've been wanting to try this spot out for some time already. i work near by & i've heard many good news of this location. let us start off with those delicious corn on the cob pictures that others have posted. i have to admit i've never tried it but on this evening, i swear it was the best dish on the table. i also tried the shrimp tacos, dish comes with small soft she will & a small order of yellow rice & black beans. i came with friends so we doubled up on the guacamole, which is made fresh, great portion & very well seasoned. we were seated upstairs for dinner, with our own bar. the food came out at a decent time being that it was a packed evening. the location is well spaced out, downstairs seems to be more active by the music & limited seating. the drinks, oh that sex on the beach was so good. we each had cost each, they were strong & kicked in quick. the service was great, our waitress was attentive & friendly she was quick with getting our drinks. inside decor is cute with a  wouldias de los muertos' decor theme. the pop of color went well with the restaurant. i spent all weekend thinking of that corn on the cob! but we will back soon for more drinks!"
2205,Katharine S.,1112,4,5/10/18,this place is a dream in the summer. they are on stone street and have communal style outdoor seating.i recommend their blackberry margaritas and the guacamole! the guac is sooo good. a star for service
2206,Cristina G.,1112,4,4/22/18,"last time i ate here, the food was not so great, but i'm starting to think it was just the specific dish i ordered. last night, the food was bomb and the service at the bar was on point. win!i ordered the original w strawberry marg off your first one when you check in on yelp which was delicious and strong. up next i tried the regular margarita with salt and it was, of course, just as good. for dinner, i ordered a chicken burrito with no dairy, and the bartender nailed my order. it was smothered in delicious sauces and not a trace of dairy in sight. yes! you would not believe how many restaurants look at me like i'm crazy when i ask them to hold the dairy. our bartender was awesome though.the last time i came here, i ordered the chimichanga with steak. my suggestion is skip that dish and try something else because the other dishes do not disappoint."
2207,Jack M.,1112,1,10/13/18,"made a reservation for a large party. waited over an hour while the restaurant attempted to sort out the reservation only to discover that the group's table had been given away. was promised free shots and a table as soon as possible only to be told that we would not have a table. worst reservation experience ever.edit while my party and i spent several hours trying to resolve our issue at the restaurant, eventually we were able to speak to management about the experience who came out to meet our party at the adjacent restaurant . an honest effort was made to rectify the situation once the details had been sorted. while i regret that it took so long to resolve the situation, i very much appreciate the lengths management went to to make things right."
2208,Martina D.,1112,4,12/31/17,"this is one of those places where i really wish it were out of and not stars. i would give it a . but it does not deserve a or . the burritos are a good size, and i've never gotten anything that tasted stale. having said that, although the ingredients are good and fairly fresh, the price is a little steep for what you are getting.the tacos are good, and so are the burritos. my favorite thing about the burritos is that they come with a little container with sour cream, chopped up tomatoes, and guacamole, all neatly separated. i kind of wish the burritos came cut in half, but that is a personal preference. i switch off from ordering from here and another mexican restaurant, which has similar portions and prices. i tend to lean toward the other one just because you have the option to swap out rice for quinoa, and i'm trying to be a little healthier.i definitely like this place despite the few complaints. i will keep ordering from here for sure."
2209,Yuting G.,1112,4,8/14/18,similar to other reviews. this place has the best guacamole that i've ever had in the city!!!highly recommend to have the guacamole here.other food is just so so. the chicken wings come with wings! so it is a good deal to have the wings.i will simply come back again to hang out with friends with the guacamole.
2210,Lisa B.,1112,5,10/13/18,had delivery twice and it was delicious! tonight i tried the chicken enchilada's and i will definitely get them again. the corn is amazing and so were the chicken tacos. food arrived quickly and in it was still warm.my only suggestion would be not to order the nachos to go. unless they can come up with a clever way to package them. probably a bad move on my part. they were tasty but nachos togo is not very ideal. i'm sure they are delicious if you eat there. i would take a picture but all the food is gone.
2211,Marcel P.,1112,5,4/3/18,"you will not be disappointed if your looking for an authentic mexican spot, food is on point and service is exceptional. if you have a chance go to lacey's section, best waitress. she helped with what to order. and always came quick with water & drinks. was a great experience. thechickenchimichangasis so good. this is a must to order hands down!!! we will be back for sure."
2212,Ariana F.,1112,4,8/1/17,"i've been here times this summer and the food has been good every time. i've had the guacamole & chips, both types of sliders and the chicken chimichangas. the guacamole comes out fresh and delicious and the chips are nice and crispy. the sliders are little sliders that i have as a meal every time and they are perfect. thechimichangaswere crisp on the outside and stuffed perfectly on the inside and topped with sour cream, guacamole and cheese. the service is always good, attentive host and waitresses and i've never had to wait for a table even when the place is packed during weekday lunch hour around pm . i have not had a problem walking the few blocks there and back on my lunch break and being back at work within an hour. the restaurant is nice inside and there is plenty of seating downstairs and upstairs and the prices are great for the area."
2213,Dao L.,1112,5,6/20/17,"went here for yelp event. the food and service were on point!we were served mild guac and chips. the guac contained more tomatoes than i usually liked mine but the ratio kinda worked. it was delicious. the guac came in a large shallow bowl so it was misleading on the amount of guac. do not dip too much guac per chip lol. . also had, a strawberry, mango, and electric blue frozen margaritas with salt. yes, i am an alcoholic . the margaritas as well prepared as there is good amount of alcohol in them. i got tipsy on my first drink but i am also a light weight asian. next thing we had were grill corn with cheese. and o m g, it was so good. i inhaled the corn in less than a minute. the corns were prepared well, it contained all the moisture and the sweet juice from the corn goes well with the hint of spice they throw on it. highly recommend.later came thechickenchimichangas. it was good but nothing special. lastly, we had the churros with some strawberrys.now, i always get my churros from some random lady in subway station for . so that is what i compared it too. the churros in this place is undersized and a bit too hard in texture compared to the subway churros. the service ."
2214,Jillian L.,1112,4,6/20/17,"it is been a while since i had some good margs and mexican food. mad dog & beans totally hit the spot!this may be my new summer spot for margaritas! they have a ton of fruity flavors and they give you an option between frozen and on the rocks. the frozen margs are where it is at! the consistency is very smooth and not icy at all. they use fresh fruit purees to make their flavorings. i tried the frozen mango, frozen blood orange, strawberry on the rocks, and blackberry cucumber on the rocks. our server was nice enough to mix the two flavors for us. out of all, the blood orange frozen marg was my favorite.for food, we ordered the following large guacamole the guac was my favorite of the night! i think that i make a good guac, but i think mad dog may make a slightly better one.mexican corn perfectly charred and smothered in mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder. it comes on a stick for easy eating. i'm always a sucker for anything with mayo and cotija.chickenchimichangas my expectations forchickenchimichangasare low. i've had too many overly friedchimichangasstuffed with dry, flavorless shreddedchicken. thechickenchimichangasat mad dog are nicely fried and filled with moist, tastychickenand lots of cheese.churros w chocolate dipping sauce the only way to cap off the night. enough said.overall, mad dog & beans is a great place for mexican food! the food and drinks are on point and the staff is super friendly! looking forward to coming back soon!"
2215,Diane H.,1112,4,6/20/17,"margaritas, margaritas, margaritas!!!!my top choices are passion fruit, spicy, and cucumber, made with their house tequila.their guacamole is really good and made fresh! i had spicy but it definitely could be more spicy. still tasty though!also thechickenchimichangaswere delicious! looks a bit small, but actually was filling!! the corn was alright, not like the mexican corn i'm used to having back in california. & the churros with chocolate was slightly above average chocolate was very similar to the ones i've had in spain yum! , but the churros were alright.overall i would definitely come back again for their margaritas!"
2216,Des R.,1112,4,9/10/16,drinks were excellent. not too crowded for a sunday evening on a holiday weekend. there was only one waitress though and she was slightly overwhelmed.blood orange margaritas are my favorite from here and we have officially decided the appetizer menu is where it is at. try the guacamole and thechickenchimichangas. food carries much spice so be careful if you are sensitive to that sort of thing.if you are in the financial district stop by. it is worth it.
2217,Ericka S.,1112,3,3/10/13,"i've been to mad dog and beans for lunch as well as drinks & appetizers. overall, md & b is a solid mexican spot. the atmosphere is nice it is well decorated and it has a cool vibe. if you enter from the pearl st. side, it can be a little confusing to get a seat, because you have to walk to the other side to see the person who will seat you. minor inconvenience, but it is no big deal.you must have the guacamole it is made fresh and you can have it mild, medium, and spicy to your taste. the tortilla chips are light and not too greasy. they complement each other well. the salsa is also good. i've tried thechickenchimichangas,chickenflautas, nacho appetizers. very delicious! from a drinks perspective, i have tried the sangria and it was very good.this is definitely a solid place in fidi, and a good place to have drinks and food. it is a little pricey, but considering where it is located, i am not surprised. if i was craving mexican in the area, i would go to mad dog and beans."
2218,Sim D.,1112,3,1/5/13,"this is the closest mexican place from where i live, sometimes i come here when i do not feel like going too far for food. overall the food here is ok, a little bit over price. thechickenchimichangasis kind of unique, also the guacamole chips & salsa, grilled mexican corn and mexican hot wings are good as well, mahi mahi taco with guacamole is also a must try.what makes this place better is definitely the margaritas, there are many different flavors, mango, coconut, cucumber, blue margarita, etc. kind of strong but very impressive."
2219,Heidi G.,1112,3,5/31/12,"service was very slow, but once we finally got waited on the food and drinks came quickly. sangria was just ok, mychickenchimichangaswere very good. my husband'schickentacos had small pieces of bones in them and the beans and rice that was served with his meal were not very tasty. my son had a burrito that was huge, he really enjoyed it."
2220,Nicole M.,1112,3,3/6/18,this place is great for appetizers. i shared theirquesofundido amazing and medium guac with chips which was also excellent. the shrimp tacos were extremely bland and the pulled pork tacos were very dry and had an orangey tang to it. def was not a fan of either taco would say they kind of sucked. our waitress lorena was the sweetest cutie ever and so good at her job. will be coming back but only for apps. toloache has much better tacos as does tacombe and pretty much everywhere else. you guys need to up your taco game!
2221,Melissa M.,1112,5,6/17/17,"came to this place based on the yelp reviews and it did not fail me! great food, great staff, and amazing environment. i had thequesofundidoand the steak cesar salad and both were amazing! do not forget to try a hurricane while you are here."
2222,Evian D.,1112,5,3/24/14,"ok, so let me start by saying why i was hesitant to trying this place out . yelp reviews were very mixed, could not be sure if food was great or not . my friends have come here for drinks by never tried food so i had no real opinion from friends . it is deep in financial district and i live in hell's kitchen . the place does not sell authentic mexican but then again, most places in nyc are actually texmex and not real mexicanwith that said, what everyone agrees on is that this place has awesome strong margaritas, and i love margaritas!!! but it does not stop there, the food is actually very good. in fact, thequesofundidowas one of my favorites yet, full of peppers and onions and tomato chunks that made each bite a delicious succulent mouthful of fresh condiments with warm cheese on a warm tortilla flat! we also ordered the sliders and the nachos. again, another pleasant surprise, the buns were crisp yet soft and warm full with a generous helping of the meat. the salsa was thick and not watered down and fresh and gone too quickly well, what can i say, i love salsa and chips the margaritas were amazing, and to have such a good selection of tequilas was very nice!shout out to the frida and to partida tequilas on the menu for not a bad price considering the cup comes full!the feel maybe more of an upscale chillies. but with the space. this is a perfect space to come and chill after work or with good friends, get a table and drink some great margaritas and share the bites in between!!i absolutely loved it and am planning to be back several times with my friends.as my tradition, i really do think this is a great place for a fun second and third date and make it a spot because the lighting is low, the music is cool, and the staff is super friendly and margaritas definitely help keep the party going!!!good job mad dog!!!reasons why i would return . tequila list is great . different bites full of flavor . happy hours are half price margaritas . the bartender amanda was sweet and friendly and offered her advice on best picks from the menu! . ambiance is comfy and rustic but also can be romantic"
2223,Erin C.,1112,3,9/2/11,"if you have to travel a great distance to visit this restaurant, it might not be worth it. we ate the guacamole,quesofundido, and a shrimp enchilada. we ordred the guacamole spicy and loved when it came out with a pile of chopped jalapeno peppers on top. it was fresh and delicious. thequesofundidowas pretty good however, the cheese could have been a better quality and it was too large of an appetizer for two people. i do not think we would order this again. the enchilada was pretty good. it might have lacked some excitement, but was still tasty. we also had the classic margarita on the rocks. this was also pretty good, but i believe they have added sugar into the mix. the sugar killed the fresh flavors and the tequila flavor. the best part of this restaurant is that it is located on stone street. the outdoor area was absolutely lovely and exciting. we will definitely be returning to this restaurant. it is not an authentic style mexican restaurant, but it has all the cheesy, saucy goodness of a texmex restaurant."
2224,Donna H.,1112,3,8/30/11,"the atmosphere could be okay, but sadly the restaurant more often than not seems to be overrun by frat boy and exfrat boy but still living the dream wall street types. so then why do they get a thequesofundido. my god thequesofundido! have you ever eaten something so delicious that it brings tears to your eyes with each bite you think, it cannot be as good as i remember! but then you take another bite and it is! that is what thisquesofundidois. so if you are lucky enough to live close by, delivery!!!"
2225,Henali P.,1112,5,4/13/11,amazing mexican food & strong margaritas!! thequesofundido& guac are deliciousss.
2226,Amy C.,1112,3,6/5/09,"i came here with some girlfriends tonight for dinner. our initial collective reaction was simple awe at how high the prices were. i kept joking about how even chipotle is overpriced for rice, beans, and carnitas at about per person. at this place, our bill came up to per person there was of us so you can do the math .we all shared one platter of nachos the one thing that keeps bringing back my friend who suggested the place . the nachos did live up to the high expectations she would set up for me. as my main course, i ordered appetizers the tuna ceviche yummy! andquesofundido too heavy and too oily . i also tried a bite of my friend's steak quesadilla which i thought the meat was overcooked and the flour tortilla was undercooked.for dessert, i ordered the churros with melted chocolate dipping sauce. the churros were delicious, but the chocolate sauce was so watered down i could barely taste the chocolate. one of my friends ordered the churros with tres leches dipping sauce and she also reported that her sauce was very watered down. our waiter brought out a mad dog cake a flourless chocolate cake served with fresh fruit and drizzled in chocolate sauce on the house. the cake was not warmed thoroughly and tasted like it was sitting out for a while. it also sat in a shallow pool of the same watered down chocolate sauce that came with my churros.our waiter was nice and we all loved the music and decor. if i go back, i would definitely order the nachos and ceviche again."
2227,Christopher P.,1112,4,7/31/08,"the food here is good, though nothing i've tried is remarkable. i'm quite happy to have a new choice of food down in this area. unfortunately, like everything else in the immediate area, it is overpriced and the drinks are stingy. the service is very friendly, but it can be slow when they are busy.i found the food to be surprisingly authentic. they serve freshmade guacamole in a molcajete, though it is not made at your table like at rosa mexicano. the tacos are made with small corn tortillas as they should be, and the serving of four leaves you just enough room to snack on guac or another dish.thequesofundidois served with the same tasty little tortillas. like any good authenticfundidohas more veggies in it than the typical cheeseandmeatinabowl disaster of the same name the veggies makes it sit less heavily in your stomach and add a lot of great flavor.the tampiquena is a great carne asada with lots of fixings. if i get guac before the meal, i cannot finish it all.if you are looking for a larger serving of texmex, the fajitas are good, though no different than you would find anywhere else. i have not tried the burritos, as i can get that sort of texmex fare anywhere. someone else here complained about the size of the tacos. anyone complaining about tacos not being of the absurd usual american size has clearly never had real mexican food and can be safely ignored when reading reviews of mexican restaurants. most common mexican foods are served from street carts and are made to be good for holding in your hand and snacking on. huge tacos and burritos of the american style simply do not exist there. "
2228,Angela T.,1112,3,3/9/18,"this is a great hang out place and definitely good on a friday night if you want to feel buzzed. the vibe was great, the waitresses were nice, however they do get busy and swamped, so the service might not be the best during busy hours. i waited min before i got my utensils and water after being seated, so if you are looking for great service might not be good to come during busy hours.we ordered the giant liter tower of blood orange margarita appetizer mexicanhotwings entrees steak enchiladas with rice and beans , pulledpork burrito bowl , and the fish taco with a side of rice and beans we only had people, which means one liter per person. we should have gone with more people. the prices were decent especially in the fidi location. the foods were mediocre, very typical spanish cuisine. thewingswere seasoned very well with just the right amount of spices, not too spicy. the pulledpork came with the finishing touch of crisp on the top which was nice. rice and beans were very typical. fish taco and steak enchiladas were very typical like any other spanish restaurant. the drink was strong, we each had about glasses and we were buzzed for the rest of the night. they also give yelp checkin % off the first drink, so it is not a bad place to come after work if you are in the neighborhood."
2229,Tara B.,1112,3,5/3/17,visited today nice decor fast seating at around lunch time. we ordered themexicanhotwings no spice at all. just color steak nacho very good grilled corn no flavor enchiladas good from what i heard from my boss . overall nice spot will come back to do happy hour and try the margaritas.
2230,Timmy H.,1112,5,6/27/16,i recently just started working in the fidi area and decided to check this place out. the frozen margaritas here are awesome! the tequila menu is very impressive and has a wide variety of different tequilas available. i would highly recommend this place to anyone in town looking for a cool spot to have a few drinks after work especially if tequila and margaritas are your thing. i have not tried much of the food yet just themexicanhotwingswhich were great! i will definitely be back and am excited to try some of the other appetizers and entrees on the menu.
2231,Brittany J.,1112,4,5/17/16,great queso fundito &mexicanhotwings. their margaritas are pretty awesome too. great atmosphere for after work. meet some characters in this place.
2232,Thomas D.,1112,4,7/18/15,i liked this place. the food was a little expensive but get themexicanhotwings. those are really good! the drinks are good and for me strong and i am ft lbs.
2233,Grace B.,1112,4,7/5/15,"great place to go for good times and food. came here for dinner right before the th of july fireworks. the hostess was great in accommodating our party of as we kept changing our mind on being seated outdoors or indoors to try to make sure we had plenty of time to catch the fireworks.we finally ended up being seated indoors upstairs no wait time and were promptly approached by our server. when we did not have our drink orders ready yet, she briskly left. we finally placed our drink and appetizer orders. i got a frozen margarita unflavored which cost and was surprisingly sweet flavorful and strong! for appetizers, we gotmexicanhotwingswhich were for wingsand came with dipping sauces and cole slaw although they were very flavorful without the sauces. we also got guacamole, medium spicy which had a nice hint of spiciness without being overwhelming in flavor. i ordered the gorditos which are actually listed in on the appetizer section but the portion size is large enough for it to be more than filling for an entree. i got the corn tortillas with chicken in them. yummy! love the green sauce that comes with it and the corn tortillas are so dense, soft, and moist!the vibe downstairs is also great and the place always seems to be packed. a solid choice for a guaranteed good time with friends any day of the week."
2234,J C.,1112,5,6/2/15,"visited a few times. loves their guacamole andmexicanhotwings! margarita is delicious. great place, very relaxed atmosphere but a bit too dark. will definitely go back."
2235,Matthew P.,1113,5,11/8/18,good eating.absolutely good eating!!!get a pastramni and corned beef sandwich and do not look back!
2236,Andre C.,1113,5,11/8/18,"this is one of those classic new york experiencespastrami , corned beef, lots of pickles and beer!the crowds and the waiting in line are a bit overwhelming but all tourists love it"
2237,Pete F.,1113,3,11/7/18,"i would like to know where new yorkers go for pastrami's. when i was there, everyone looked like tourists. i have to believe new yorkers do not pay for a pastrami sandwich, no matter how good it is.for me, it is a once and done. the pastrami was very good. but we have equally good pastrami at langers back home. and i do not experience nearly the sticker shock, including for a scoop of slaw.and that outdated new york attitude i can do without. is that intentional for the tourists or do they just really do not give a f. the only smile i got was from the cashier. call me old fashion but a few smiles would be nice when i m shelling out for a soup and sandwich with a side of slaw."
2238,Amy R.,1113,3,11/5/18,this is quintessential nyc. be prepared to wait! suggestions . split a sandwichthey are huge seriously like over a pound of meat on each! avg sandwich . seat yourself and order at counter this takes less time and is part of the experience . drink water sodas are like . do not go during regular mealtimes line can be around the block . enjoy it for the experience!
2239,Adrian A.,1113,5,11/2/18,"why cannot i give this place stars or even ! this place is literally the embodiment of what a sandwich should taste like. if god goes down from the heavens to eat a sandwich, i am % sure he or she would eat here. this deli joint feels like a dmv from the inside with disneyland lines from outside to their order counters. the employees are the best as well because they give this place that nyc feel, hardworking, tough looking, but very helpful. they have collection of pictures of famous people on all of their walls and that is a sight to behold. anyway. leggo on the food shall we.i ordered their pastrami sandwich, which is melt in your mouth.their sandwich is simple a meat which is pastrami for me and a rye bread. their meat feels like butter when you are eating it. i am actually having foodgasm by just describing it. their rye bread is thick enough to hold that juicy, meaty goodness, not to mention it is best the best dough in the business, as well. my girlfriend ordered their corned beef, which we shared half and half. this, too have the same quality as the pastrami, so you can nevet go wrong ordering what.for the our refreshments, we ordered their egg cream shake. so good, taste like a way better version of an eggnog. it is the right drink to compliment the best sandwich i ever had. yes, i said it! no doubt about it! overall, if i get bored, i would go to nyc for a day just to eat here. that is how i love this place ps hey why is my picture not on those walls ! i am famous being yelp elite lolpss i can only dream haha"
2240,Renee C.,1113,5,11/4/18,"this is a nyc bucket list destination, and it is also good as hell. when i went there, i was initially overwhelmed with the restaurant system when you enter, they give you a ticket, and when you leave, you give them back that ticket.i ordered a pastrami sandwich they give you slices to sample, and it was perfect. i knew i was going to have an enjoyable gustatory experience. the pastrami was perfectly warm, and the mustard was perfect. it was the best pastrami sandwich i have had in my life! they also sell these craft sodas, and the diet cherry coke does not even taste like diet!i'm not going to lie, the sandwich is a bit pricey . ! , so it is not a place i will be frequenting often, but it is a place that i need to go to once every months."
2241,Hung N.,1113,4,11/2/18,there is one in houston where i live. i have always wanted to go to the original one in new york. we got that chance today it was an interesting experience.when you walk in they give you a ticket even if you are not eating. that is how they keep track of people and keep them from trying anything sneaky because you have to provide the ticket when you leave and use it to pay. we opted to go to the counter and order directly from the chefs. we got the pastrami on rye cuz you just have too. it came with a pickle and a slightly pickled cucumber. i must say it was quite good. i added their mustard and it it spiced it up even more. it had a great smokey salty flavor and they pile the meat pretty high.i'm glad i was able to take this off my bucket list and they did not disappoint.
2242,Victoria O.,1113,5,11/6/18,my review from years ago disappeared.best chopped liver in the world.best pastrami in the world.best franks in nyc. that magical crisp of the casing when you bite into the dog.matzoh ball soup good but not as good as nd ave deli.terribly crowded so do not expect to get in and out in minutes. even the takeout line is long.the ticket system for entry and exit is confusing and bizarre. do not lose your ticket.cole slaw great and the portion is huge.
2243,Tiffany P.,1113,5,10/18/18,"is . for a pastrami sandwich worth yes!after seeing the amount of reviews this place had and how expensive a typical sandwich can cost, i had doubts about this place! ugh, i was totally wrong. this pastrami sandwich was the best i have ever tasted. literally. the texture of the meat was just so juicy and plain, how can that sound so tasteful right the serving was a good sharing portion if you are not too hungry. they also serve pickles and cucumbers on the side to go with your sandwich.this place left me missing new york "
2244,Saxon M.,1113,5,10/14/18,"this is the best sandwich i've ever had. not being dramatic. get the reuben sandwich with the pastrami. it is melt in your mouth good. love the character & history of this place. the pickles & cucumbers are a great addition.btw the ticket system is kind of confusing if you have never been here. when you walk in everyone gets a blue ticket. this ticket is where your order is written on. you have to have one to exit, even if it is blank. if you try to exit without a ticket they will charge you ."
2245,Linda W.,1113,3,10/21/18,the cutters are super cool and give you samples before cutting the rest of the meat.the guy at the front door was rude and annoying though.pastrami on rye was as good as i remember.tons of meat!!
2246,Cynthia D.,1113,4,10/19/18,"i've heard about this place for years from online reviews and food tv shows so when in nyc recently, i made it a point to check it out.it is everything that you expect if you have seen photos watched a show that featured the place. old school dinerlike atmosphere, friendly employees and expensive but huge! sandwiches with freshly cut meat. i will agree with what someone else said since i think it accurately describes my feelings as well it is delicious but i would not say life changing. we got there around pm and there was no line to get in, however, there were lines behind each counter inside there are maybe of them . we did not have to wait long to order though the counter line we got in only had two parties in front of us and it moved pretty quickly. we ordered the hot pastrami sandwich that came with cheese and mustard on it and an assortment of pickles on the side. we also had an onion bagel with cream cheese and tomato . there were two of us and we shared both items it was a lot of food. we did not even finish everything! the hot pastrami sandwich was good but typically i like my pastrami cut thinner. i also think the mustard is a necessary addition to the sandwich. it was very dry when i would get a bite that was just the bread, meat and cheese and i was happy they had more mustard available at the tables.overall, we enjoyed the experience and it is fun to dine in and see all the old pictures and feel like you are part of something that is remained pretty unchanged for many years in the city. however. i will say that i feel this way because we were able to get right in, get some food and enjoy. if i had waited min or more to just get in the door, i do not think i would have been as pleased. i do not think the food is that great that it is worth the long wait times. just my two cents!"
2247,Katie L.,1113,2,10/9/18,"go to sarge's on th rd ave for a hefty pastrami sandwich and quintessential nyc experience! they put the deli in delicious, not katz's.after hanging out in the les, katz's pastrami sandwich and a cream soda sounded like a winning combo at am. however, expect some attitude on the side, especially by the bouncer harassing people for tickets when they leave. a great way to swindle more money from unassuming latenight patrons, who are not paying attention to a raffle ticket handed to them at the beginning of the meal. i misplaced mine briefly, and they were not going to let me exit. i did find it stuffed in one of my pockets, but their attitude was find it.or else .the pastrami sandwich itself is fine, if a bit fatty and hardly lb like they advertise. it is large enough to share with a friend, if you do not want your digestion to work overtime at the crack of dawn. harry & sally's table is clearly marked, to the delight of my movie fanatic friend, who made sure to sit underneath the sign. overall ok to do once, hopefully without the bouncer exchange at the end. i still say go to sarge's in murray hill all the way!"
2248,Kevin S.,1113,5,11/2/18,"i've been going to katz's for many many years.and to be honest even though the place has raised their prices the food is as awesome as ever.over for a pastrami sandwich at most places would make me think about going in there,however katz's over stuffs these sandwiches and when ever i ate a pastrami sandwich there it was yes stuffed and juicy.added to that the home made fries and a couple of cans of dr.browns cel ray soda.i'm always around that area ans the place is never empty,especially on a thurssat night when people are going to the nearby bars and clubs there is a line outside for people to enter.one of the best deli's for their food,atmosphere and amazing staff!!!!"
2249,Jacob D.,1113,5,11/4/18,"sandwiches so good. did not know what to expect as i made the line on a saturday. lots of tourists making their patronages. but it was worth it. wait was not too long even though we were wrapped around the side of the building. they hand you a ticket as you walk in for each person . do not lose it. if you do they assume you got two sandwiches and two sodas which is around . you head to whichever cut station has the shortest line when you get in. tip go in to the cut station furthest from the door, generally the shortest line.you pick your meat and they give you a plate with some small slices to taste to let them know you like it.their pastrami is what they are known for from instagram and it is so delicious. a little more fatty than the corned beef sandwich which i got as well, so that gives it a little more flavor and a leg up over the corned beef. matzo ball soup, superb. it is a huge ball so you could probably share it between two if you are getting sandwiches. got sides of fries and coleslaw yum as well.tables have ketchup and mustard. mustard is good. add extra to your sandwiches.if you are paying with credit card, go to the counter beyond the cut stations."
2250,Pam B.,1113,3,11/4/18,"long drive from hotel, and wait outside and get ticket inside, which you must present to show payment or pay a fee. had pastrami sandwich & potato salad which i did not like, too much mayo. sandwich was not that large, pastrami flavor and tenderness were lacking, bread was dry. have had better pickles too. other diner had turkey that was on dry side. cheesecake was disappointing, in texture and flavor. waiter seemed annoyed for most requests. would not go back, very disappointed. miss other popular deli that has closed."
2251,Emily C.,1113,5,10/6/18,"katz's is definitely an iconic spot in nyc and is so well known for their pastrami. there is usually a huge line so either come really early before the crowd gets there or come really late when it is way past dinner time. i came really late for a late night option and did not have to wait at all. the cutters are not too friendly, actually depends on who you are. i had a cutter who was friendly to the customer in front of me but was indifferent towards me.once you walk in, each person is handed a ticket regardless if you plan to order or not. make sure you do not lose your ticket since it is your way out too. then you go up to any cutter station and order from the cutter. they would give you a small sample of the meat that you chose while you wait and then write the price on the ticket. there is a separate counter for ordering fries. after finishing your meal, you exit by handing in your ticket and paying.i tried the famous katz's pastrami on rye and added swiss cheese. the pastrami was absolutely delicious. it was so tender and practically melted in my mouth. the mustard that they have on the table adds a nice contrast of flavor to the meat. the cheese was placed in between the cuts of pastrami which made it melt a little and tasted great. the bread was also soft and soaks up the juices from the pastrami but does not get soggy. they also give you types of pickles one is definitely more pickled than the other but the sourness and crunch factor is necessary.i definitely think that it is a must try spot since the meat was so delicious but it is definitely pricey. be prepared to spend at least on one sandwich."
2252,Alexandria T.,1113,5,11/5/18,"pastrami was amazing, the sandwich is huge and big enough to share. i had a hotdog cooked well done, it was okay, def good for the price. the hotdog was juicy and the skin was a little thicker than i personally prefer.the line was incredibly long, we first got in line a bit outside. we still got our food in ~ minutes"
2253,Alyssa P.,1113,2,10/2/18,"ummm. i feel like i'm in lala land. the food was. kinda tasteless. kinda bland. kinda flavorless. kinda not worth all the talk. kinda wondering what is going on with yelp. kinda think this is one of those places that became a thing and everyone pyschs themselves into thinking it is amazing.anyways. service was not that great. server had an edge. who would have thunk it. a nyer with an edge lol.anywho they have the stupidest ticket rule. they are killing trees to hand out ticket number. your ticket gets written on when you pay for food. if you do t get any food, you must return the ticket. lost tix are .so you order the food, someone writes on the ticket then you take your ticket to pay for the food.why on earth do not you order your food, pay for it and wait like other places i have not idea. crowd control i suppose and that just means they need to reconfigure the ordering process."
2254,Jenilee C.,1113,4,11/1/18,"this place is a zoo, and for good reason. we got there mid afternoon, on a monday, thinking we would have a short wait and i guess you could probably consider a minute wait short at katz's.they keep you moving through the line as quick as they can, to get you to the cutters. it seemed quicker for us to order at the counter than the people who were separated and waiting to be seated and order at the table.we had our heart set on a reuben which we are familiar with the corned beef version. our cutter was kind enough to suggest we try both that and the pastrami before we committed, and i'm so glad he did. the pastrami is where it is at. it was so moist i know everyone loves that word and delicious, it was not a fair fight. my mom and i were able to split one sandwich comfortable and it was served with a variety of pickles. they stack the sandwich high with meat, russian dressing and sauerkraut. the only thing i would have changed is the option to toast the bread, as we normally do. but i would still eat it again untoasted. well done katz's!"
2255,James A.,1113,5,2/18/18,"food is great but pretty pricey. i would recommend going here if you have never been at least for the experience of tasting a new york city food institution.i had thekatz'scornedbeefhotsandwichon rye with mustard and the matzo ball soup. the rye was soft like it was baked that day. thecornedbeefwas so full of flavor and had the perfect fallapartyourmouth texture you expect from goodcornedbeef. the matzo ball soup had one nice big matzo ball that was not overcooked like some others and the broth was nice and balanced. would be a great soup for a cold day if you are not feeling well. if you live close enough, they deliver! both thecornedbeefhotsandwichon rye and the matzo ball soup were perfect examples of new york city culinary mainstays.sometimes there is a line outside but it usually moves pretty quick so do not let that keep you from stopping by if you see a large queue out the front door."
2256,Kait A.,1113,5,1/29/18,"if you are craving a pastramisandwich, you will not be disappointed. yes, this place is a bit touristy and expensive due to how famous it is from when harry met sally, but i will not like. it is a greatsandwich. prepare to wait. or come early and beat the lunch rush. hold on to your ticket!! bring cash!!absolute must katz'spastramihotsandwich . russian dressing. mustard. rye bread. tons of meat. delicious. steak fries . also good katz'scornedbeefhotsandwich . square potato knish . round knish with potato . i always go for the pastrami because i just cannot help it. theircornedbeefis also amazing you can order it lean if you would like by the way. thesandwichesare huge so you could definitely share one if you are not starving."
2257,Marie Y.,1113,3,9/12/17,first time being in ny. first stopkatz's. no debate. landed at am and we still went to get pastrami as our first meal luggage in tow.we arrived to a super empty restaurant. we were actually the only ones there. the guard hands you a ticket and you approach the counter. they take your order and get to work. while they are making you yoursandwichthey give you samplings of the meats to get your approval. after completing the order they ask for your ticket stamp what you go and give you back your ticket. you take your trays to any open spot and chow down.we ordered the katz'scornedbeefhot sandwich our secret dry cure pickling formula requires a full month to be ready to serve.i really did not enjoy thecornedbeef. the meat tasted bad. like it went bad.katz'spastramihot sandwich smoked to juicy perfection and hand carved to your specifications.the pastrami was good . should have just gotten a whole of the pastrami.after your meal you head to the cashier hand them your ticket and pay cash.overall i thought there was too much hype. i prefer la's langers. there i just said it. running away.
2258,Kelli S.,1113,4,7/5/17,"visitingkatz'sdeli is probably the # thing people recommend when you tell them you are going to nyc, as far as food goes. we made it to the famous deli on memorial day at around p.m. we did not really set a time for our visit, but it ended up being a good time to go. there were still people in there dining, but it was not nearly as hectic as i'm sure it can be during the traditional lunch hour.you get a ticket when you come in one per person and you can either go to the deli counter to order yoursandwich, or you can opt to be waited on. a section of the restaurant is reserved for those who want to be led to a table and served, and part of the restaurant is for those who order for the counter and seat themselves. i knew this going into the restaurant because a friend had told me. however, it was still so overwhelming to order from the counterpeople were hording the spaceso i just asked if we could be seated and have a server. you have to retain your ticket that you get and turn it in when you leave lost tickets a fee and you pay for your meal when you leave.since the deli is crowded, they make use of every square inch. we were seated at a longer table and shared it with another couple. the boyfriend preferred to order oursandwichtogo and enjoy it in a more peaceful place, but he did not mind the crowd so much once our meal actually came.katz'smenu is hugethere is a lot you can choose frombut it is not a booklike spread like sarge's menu. there are a fewhotsandwichesand coldsandwichesyou can choose from, but there is also a breakfast menu, grill favorites and a bunch of specials you can choose from. since this was our first visit and everyone raves about the reuben, we just decided to share that, but there is plenty of options if you want to try something different.since it was not as crowded as it could be here, considering how famouskatz'sis, our food came out relatively quickly. it was delicious, in a different way that our sarge'ssandwichwas, and i'm glad we made it here to try that famoussandwich.here's what we got reuben of course, when you go tokatz's, you have to get either the pastrami or the reuben. since we had sarge's reuben the day before, we had to compare! we ordered the reuben fromkatz's, which featuredcornedbeef, swiss cheese and a russian and sauerkraut combo. this was a closedsandwich not open faced like sarge'ssandwich , and it still contained a generous portion of that juicy, tender meat. but, i felt like thissandwichhad more ingredients in it at least more of the mixins. i could really taste the cheese and there was more sauerkraut. our reuben from sarge's was more straightup meat and less fuss and frills. the twosandwicheswere slightly different to us and tasted slightly different so we could not determine which was better, per say. we appreciated eachsandwichfor what it was.katz'ssported a smoky flavor and the meat was super tender. i loved how i could taste more of the cheese and sauerkraut in this one, and whatever russian sauce they used was killer! i can see what all the hype was about. we shared thesandwich, but since i was still full from lunch, i only had a few bites and let the boyfriend indulge in the rest. katz'scornedbeef if i ever came here again, i would want to try thecornedbeefhotsandwich. i think when it comes to the meatier options, i preferhotsandwichesover coldsandwiches. this version sounds good it features the eatery's secret dry cure pickling formula that requires a full month to be ready to serve. katz'spastrami the boyfriend and i agreed we would probably want to try this famous pastrami the next time, since it also came highly recommended. the meat is smoked to juicy perfection and hand carved to your specifications. rumor has it that you do not need mayo for this one . the meat is just that flavorful all on its own!new york cheesecake if i had room for dessert here, i would want to order one of the famous nystyle cheesecakes! creamy and sinful, this cheesecake is supposed to be fluffy, delicious and a musthave for any dessert fiend. i cannot wait to try it one day. and i would just get it plain no fruit toppings necessary."
2259,Eric S.,1113,4,6/5/16,"she will have what i'm having.uuunnnggghhhh well here we are, at one of the most famous businesses in all of new york, which thus makes it one of the most popular places in the world with nearly k yelp reviews. our last day in manhattan found us on the lower east side. knowing that we could not leave without getting a legendary pastrami on rye, we stopped in at pm on a tuesday and the place. was. packed. this was not a weekday lunch rush mind you, just business as usual for this landmark jewish delicatessen.the system works as such every person that walks in the door gets a ticketdo _not_ lose this ticketand heads to the slicing counter. something like or cutting stations servecornedbeef,hotdogs, salami hard or soft , and pickles. from there, it is a waiting game until you reach the front of the line. each carver will give you a free sample of whatever meat you desire, kinda nice of them.once that is done, find yourself a seat good luck . crowds will likely be heavy at any all hours of the day, so plan accordingly. i would recommend that one person in your group scout a table while the others wait in line for meaty sustenance. speaking of food.every order comes with varieties of pickles is considered a fresh pickle essentially a cucumber that is brighter in color, while the other is a more traditional sour gherkin. these are a refreshing addition to any lunch plate and is just one of the many things that has putkatz'son the map.besides those yummy pickles, we enjoyed a good quality bowl of the matzah ball soup . we also got an order of latkes aka potato pancakes for those came with sour cream and applesauce. a plate of fries was , which is straight up ridiculous. cans of soda are . the pastramisandwichis a whopping and comes with a whopping lb ofhot, juicy meat. i recommend the deli mustard to go with it. unlike carnegie deli, atkatz'syou are more than welcome to shareand you should, since it is a huge portion.bread . circuses yup, the totally hilarious scene with meg ryan and billy crystal from 'when harry met sally' was filmed here. you know, the part where they meet up for lunch and billy's character says something to the effect of men can tell when women fake an orgasm , so meg's character says something like watch this , and then does all the moaning and whatnot, yada yada yada. director rob reiner's mother, estelle, then proceeds to deliver perhaps one of the greatest lines in the history of film. i do not think i have to tell you what it is. in fact, it is such a flawless bit, it was voted rd on the list of alltime best movie quotes. there is a nice sign recognizing the moment.due to the cultural significance, i'm proud to call it my th uploaded photo.elsewise, the ticketing method was weird. i understand the purpose to discourage theft of reubensandwiches , but the bouncers at the door came across as overlyaggressive. if you lose your ticket, that is a bullsh t fee. no ticket no exit. do not pass go. do not collect pastramis. cash only, so come prepared with an assload of paper money.in closing,katz'sdeli is simply one of those 'must see' places. much like central park or times square, this restaurant has withstood the test of time and is essential for those vacationing in nyc. deal with the crowds, deal with the cost, and get a delicioussandwich.as for fake orgasms that will cost you an extra .____________ for those of you wondering did eric s have a stroke earlier the answer is no this is what climaxing might sound like if converted to text i would not know, and do not bother asking my girlfriend either! hiyo! double extra points my review is # , forkatz'sdeli, which is quite literally the breast timingi mean best timingever. but seriously, if somebody was going to be the th reviewer, it might as well be me. and why not most of my postings are already saturated with dirty puns and sexual innuendi, and if you think giggling at the number is too juvenile, then i weep for your lack of levity."
2260,Lee P.,1113,3,4/5/16,"i guess east coasters have different deli standards than chicagoans. who is to say who is right. i thought thekatz'scornedbeefwas minimally seasoned and just ok. the rye bread was without caraway seeds and kind of bland. the dill pickle was nothing special. compared to manny's delicatessen in chicago,katz'sdoes not stand a chance.it is an experience dining here. i stood in line for a table, which turned out to be the wrong way to go. you should go right up to one of the cutters and place an order, then there are plenty of open seats in the back. but at least i got to sit with a couple from scranton, pa who own a bar and grill there. i asked the guy what he thought about thekatz'soperation. i just look at all the benjamin's, he remarked, commenting on the enormous crowd of people dropping for asandwich."
2261,Paul P.,1113,5,9/27/14,"any respectable human being who likes a good delisandwichwill knowkatz'sis one of the best delis in the world. their pastrami,cornedbeef,hotdogs and fries are all delicious. anyone who giveskatz'sa bad review should stop using yelp i'm immediately."

2268,Davis D.,1113,4,4/21/09,"holy cow! after watching travel channel and seeing this as one of the musttry spots in nyc, i had to try it out and drag my friends that live in nyc with me. i had no idea about this place except that it supposedly had the best pastrami ever. we got here and it is pretty large and crowded, and filled with all kinds of stuff on the walls like pictures of celebrities that have eaten there, posters, beer neon lights, etc. they also had bread crumbs everywhere on the floornot sure what the purpose was but i'm sure there is a good one.it did not bother me. anyways, you basically walk up to any one of the chef's behind the counter and there was of them , and you would tell them what you want.i ordered the pastramisandwichof course along with my friends. i just had mustard, and pickles on the side with it. the chef pulls out a huge slab of smoked meat, and cuts off a couple slices for you to sample first before he puts together yoursandwich. he made oursandwiches, which were filled with at least an inch and a half of pure smoke pastrami. i took my bite, and words cannot describe how amazing it was. the pastrami here is out of this world. sliced nice and thin, with a nice, crisp peppery crust, juicy, moist.all worth it.be prepared to spend some coin here though. you are looking at at least per person. mysandwichwas alone, and though it looks small, you will be surprised how quickly you feel like you will have a heart attack. none of my friends were able to finish it, including myself. in the end, i paid about for everything because of drinks etc.i highly recommend this spot if you are in nyc.you cannot be disappointed, and i wish they had a spot like this in ca.i thought ca had good pastrami joints, but i was wrong. if pastrami is not your thing, they havecornedbeef,hotdogs, and other types of delisandwiches. a must try."

2272,Sharon M.,1113,4,10/23/18,"yes it was a madhouse. yes there was a wait. yes it was not inexpensive at something per sandwich with only pickle slices as an accompanying side. yes the chocolate egg cream is not cheap either.but are they worth it yes.i had the pastrami sandwich and it was stacked with flavorful and tender meat on rye. my sister had the corned beef & said it was okay. another diner at our table had the corned beef and commented it was dry. thematzoballsoupwas the best i've ever tasted. the 'ball' was flavorful and light in texture.the chocolate egg cream was both rich and refreshing worth every penny.i also had the cheesecake without any fruit topping. i only had a couple of bites as i prefer a sweeter cheesecake but my sister found it to her liking so it is just a matter of personal taste.we opted to sit at a table with a server and were glad we did! while others camped out looking for a place to sit, we were seated after a minute wait and got good service. it was worth paying a % tip to us and you are supporting someone else having a job."

2286,Tiffany J.,1113,5,8/23/18,"worth.please come here.with over reviews and all the fame it needs, there is not much for me to say. the only beef i've had that topped this was texas brisket. enjoy the heap of pastrami between two pieces of rye and nothing else other than cucumbers and pickles . i love the conceptthe entire show is on the pastrami.otherwise, portions are huge, so be mindful. ordering can be confusing, and lines can get long, so ask before you waste too much time.thematzoballsoupis also pretty good. reminds me of the chinese meatballs from my childhood, but much softer. i also got to try chopped liver and kugel for the first time, which was. interesting. but i am certainly not qualified to say much about kugel or chopped liver."

2289,Mike B.,1113,1,10/31/18,"anyone that rates this place as great has never had good deli. first the acceptable. the pickles & coleslaw were good & it all stops there. the potato salad was awful, it had an aftertaste that has not left hours later. our friend had a mediocre chili dog & fries for , though i will grant that this may not be the place for chili. still very expensive. wife had half pastrami & split pea soup. she said the soup was good & got sick from the pastrami.i hadcornedbeefsandwich. the rye bread was the worst. no crust & spongy like brown wonder bread. thecornedbeefwas barely adequate.all of this for . + tip. it would be ok to charge absurdly if it was any good. it is not, do not go!"
2290,Chris L.,1113,3,9/11/18,"came here with a friend to see what the fuss was all about. we split acornedbeefsandwichand a pastramisandwich. the meat in thesesandwicheswere absolutely top notch, but the bread was a serious turn off for me. really was not a fan of the texture or the flavor of the bread.also, there was way too much meat, nobody needs that much meat on asandwich. but i guess they really need to stuff thosesandwichesto justify the price tag.to sum up amazing meat butsandwichesare way overpriced. next time i come i will be ordering the meat a la carte."
2291,Alex P.,1113,4,9/3/18,"had thecornedbeefsandwich. it was pretty good, just a little dry compared to othercornedbeefi've had.was not prepared for the prices. wanted to try the brisket but a sandwichwith no sides is pretty expensive, so me and my bf just split. thesandwichesare big, i do not think i would be able to eat one by itself. you can get a halfsandwichwith a side soup or salad , but its about the same price as a wholesandwich, so not really a good value in my opinion.environment was pretty cool, but definitely an odd system for ordering. do not lose your ticket. i think next time i would do waiter service just to avoid the cramped order line.overall, i definitely thinks it is worth trying but just know what to expect."
2292,Chris K.,1113,1,9/3/18,"do not eat here! tourist trap and staff has dmv trained attitudes. high volume crowd system is extremely confusing. first you are given ticket and not told why. do not lose your ticket if you have a party member who is not dining and lose ticket a bouncer will block the door and not let you leave until you pay .next you have a long counter top with signs that say cutter , cutter etc but the staff does not tell you that you can go to any of these lines so everyone lines up at cutter # .next a staff member, dmv style, says what do you want then when you tell them your order they start talking to other staff members and do not acknowledge you. so i waited ten minutes for the staff to make my order. the staff slops the order on a plate and then calls for next patron why you wonder where to go next.i then went to look for beverage and wanted to pay.the beverage person then told me that i was in the wrong spot and pointed south. so i went south and that person sent me back full circle. i received beverage after complaining and then attempted to pay for my order. no waiter said you pay when you leave.next you look for competitive seating. picture trying to get michael jackson back stage tickets! oh i see a table but it has a sign that says waiter service table. so i did not understand since i had to get my own food, my own drink and my own napkins why would i need a waiter foodcornedbeefsandwich.meat was very tender and bucks or perfect for construction workers. meat tastes like it was boiled and then someone accidentally dumped a salt shaker on meat.then we left to pay for the wonderful meal and see the beginning of my post!"
2293,Jane Y.,1113,4,7/29/18,"katz's delicatessen is a nyc icon for a reason, and i finally got to experience why firsthand. the housemadecornedbeefis good and the pastrami. omg that pastrami is freaking amazing! they sell so much of it so quickly, and they give you so much, that you are guaranteed to get freshly braised meat, and they give you so much of it, that you will quickly understand why it also costs so much for a simple pastrami cornedbeefsandwich. in addition to the meat, the men behind katz's deli counter have their customer experience down to a science . they provide you with a sample of the meat your purchasing. . if you are getting your purchase to go, you can request they package everything separately and they will do so without any qualms. meat in one wrapper, bread in another wrapper, pickles in a third wrapper, and all of your accouterments like the mustard are packed in their own containers.if you are in the area, or in nyc for a visit, it is worth putting onto your list of places to visit.there are two things that i do not like about this place though that prevents me from rating katz's delicatessen with a perfect score. they are the following . the line outside with a bouncer at the entrance and as soon as you step inside is well orchestrated and they are clear from the get go that you must retain their ticket or risk financial penalty. however, once you get past the two bouncers, it is kind of fend for yourself. you line up for the deli employee, but people cut, and openly push their way to the front of the line. . they appear as though they are a cash only establishment, but if you actually take a look, you can pay with a credit. the credit card station is at the very left of all of the lined up deli employees behind the counter."
2294,Debi R.,1113,3,7/27/18,"i wanted to love this place. we were a party of and we all ordered something different.of course we ordered the pastrami andcornedbeefsandwiches. we also had cheese steaksandwiches, chickensandwichesand more. most of the meat was on the dry side. our overall rating of the food was average.the way you order is a bit confusing. upon entry you get a ticket. when you order your food, you give the server your ticket and they write the price it and return it to you. the same goes for ordering sides and drinks. you pay as you exit. if you lose your ticket, you pay .which would have been perfect if we lost ours, cuz after sandwiches, sides and many beers they would have lost money!staff was friendly and helpful when asked how to navigate the ordering system.the only time i said, i will have what she is having. is when i was asked if i wanted another beer."
2295,Donathon C.,1113,5,7/10/18,"bestsandwichi ever put in my mouth!the pastrami and reuben cornedbeef sandwicheswere absolutely toecurling orgasmic othis was at the top of my todo list when i came to ny. ive seen a lot of documentaries and read lots of articles about this place and have been really excited to try it. you walk in, grab a ticket, and walk up to the cutting station where a cutter will take your order, take out the fresh cooked meat, have you sample, then cut the meat in front of you. you will then take your food to the left, grab a drink, then sit down at a table. they will mark your ticket as you order things.you pay at the end so keep your ticket!minimum charge if you lose it. you cannot get out without paying and or the ticket.enough hype, let us get to the food.i tried both their pastrami and reuben cornedbeef sandwiches came two days in a row . i know this place is famous for the pastrami but thecornedbeefwas just as good.the pastrami was to die for though! such good flavor and cooked perfectly. the reuben had melted cheese and their special sauce relish spread. totally made thesandwichnext level! i did not have sauerkraut because i'm not a big fan, but theirs was actually really good.here just look at my pictures. it tasted better than i could take a picture of.it is been an hour and my toes are still actively curling oi think i need to go lay on the bed now. enjoy the pictures"

2297,S C.,1113,3,6/24/18,"worse than expected.cornedbeefsandwichwas good, but not great. overall, it was not up to the hype of its name. maybe too touristy now."
2298,Nicole W.,1113,2,6/18/18,"i thought this would have been a good substitute for carnegie deli, but it is not.cornedbeefsandwichwas mediocre."
2299,Tommy O.,1113,5,6/10/18,"ever since i saw katz's on man vs. food, i knew it was destiny for me to come here. pizza,sandwiches, and pasta are my favorite foods and i am a huge fan of pastrami andcornedbeefsandwiches. my buddy and i stood in line around am on a sunday. the line streaked around the corner, but it was not too bad as it moved very quickly. we were inside within about minutes. fair warning, during peak times, the wait time can get in between + hours. but with the ordering system in place, the line does actually move. once we got inside, it was a madhouse as there were a ton of people, but there was also a ton of seating.so i will give you a little scoop of how the ordering system works if you are too lazy to google it. the cashier gives you a ticket. make sure you do not lose this ticket!!! or you will be charged for a lost ticket. you then have three separate areas with lines to order sides soup hot dogs,sandwiches, and beverages. you can step up into any line and then you wait until you can order. then you give them your order and they make your food for you while adding your items to your ticket. when you order yoursandwich, you get to see them cut your meat and they give you samples while you are waiting, which was a very cool experience. once you get your food, you can go eat. the place is packed so be ready to be sitting next to someone in communal cafeteria style seating. once you are done eating, leave the plates on the table as someone comes around to pick them up. then head up to the cashier to go pay. so it is a relatively straightforward process, but because it is so busy, it can be overwhelming.now onto the food. my buddy and i ordered a pastramisandwichand acornedbeefsandwich. both on rye with mustard and we decided to split them. this was hands down the bestsandwichesthat i have ever had!!! the meat was full of flavor, juicy, and tender. the rye bread was soft and warm and the mustard added the right amount of flavor to not be overwhelming. words cannot how delicious thesandwicheswere.i will admit that the prices were pretty expensive. it was about for asandwichand bottled water. however, thesandwicheswere huge as they were at least a pound and i'm sure it is a fairly expensive cut of meat. they are big enough that you can split it between two people. so in my opinion it is worth the price.katz's is an absolute must try when visiting nyc! yes, it is a tourist trap and a bunch of locals come so plan your trip accordingly. thesandwicheswere hands down the best that i have ever had. even if you have to wait a long time, katz's is well worth the wait!"

2306,Roberta M.,1113,4,4/17/18,"i've been eating here for many years but never seen it as crowded as today. it is a tues at in the afternoon. not very comfortable sitting at the table with people standing on top of you and banging into your table. as they walk by they hold their tray loaded with food on it over your head. you just hope it does not fall on you. well, i noticed the prices have gone up again. now, acornedbeefsandwichis . and pastrami is . . wow a bit pricey. a can of soda is . . also had fries. total was . + tax. at least the food was good. cannot getsandwicheslike these anywhere else. i took mysandwichhome and will probably put some of the meat on another slice of bread. that gives me dinner for another night. it is worth it. that is why i keep coming back. love this place."
2307,Patrick G.,1113,4,9/6/18,"i would never been tokatz'sdelicatessen before but we made the trip since we were in nyc.it was worth the trip. i had the corned beef on rye and my wife had thepastramion rye. now the corned beef was very good, but thepastrami. it was a battle worth fighting. we also had pickles and cole slaw, for whatever that is worth, but thatpastramiwas very very good. it might be the best deli meat i've ever had. it reminded me of brisket, probably because it can be made from that cut of meat. makingpastramiis a far more involved process than brisket production.the service was great. i got to watch the chef slice up the meat, a treat for me since i'm terrible with a knife. he handled that meat like he had cut it times, which is probably true. the place was crowded, but i hardly noticed. there seemed to be a party going on. good for them. the cole slaw was cole slaw. it is ok.i do not need to write anything else except have thepastramihotsandwichon rye. you will not be disappointed. if you are, it says more about you than the meat."
2308,Julie C.,1113,3,9/1/18,"been wanting to try this place for awhile now and finally got the chance to do so. it is insanely popular and to be quite honest a little overwhelming if it is your first time. upon entering you get a ticket that you use to pay with at the end so do not lose this ticket!! then you either choose table service or you can go up to the counter to order and then seat yourself. my friend and i chose to order at the counter but we were so confused as to where to go or if there was even a line for counter service. when we finally got it sorted out we ordered thekatz'spastrami to share. this also came with a plate of pickles. happy we decided to share because thesandwichwas huge!! the food was delicious and definitely filling even though we each had half asandwich. there is ample amount of seating so there was no problem finding a seat. when it came to paying it was extremely chaotic because if you wanted to use card you pay in the back. the cashiers in the front only take cash, so just a heads up. paying cash at the front was no problem but then there were people behind us who were also trying to exit while we were trying to pay. why put the cashiers there if it is just going to because a traffic jam !"

2316,M C.,1113,3,7/17/18,"everyone lied! not that great, tbh. living in la everyone tells you ny delis are so much bigger, better, greater. since this sentiment was pervasive, i started thinking it might be true. during my first visit to ny i wanted to try such other worldlypastrami. people said it would ruinpastramiforever. nope.this place was packed on mother's day, go figure. it was also raining. since we did not want to jostle at the counter, we waited for a seat. we waited forever. once seated, we immediately ordered a matzo ball soup, coleslaw, and apastramisandwich. the matzo ball soup was good. the coleslaw had a strange, offputting seasoning. thepastramiwas way too thick, like honey baked ham slices thick. cheese indiscernible. bread not a great canvas. we ordered anotherpastramisandwichto go and the quality of the meat was even worseit had copious amount of disgusting fat, ewww. i went through the entiresandwichpulling off the fat. never again. that is why the meat needs to be thin, so that the fat is edible and tender. cannot believe the prices for fattypastrami, i also did not think thesandwichwas very generous , meatwise, compared to la delis.not a fan and would never wait like that forkatz'spastramiagain."

2320,Joanna C.,1113,5,6/30/18,"wow!!! to be honest, i was a bit indifferent when we arrived atkatz's, perhaps partly due to being traumatized by eating slice delisandwicheswith no sauce or other filling for lunch almost everyday for something like years. but this blew away my nonexistent expectations.katz'spastramisandwich of course we had to try the classic, and it was probably one of the bestsandwichesi've ever had. the meat was so juicy, flavourful, and meltinyourmouth good. the layers ofpastramiwere twice the size of the bread that enclosed it. it comes at a bit of a price tag, over for thesandwich, but they pack it with such a generous portion of mouthwateringpastramithat makes it so worth it.it is quite interesting how ordering and paying works. as we entered, we were each given a ticket, even if not all were ordering something we shared because thesandwichwas so ginormous haha . then, we lined up at a cutter, who took our ordered, and also gave us a little sample of thepastrami! what a nice guy free food is the key to the soul hehe. after receiving our pipinghotsandwich, we claimed any open table, devoured our meal, and only as we exited, we paid. i think it is a pretty ingenious system, since it reduces the bottleneck of payment and front loads the traffic on the food preparation. that is also why everybody gets a ticket, and if you lose the ticket, you are charged a penalty otherwise it could have been that you walked out with a free meal .anyways, thesandwichatkatz'swas amazing and it is definitely somewhere i would come back to for a satisfying boatload ofpastrami!"

2326,Cathy M.,1113,4,9/8/18,"we could not leave ny without trying out a classic deli, and we definitely wanted to try the most famous!location towards the lower east side, this deli is literally on the corner of the main street so it is very easy to spot.line wait there was already a line out the door the moment we arrived. once we entered, we were given tickets to hold onto do not lose it or they will charge you , and shuffled into various lines to order our food.tables you can either put your name down to have them find you a table and be serviced, that would take about minutes or you can do self seating. all of the tables towards the wall are reserved for service, but the ones in the center are all self seating. my friends had me find a table for them, while they ordered my food. i recommend doing that if you are not going alone! tables are extremely cramped, pretty difficult to find, so if you find an open table, keep it.ordering system is so confusing. there were cutters for the meat, so if you want just asandwich, make your way to the furthest line the back, because there should be less people waiting. once you order yoursandwich, they will put the price down on your ticket. there is also a separate line for the drinks, if you want to try their cream sodas. you pay at the kiosk before you leave the restaurant!menu katz's is known for their pastrami, so that is at the top of their list. if you are not a pastrami person, there are other options like tritip orroastbeef. you can order the wholesandwich, which is about persandwich, or you can do a combo of halfsandwichand a side for about ! most of thesandwichesare pricey, but they will definitely make two complete meals.here's what i ordered halfroastbeefsandwich . i was so excited to try the coldroastbeef, but was disappointed by the lack of flavor. the quality was outstanding, perfect medium rare, tender and juicy, but it just needed some sauce or mayo. my friends tried to put mustard in it for me, but i did not enjoy it much. i regret not getting the pastrami instead.small side salad it was in a plastic box, i do not know how long it was kept out. the lettuce was a bit wilted, i was not too happy. i should have gotten their soup instead.pastramisandwich so this was my friend's, he had me try part of his since i was not too pleased with myroastbeef. this was absolute perfection, nothing like any pastrami i've had back here. the meat was so tender, it reminded me almost of brisket. it was smoking and piping hot when my friend unwrapped his. definitely worth ! it was so much that he took the rest to the airport with us.conclusion definitely order the pastramisandwich, nothing else! do not make the mistake i made! the ordering system was a bit confusing, but i guess it is the only way to cater to large masses of customers. my friends told me the cutters were not too nice towards them, since my friends were confused, however, they let it go. i thought they had quite an honor system going on, since you basically pay at the kiosk before you leave the restaurant, anyone could easily walk out without paying. i think they should come up with a better system, but it might be hard since they are so busy and popular!"
2327,Megan N.,1113,5,7/27/18,"this deli is so good, try theroastbeefsandwich, french fries and latkes. the lines are long, but the staff are organized about it and get you in fast to enjoy their yummy food."

2329,Sabin J.,1113,5,5/28/18,excellent choice. worth the wait. got theroastbeefsandwich. go there hungry. do not go there knowing you are going to pack your meal to go.
2330,The T.,1113,3,4/10/18,"i got to tell you, i was a little disappointed from what i was told. the pastrami was amazing, i will give this place that but be ready for very thick cut. since pastrami is fatty, when you bite into thick but pastrami, expect it to be tougher to chew.roastbeefsandwichwas not good at all. it was very tough to chew. fries were incredible.this place is a madhouse, which is understandable since it is famous and very busy. however the way their lines are set up once you get into this place is pretty bad. it is like a cattle call and your battling to get to a guy to make yoursandwich. thesandwichesare or more and not worth it. i will not come back."
2331,Bree R.,1113,3,8/22/17,"for oldtimers who can appreciate a classicroastbeefsandwich, i totally get the appeal! but me personally, i found theroastbeefto be extremely dry and overly salted to the point where i needed to sip water with every bite! thesandwichis truly beastly and a quarter in, i got a stomach ache. it is all about the hype. this place has been around forever, and everyone who is anyone has their signed portrait hanging on the wall, so katz lucked out and somehow became a restaurant icon in nyc and a mustdo for tourists. the restaurant has an oldschool diner feel, the food is incredibly overpriced, french fries are cheap and flavorless and security at the entrance is stressful. it is definitely not my thing, but i guess you should try it if you have not before! it is just my one opinion!"
2332,Mickey W.,1113,5,10/17/16,"this is a legendary deli that has legendarysandwiches. once you bight thesandwichyou will love it. i am a huge fan of both cornedbeefandroastbeefsandwiches. absolutely outstanding. highest quality meat and made with such care you can taste it.this place is a must go to place. with its similar and rival deli carnegie closing you just cannot take these old new york staples for granted any more. so come, patronize, keep them around so the legend can continue into the future!"
2333,Letty C.,1113,3,9/16/16,"i was born and raised here in nyc, this was my father and i go to spot in the seventies when i was a child. this side of town, les or lowe east side was suspect and gritty like much of old new york city. i would sit at the counter and stare at the pics on the wall of hollywood patrons of this iconic establish like sammy davis jr., frank sinatra, and barbra streisand. i would order pastrami and dad would order the lentil or split pea soup. the workers were friendly and they talked about george steinbrenner and our home team the new york yankees with dad.that was then.the sit in counter has been replaced by an assembly line ofsandwichcutters who cut over pricedsandwiches. i paid . for aroastbeefsandwichwith tomatoes and pickles.no sides or drink. . .seriously.when you enter you move thru a turn style, you are given an orange ticket.you give that ticket to the man at the deli counter he writes on the ticket what you ordered.you sit and eat, soak up the atmosphere.and then you use that ticket to pay the cashier.complex right the cashier takes your orange ticket and attach your paid recept which you must show the big bouncer dude when you exit. seriously.its a tourist spot.gone are the days of a cozy warm meals at the counter. its an assembly line of unfamiliar and over priced vigor.this was so disappointing."
2334,Cee G.,1113,5,4/27/16,"what an experience!! katz is the type of restaurant that every city must have that engages people of all ages. they have so many items on their menu that will sure satisfy most all taste buds!! famous for their pastrami androastbeefsandwiches, their hot dogs burgers and fries, assorted pickle variety, and much more.katz delicatessen contains so much history that people from all over, including royalty, celebrities, politicians and more, have left their prints or memories within the restaurant either as a framed picture, garment piece, wall writing, etc. it is a definite must stop here if you travel to new york city and are in the lower manhattan area. you will not regret it!!if you are lucky you get to meet the owner alan dell and he luvs to take selfies with people!!the food is always satisfying. never a complaint. all smiles in the restaurant. and always packed to capacity!! amazinnnggggg!!!"
2335,Jane B.,1113,5,4/27/16,"katz's deli is a mustvisit for all new york foodies! yes, it is an extremely touristy place to go, but i have no problem with that! the classic neon sign and divey diner decor are very charming. they also have a sign above the table that meg ryan and billy crystal sat at during the infamous scene from when harry met sally. you can stand in line and get your food to go or sit at a table to be waited on. the menu is pretty basic, not too overwhelming sandwiches, soups, sides and a few desserts. all of the food is phenomenal very fresh! it is no wonder why people ship meat from the deli all over the country. the prices are insane, but we expected that going in. in my opinion, the food is totally worth it.thesandwichesare enormous as you can see from the pictures . i was very happy doing the halfsandwichand soup deal for my lunch. i started with a matzo ball soup very good! i chose theroastbeefsandwichwith cheese, coleslaw, lettuce and tomato. it was one of the best delisandwichesi've ever had! unfortunately, my aunt ordered the pastrami, which is their most popularsandwich. that was also amazing!i would recommend avoiding the p.m. p.m. lunch rush. i went with a party of three at a.m. on a weekday and we did not have to wait at all! within the hour, the line was out the door and wrapped around the building."
2336,Adam C.,1113,3,2/29/16,"katz's is so damn busy it is not funny. when i first walked in i thought it was a market. you order your cornbeef pastrami roastbeefsandwichesin any of the line and do not ask for anything else in those lines. i made the mistake of asking for chicken noodle soup it was cold outside and the guy seemed a bit annoyed but he said i gotchu which was nice of him. i ordered a reuben, but subbed the cornbeeffor pastrami. the flavor of the pastrami was just ok, very juicy, but i do not see the hype. it is expensive. i probably will not go again."
2337,Eric F.,1113,1,10/30/15,"i'm from ny and know good deli but this place is not. yes you get a hugeroastbeefsandwichpiled high with meat but the quality is so so. for . yes . i expect better taste not fatty and tasteless.i appreciate the tourists spending their money here but spend it elsewhere. better yet, eat somewhere more reasonable and buy a homeless person a meal with your savings. you will be doing a great service for someone who is hungry."
2338,Fern M.,1113,2,9/8/15,"my husband and i took our company from out of state to katz's delicatessen on houston street.we were handed tickets and told they had to be returned when we left or pay a penalty. we decided to have waiter service. so we sat in the service area. a nice young man came to our table, or so i thought he was nice. can i take your order. no introduction! we needed a few minutes so he came back a whole minutes later. he took our order. i ordered the blintzes, my husband, the halfroastbeefwith pea soup and my company ordered a pastramisandwich, knish and blintzes. while waiting for our food i noticed our waiter kissing a girl and running his bare hands through her hair.his bare hands through her hair. the waiter returned with pea soup and bread with the bare hand he touched the girl's hair with. i questioned him about his bare hand and the use of only one glove. he nastily replied what does that have to do with anything. my husband explained what i saw and asked for another soup and for the waiter to put on another glove. the waiter went to talk to someone at the other end of the deli. he was shaking his head no. i do not know what transpired but he put on two gloves. while waiting for the soup to come out,my husband stepped out briefly. during this time i also notice one ofthe men behindthe counter while makingsandwiches was rubbing his hands all over his face, using hishands to wipe his immune nose. when our waiter returned, the waiter brought over the soup and started to bring out the food and sodas with paper cups, which when wet became soggy and hard to hold.as far as the food is concerned the blintzes were good. my company's pastramisandwichwas good, not great, but good. the knish was well overpriced aseverything else but was good. my husband'sroastbeefsandwichwas very fatty, almost half of it could not even be chewed.during the whole time we we were there the waiter did not come over to us to see how things were or if we needed anything except to bring us the bill which only the total amount was written on one of the blue tickets we received when we first came in. when the waiter wrote the amount on the ticket and handed it back to us he said cash only and to leave my tip on the table . what nerve.the point of this review is not to totally bad mouth katz's as i have not spoken to the owner s yet neither of them could be found. i paid my bill. i did tell the cashier all of the above. she was speechless.as soon as i got home i called katz's. the owner will be in between and tomorrow expect my call.i gave two stars only for the food. at those prices we have been given real glasses to drink from instead of flimsy coffee cups to drink soda from."
2339,Brad D.,1113,2,9/2/15,"we came here for a late lunch during our first visit to nyc because i've heard lots of great things about the famous katz deli. we ordered the pastrami & cornedbeefsandwiches, matzo ball soup, and aroastbeefsandwich.the soup was good. thesandwichesare large, with lots of meat, but the flavor of the house cured meats were lacking. and these are priceysandwichesat around ea. the meat is hand carved, so the slices are thick, which means that the chewy fat pieces are thick too too thick. i think thesandwicheswould be better if thinly sliced.all and all, it was ok, but i've had better delisandwichesin l.a.it was a shame to pay so much for just an ok delisandwich."
2340,Vika C.,1113,3,5/12/15,"today me and my husband finally decided to check this place because of a lot of people talking about this diner and how greatsandwichesthey have.but i was totally disappointed, i cannot tell that it is totally bad, but i thought that this place will be the best.that is why i give only stars. we had pastramisandwichandroastbeefsandwich, the bread tasted like from deli and meet nothing special."
2341,Kinjal N.,1113,4,8/24/14,"they give you a number when you walk in and you order based on that number.do not lose the number of they will charge you!i came in with a friend who wanted to eat theirroastbeefsandwichand she did so one mind blowing bite at a time.the place was packed and has the when harry met sally quotes all around the place.that and the meat shop atmosphere with a restaurant on the side gives it a very different character than anything i've ever seen. oh, and be prepared to wait. there is pretty much always a wait."
2342,Rebecca W.,1113,1,7/13/14,"worst service i've ever experienced, and food is mediocre at best.the deli operates on a ticket system where they expect you to return the ticket upon exit. not knowing this policy, i lost my ticket since i was accompanying friends and did not buy anything. while trying to leave, i was informed that i needed to produce the ticket or pay a fine.even after i recovered my ticket and tried to leave again, the staff accused me of fraud and did not believe that i had not eaten anything. i am a lb girl, i do not eat after midnight, i have a stable job, i literally have no motivation for lying to this man. yet, while i am calmly speaking to him, he is yelling at me and telling me that i am belligerent when he is the one raising his voice and i'm merely trying to understand the situation at hand.i am very disappointed with this establishment because i had heard so many great things about it. however, these reviews were from my drunk wasted friends and we all know that everything tastes better while highly intoxicated. the half brisket roastbeefsandwichi got was fairly average and not memorable enough to face the horrible and traumatizing experience with the staff during my visit.for your own sake and everyone that you know, spare your time and energy and do not go to katz's awful deli where the security guards have major complexes and would rather have a fight than a mature conversation. year old girl who appreciates drunk food and wishes that she had a good time here"
2343,Nicole M.,1113,4,7/1/14,"visiting from san diego with my boyfriend who is a new york native.came to the infamous katz, but like some others. will not return.i'm impressed by their amazingly kind and down to earth staff even through all the hustle and bustle of regulars and tourists.there is always a line, but it moves quite quickly.every adult must receive a ticket at the door which the waiter or deli man will write your prices ticket must be presented upon exiting to pay for meal. unless waited on i believe.my boyfriend and i opted to get in line at the counter and order. our guy was super friendly. cut up samples of the meat from thesandwicheswe ordered to munch on as we wait and watch oursandwichesbe made.we lucked out on getting a table. pretty difficult since no one seats you and tables are trashed as you walk around. but the bussers come around frequently to clear out tables.as for sides. we had coleslaw which was amaaaaazing and mac salad which was alright. too wet saucy for my liking.a can of soda is . . which is an obscene price.the price of asandwichranges from .did not realize that until we saw the menu inside.for cans of soda. a reuben and a pastramisandwich. mac salad and cole slaw. our total came out to about bucks.though thesandwicheswere very delicious. the prices are a bit ridiculous. still cannot get over the . for a soda. haha.all in all. i came for the experience as a tourist and the popularity it gained from when harry met sally. i probably would not come back again. maybe only to try theroastbeefsandwich which i heard has great reviews."
2344,Shawn K.,1113,4,6/25/14,a staple of nyc.do not come here often since the portions are pretty large. most people get the pastramisandwichi always opt for theroastbeefsandwich. avoid the weekends you will have to deal with b&t or tourists. midday lunch is always nice.
2345,Playboy B.,1113,5,11/7/18,no place in nyc compares to katz the bestbrisketsandwichon the planet the pastrami amazing corn beef awesome turkey too good steak fries rock the old fashion root beer the hot dogs the knishes the cheeseburgers the philly cheesesteaks the soup the coleslaw the pickles the reuben the egg creams the draft beer the bologna the salami what else can i say katz is out of the world!!
2346,Jon D.,1113,5,10/11/18,"when i walked in and saw that asandwichis almost i almost walked out, but my traveling companion wanted to try it anyway.i tried to order abrisketsandwich. the waitress asked if it was my first time. i said yes and she said we are famous for our pastrami, not for ourbrisket , so i changed. i got thebrisket.a pastramisandwichat home .with tax this onesandwichwas just over .worth.every.penny.i am about to commit dixie blasphemy i am an th generation alabamian.i am a th generation southerner.every ancestor i had who was alive in the civil war fought for the confederacy. every ancestor i had in was already south of the mason dixon line. i have eaten and loved barbecue since before i was weaned. i love all kinds of barbecue tangy, white sauce, rubbed, etc. katz pastrami is better than any barbecue i have ever eaten anywhere at anytime. they won the second civil war for the north.it was asandwichthat was that is . x the cost of a pastramisandwichin a deli here and not only was it worth every penny,i went back.twice.i paid for threesandwiches.worth.every.penny.wish i had one right now."
2347,Tutti S.,1113,3,9/27/18,"first of all there is no parking lot. and yes i know this is nyc. hostess was helpful, with suggesting i use a parking app, since the parking meter was broken.i ordered thebrisketsandwichwith baked beans and fries. they serve an impressive amount good of meat on theirsandwiches, so that is a plus. the meal over all was okay, but not great."
2348,Majes W.,1113,4,9/24/18,"hmm not too sure what all the hype is about. all the hotsandwichesare now. i got the pastrami andbrisketsandwichand katz cheesesteak. both thesandwichesi thought were way too dry and overt expensive for the size. i did enjoy the cheesesteak the most, that was very tasty and juicy.be prepared to wait and do not lose your ticket they give you right when you enter, you will need it to pay and leave!"
2349,Cindy F.,1113,5,8/16/18,"came here on a thursday just after pm. was not too busy yet and there were tons of tables open. you get a ticket when you first walk in and they make sure to tell you to not lose it there is a charge if you do . first station is a grill station where they have burgers, dogs etc. second is thesandwichcounter where you get pastrami, roast beef, turkey,brisketsandwiches. next station is where you order sides and drinks. it can get a bit confusing. there were cutters behind the counter when we got there but when it started to get a bit busier, another cutter opened up further down the line. just get in a line.we got a pastrami on rye with mustard and a roast beef on rye with mayo and a side of fries. bothsandwicheswere fairly pricey + but worth it. the cutter gave us some pastrami and roast beef to try. the pastrami was moist and warm with tons of flavour. the roast beef is served cold and rare and was pretty good with the mayo.sandwichescome with some pickles and pickled cucumbers. they give you roughly oz of meat in a wholesandwichso it is huge! fries were not bad but nothing special either. they do have mustard on the table if you want more which i ended up using with the roast beef as well.by the time we left, the place started to get fairly busy. i'm not a huge pastrami fan but i would definitely eat here again"
2350,Jez M.,1113,4,7/25/18,"quite a long way out, but my son wanted to go, so we trudged there after going on staten island ferry. it was good to see china town and little italy, on the way and some interesting locals around roosevelt park. i would suggest getting the subway there, which we did to get back to time sq.it is an iconic restaurant experience, portions were as expected large, i had the matzo ball soup & halfbrisketsandwich mybrisketwas a bit dry, my son had the ruben which he really liked, my wife had pastrami, she only managed to eat half so had the rest wrapped. was the most expensive meal we ate all trip. but at least we can say we went there."
2351,Tony S.,1113,5,7/19/18,"katz deli is everything you will ever need !! experience the historic ordering process and enjoy all that katz deli has to offer. do not be shy ask the good people behind the counter for reccomendations or advice , i chose the pastrami andbrisketsandwich! a+ for quality and a+ for service. make sure to get the blitzes for dessert you will not be disapointed"
2352,Naeem H.,1113,4,7/11/18,"while the katz's deli unfortunately is not filled with seductive moans like that iconic scene from when harry met sally , it is filled with the sound of postmeal sighs from very full and very satisfied customers.the restaurant is very busy most of the time, which is surprising given the outrageous prices they charge. however, i mostly forget about the cost after getting my hands on one of their famous hotsandwiches.katz's does meatsandwichesbetter than anyone else i've seen, and it is hard to go wrong with the pastrami, corned beef, orbrisketsandwiches. overall, it is expensive, but absolutely delicious and wellworth at least one visit. i guarantee you will not be disappointed."
2353,James B.,1113,5,7/5/18,"how have i not reviewed this amazing place before now!! i love this restaurant!! one of the best in the city if you are into meat!! while i'm trying to cut down my intake of it, i still enjoy a greatbrisketsandwich. you would be hard pressed to find one made better than this place. want to talk about comfort food go here and get asandwich, you might finish half but the other half you will be taking to go. unless of course you are not human then i guess you can eat the whole thing. but an alligator would be full off half of one of these babies. great deli meats, great steak fries, great service. you cannot go wrong here!! it is pricey though."
2354,Syyu C.,1113,4,6/29/18,"pastramisandwichis amazing and lives up to the hype. priced at , worth that and more, delicious meat which melts in your mouth. chaotic and always packed on the weekends.this is cafeteriastyle seating offering either table service or self service. if you want self service, pick up a ticket and wait in lines of to order. you then have to find a table there is more seating towards the back restrooms.also tried the beefbrisketsandwichand it was really dry. only recommend the pastrami. onesandwichwas enough to share between two people."
2355,Deanelle A.,1113,5,5/22/18,"whether you are a local or you are taking a trip to the northeast coast like i did, you have to stop by and grab asandwichfrom katz's! first off, the line was out the mf'n door but sooo worth the wait. promise! they got it pretty organized in there and it is pretty simple, follow the signs for ordering. there are different lines to stand in forsandwiches, sides drinks. but the place is booming with people a character!you get to the counter and they automatically offer you a sample of the meat and let me tell you.that meat just melts in your mouth no pun intended . there are huge steamlike containers that hold the meat and the cooks are constantly pulling out massive slabs of meat slicing them, continuously moving. almost like a fluent dance ! we ordered a reuben and thebrisketsandwichwith a side of fries.thesandwichesare huge. i was full off of just half of it! the bread was soft but unable to withstand the stack of meat placed in it. the spread also made it softer and easier for thesandwichto fall apart but who said it was supposed to be eaten like a princess lol this girl sho' did not eat like a princess, more like a savage !as a warning, this was probably the most expensive meal i had while out there! with the twosandwiches, one side of fries and drinks it came out to be approximately . it was definitely an unforgettable experience and one to have on occasion."
2356,Andrew P.,1113,5,4/13/18,"very good pastrami. i would highly recommend sticking to what they are famous for and that is the pastrami. now if you want something with more flavor, get the rueben with pastrami. it was hands down our favoritesandwichand we also tried the turkey and the beefbrisket. the turkey andbrisketsandwicheswere very basic, so the pastrami was definitely what everyone liked the most."
2357,Chi N.,1113,5,3/29/18,this place is on steroids as in the size of thesesandwichesand the amount of patrons that go here. we waited in line for mins and we get to try different meats and finally decided on pastrami andbrisketsandwichesand also had the soup. worth the wait!!! yummm

2359,Lorin B.,1113,5,1/19/18,"one of my best new york nights was spent at katz's deli. i highly recommend the beefbrisketsandwich. you will get enough meat for two meals. i got mysandwichat pm, got home by , was able to finish half of thesandwichand the other half was breakfast. what a deal! i do not know if a bettersandwichexists. my friend i was with was so impressed by the service she tipped dollars on the spot. if i had the cash on me, i would have tipped . no joke it is that good!"
2360,Stacey T.,1113,4,12/21/17,"a staple for my jewish family, we have been making the pilgrimage here from nj for as long as i can remember, although since i moved to the city about years ago it is been a lot more convenient.we always go the self service route, how it is meant to be. bring some singles to tip thesandwichmakers and they will likely give you some nibbles while you wait. if you have a pickle preference make sure to let them know i'm all about the half sours! our recommendations are the square potato kinish, corn beef you can get it lean if that is your preference , pastrami, and thebrisketsandwich. if you are with a few people, get a side of cole slaw to add to yoursandwiches. do not forget the amazing mustard and in house russian dressing. the french fries are nothing to write home about but my dad still loves them. wash it all down with a doctor brown's soda black cherry or cream are the way to go .keep in mind if you go during prime time dinner it may be a zoo, but i've only encountered this a few times."
2361,Daniel C.,1113,4,12/13/17,"before we came to nyc, everyone said to come to katz's delicatessen and get the pastramisandwich. they also advised to not lose our ticket that we get upon entering. if everyone says to come here, we had to come here. make sure to bring cash because they are cash only. we got to the restaurant around lunch time. they advised us at the entrance, where you get your ticket, that we could wait for a table which will have a server to serve us or we could get our own food from the cutter then find an open table to dine on. there was a wait for a table and the place was not too busy so we took our chances to go cafeteria style.while i was standing in line at the cutter section, someone dining behind us left so mink quickly took the table. score! there are two sections in the restaurant. first section is the meats andsandwiches left and middle of wall . second section is the grilled items and soup far right of wall . i first stood in line for the meats andsandwichesbecause the line was shorter. you will get a sample slice to munch on while waiting for the cutter to prepare your order. i ordered pastramisandwichand brisketsandwich, both with no mustard. it came with two types of pickles. the pastramisandwichis probably one of the best, if not the best, pastramisandwichesi've had in my life.brisketwas very good too but you have to get the pastramisandwich. the pickles were legit! as full as i was at the end of the meal, i ate them all.after ordering in the meat andsandwichsection, i stood in line in the grilled items and soup section. mink wanted a grilled cheesesandwichand i wanted a bowl of their matzo ball soup. the soup broth was very good and the dish complimented the meal perfectly. mink really enjoyed her grilled cheesesandwich. service is very friendly in the entire establishment. there is also free water in the back that is self serve. the restaurant is constantly busy so keep that in mind. you will pay as you leave. if you have never been here before, you have to come here. until next time that i will be in nyc, i'm going to dream about coming back here."
2362,Jennifwr C.,1113,1,9/22/17,"what a let down! multiple people recommended this restaurant to us, so we decided to try it. first of all, their system is horrible. they give you a ticket to get in and then you have to wait in three different lines to get everything you need. the first line is for the matzo ball soup.which is served warm but by the time you get thru the lines and find a table, is no longer warm. the soup was decent but ive had better. i tried the beefbrisketsandwichwhich was flavorless and very fatty. i wanted to send it back but i was honestly afraid to because the staff was less than friendly. to make matters worse, after i went thru the lines, i could not find the ticket they gave me at the front door. i searched everywhere for it while the manager stood there and watched me.i could not find it so she said i had to pay them , which is their policy for a lost ticket. after i pushed back a little and started to sweat from embarrassment, they gave me another ticket and did not charge me. keep in mind, this is all before i even sat down to eat! one last thing, for a halfsandwichand soup it is close to and that is before you add a drink, side and gratuity. if the food was good, i would not mind paying those prices. but, given the poor quality of the food and the poor service, it literally pained me to pay my bill. i do not understand what all the hype is around this place! i will not go back."
2363,Amanda A.,1113,5,8/9/17,"bestbrisketsandwichyou will ever have. oh my god, so juicy, tender and flavorful. they let you try the meat before you order too, so if you are not % sure what you want, ask for a sample. if you get there before noon, you will not have a problem with the line, most likely. we arrived around am, no line at all, got oursandwichright away, and got the table under the she sat here sign, in reference to when harry met sally. word to the wise, do not misplace your ticket. you will have to pay a fee if you lose it, even if you do not order anything. it is cash only, and sandwichwill run you about but it is worth the price and the wait."
2364,Yoomee H.,1114,5,9/19/18,"it was kinda late and my family and i was looking for a place to rest and eat something, somewhere. and i did not know that crystal, my little sister led us to this place called luke's lobster. i was so down to try their famous lobster rolls, so we decided to eat here!crystal ordered lobster rolls, shrimp rolls, poppy slaw, and a side of salad. i had the lobster roll and it tasted really good!!! the girl who took my little sister's order gave her some clam chowder to try, i guess. that was real nice of her. her and another guy who worked there was also friendly! i love it when the workers are pleasant!if i ever visit new york, again. i will gladly drop by for lunch or dinner or just a small small snack."
2365,Alina P.,1114,4,10/4/18,the best clam chowder ever!!!the place is packeddo not forget to stop by for happy hour!
2366,Calvin S.,1114,4,9/26/18,"believe it or not, the first place i tried luke's lobster was in japan. i loved it so much that i had to try this place in the birthplace of luke's lobster next time i was in nyc.which was just recently!it was quiet at am as they just opened, and also the place was cold. it was somewhat of a hot day, but not too overwhelming to the point where the a c needed to be blasted.i had the lobster roll with the clam chowder. the lobster roll was definitely amazing, even better than the one i had in japan. large chunks of lobster and the sauce was great too. the clam chowder was a bit diluted, yet salty at the same time. i would probably pass on this next time, at least for this branch. however, i came for the lobster roll, and the main event easily met my expectations, so it is a star for me.i did not get much in terms of service since you order from the counter and that was it. either way luke's definitely is a yes for me for lobster rolls in nyc."
2367,Thadd J.,1114,4,9/23/18,"yet another great yelp find. after checking in at the hotel, i was looking for something to eat. luke's was only a couple of blocks away.i arrived late in the afternoon, so there were only a few people inside. it is a neat and clean place. the staff was friendly and helpful. since it was my first visit, i had a question or two. a somewhat small area with a few small tables along the wall and a couple of seats at the countertop looking outside the front of the place.you place your order towards the back from a small and easy to read menu. i had a cup of clam chowder and luke's trio. the trio allowed me to taste a slightly smaller version of each roll. the menu has only three types of rolls maine lobster, jonah crab, and north atlantic shrimp.all the rolls were delicious. they are not drenched in mayo and veggies. according to luke's menu, they rolls are a quarter pound of seafood, melted lemon butter, mayo very little, i barely tasted it or saw it , and their secret seasoning.the lobster was my favorite, it was pure lobster with just enough seasoning to help bring out the freshness of the lobster. the crab was light and sweet. the shrimp could have used a little more lemon to help cut the freshness of the shrimp. the atlantic shrimp are not as sweet and the fresh gulf shrimp that i'm used to in texas.the clam chowder was gratifying, it definitely holds its own against the other clam chowders i've had on the east coast.looking forward to going back the next time i'm in nyc."
2368,Meg S.,1114,5,10/19/18,"a friend in louisville had written about this place on facebook awhile back so i took note and decided i had to go. there are several around and we went to the one on william st. it is a small friendly place. we looked at menu on the wall and i saw friend's recommendation. i asked the guy at the counter and he showed me a pick of luke's trio lobster roll, shrimp roll, and crab roll. my husband had the same. friends had the trio salad and clam chowder. she liked the salad, but he did not care for the chowder. my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our rolls. it was a costly lunch but probably average for new york. including tip for the of us. would definitely recommend and would return."
2369,Annaleah J.,1114,5,10/24/18,"wish i would have discovered this place earlier during my week in nyc, i would have gone everyday! tried a lobster roll and a side of clam chowder. everything was delicious!! lobster meat was so good, paired with their warm buttery bread.so good! definitely recommend"
2370,Tom F.,1114,5,10/24/18,"the lobster rolls may seem pricy for a chain like this, but they are divine. not too creamy, pretty simple. huge, sweet chunks of lobster exploding out of a buttery bun. yum."
2371,Uyen L.,1114,5,9/3/18,"according to my very limited experience with other lobster rolls, this one was delicious because it was not smothered in mayo and other sauces. it was lightly seasoned so the lobster shined. i cannot wait to go back. sure, it is not cheap for what it is roll is the size of a hot dog bun , but if you get the slaw and chips, it rounds out the meal perfectly. to me, it was worth every penny because it was so fresh and tasty. the staff was very friendly and the place was clean. we went in around pm and it was dead so no problem with seating. the clam chowder is also very good. loved it and cannot wait to come back for more."
2372,Vivian L.,1114,3,8/25/18,"luke is one of fidi's gem, i used to frequent this joint a few years ago more once every other month. this was before the prices increased for their famous lobster rolls. it is a really cool and casual spot you just order and sit at one of the tables.i think their lobster rolls are more fresh than any other places around here but the prices increased over the years and i cannot justify to the price i pay for smaller size of the lobster rolls. i stopped coming here."
2373,Jungwon S.,1114,4,6/9/18,"fooduhhh, i mean it is good. i got a lobster roll and the lobster is amazing. very fresh. i did not expect to have this quality of lobster in nyc. it was also very impressive that without making it just too sweet or salty, it was perfectly seasoned.pricewelp. this is why it is not stars. i thought it was definitely overpriced even considering the fact that it is lobster and it is in nyc. i've had other lobster rolls of similar quality in the city and other places at a much, much lower price. i did not think there was anything too special about this particular roll that would compensate for the price.overalli would not go back for the roll. it is worth a try but not to go for regular basis."
2374,Rhea D.,1114,5,11/5/18,"we had the trio half lobster, half crab and half shrimp roll and a cup of clam chowder.the crab roll is what we liked the best but the rest are quite good as well.it is a bit too small for my liking but it seems like everything in nyc is expensive anyway.nonetheless, it is well worth the price."
2375,Kyle V.,1114,4,6/15/18,"lobster rolls are expensive, and these are lobster rolls in new york city. yes, you are going to pay a pretty penny to enjoy a quick meal. the best part of our meal was the clam chowder, which they brag about not even being theirs.the trio was a great way to try all rolls but you get a tiny portion and they all taste extremely similar. the lobster roll was my favorite of the but it still lacked true fresh flavor.just like anywhere else in the city, it is small cramped but we enjoyed our lunch."
2376,Dennis L.,1114,5,5/21/18,the trio!! for this delicious thing. shrimp. crab. lobster. only half a hot dog each though. but still so good. butter drenched on it. there is siracha sauce and pepper for you to toss on it also for added flavor.this stuff is good. seriously it is good. just expensive. but a wonderful experience.it was really smoky inside though. not sure if the ventilation was working adequately but the delicious food makes up for the smoke.great food. so delicious. fresh.
2377,Johnny S.,1114,4,10/20/18,"i had the large lobster roll, clam chowder and pumpkin beer. all very good. the hospitality was superior, the entire team was on it, knowledge of their menu and really made all the difference in my experience. i lived in san diego for years and travel to san fran., miami, seattle, la, and nyc multiple times a year for work, seafood by far is my thing, i would rank the lobster roll up there with my favorite joints in those cities for that particular dish. i would return no doubt, good seafood!"
2378,Alvin D.,1114,5,10/28/18,great lobster roll! temperature difference on the meat and bun was right on. clean and simple on the flavor. definitely coming back when i hit fidi again.
2379,Darek J.,1114,4,8/16/18,"i've been here a couple times and i love the lobster rolls here. they are much better than the one i had at lobster and burger. the bun was toasted just right and the sauce is fantastic. i would eat here more often if i could afford it!the only reason i give it stars is because the portions are quite small for the price you pay, and a lot of people on here are concerned about portion size.but hey it is lobster what do you expect."
2380,Natalie C.,1114,3,7/22/18,"my friend and i dropped by luke's lobster after touring the statue of liberty, because luke's lobster was one of the higher rated restaurants around the area. we dropped by around pm on a thursday, so there was absolutely no line. the store was small but comfortable. upon entering the restaurant, the smell of butter and seafood filled the air. i had high expectations coming in.as the word lobster was in the name of the restaurant, we both grabbed a lobster roll. within a minute of ordering, the lobster roll was ready to serve. to my surprise, the dish came out way smaller than expected, though there definitely was huge chunks of lobster on it. the piece of carb surrounding the lobster was simply a buttered white toast folded in half to give perspective on how big the roll really is . keep in mind that the price of this was +tax, coming out to be around . . i understand that this is the financial district, and therefore food prices are going to sky rocket, but i honestly do not know if such a small roll is even worth the price since i was still hungry afterwards.on the bright side, the lobster was really sweet and fresh. i think they used just enough seasoning to add flavor to the lobster, while maintaining the lobster's natural flavor.luke's lobster is definitely a good place if you are hungry for a quick bite. just do not count on it for a full meal."
2381,Taylor R.,1114,4,5/18/18,"as someone from the midwest, i do not have the chance to enjoy quality seafood often. this satisfied my lobster cravings!my only complaint is that i wish there had been more. i could easily have had five lobster rolls!also, huge shoutout to the staff. they were very helpful in accommodating me in such a tiny place."
2382,Mich M.,1114,5,4/6/18,"just finished a shrimp roll, lobster tail, and pickle for lunch and i am craving for more. god, the food was so good! the shrimp roll was warm and buttery, definitely try it! the lobster tail was boiled and tasteless, so feel free to add your own condiments for flavor. they have salt, pepper, and sriracha hot sauce.i'm a pickle lover so the free pickle was definitely a bonus."
2383,Tung Y.,1114,4,3/27/18,"at last. before one opens in toronto, i finally have a chance to try this out. ordered a takeout on a late tuesday evening close to closing at p. knowing that the rolls are not huge i ordered a lobster roll and half a crab roll with poppy seed slaw side and a lemon blueberry lemonade.the cashier treated me nicely and did not rush me even though it is about to close. other staff were nice too.by the time i got back to the hotel the rolls were already cold but that does not make it less delicious nor fishy. the chunks of lobster were hugged by the garlic butter infused roll. so good. so was the crab roll. very satisfying.it is expensive given the portion but the quality of the shellfish is there so i still think it is worth it.next time i will eat them at the restaurant and hopefully they will taste even better!"
2384,Daniel A.,1114,2,11/1/18,"this place is overrated no flavor what so over! i've had way betterlobsterrollsfor a better price. it is literally bread andlobster. really add mayo, tarragon, some spices, maybe some bacon to make it taste good. and the clam chowder tasted funny! the prices are also a little to much for a tiny sandwich! never again!"
2385,Ivy C.,1114,5,9/29/18,nice place! super freshlobsterrolland crabrollalso.definitely a must check if you are around
2386,Nancy B.,1114,5,9/26/18,"my friend had read that luke's has the bestlobsterroll in nyc so when we were walking around the financial district we decided to check it out. granted, i'm from minnesota so my experience with freshlobsteris limited, but i have had otherlobsterrolls, including some in boston.i cannot say that luke's is the best in the city, but it is the best one i've ever had & luke's is on the list of places i must go when i'm in new york . better yet, open one at the mall of america it needs a place like luke's! "
2387,Jennie A.,1114,5,9/17/18,amazing!lobsterroll. wish it was a bit bigger. great and expensive snack. cute place would return definitely
2388,Marj B.,1114,4,9/9/18,"friendly staff, prompt service.lobsterrollwas excellentlotsa really freshlobster. clam chowder was tasty, too."
2389,Mike J.,1114,4,9/8/18,thelobsterrollis amazing especially with a great cuban cigar now thelobstertail is on the small side but great food overall
2390,Stanley W.,1114,4,9/5/18,"ordered thelobstertrap and luke's triorolls. the triprollcomes with shrimp, crab, andlobster. all the seafood was fresh, but only thelobsterrollstood out among the pack.for thelobstertrap, thelobsterrollwas the best i've ever had. the lobstertail was fresh, but did not taste like much even with butter. the soup was alright.summary. get thelobsterrollonly stars everything else is just average stars "
2391,Yifan D.,1114,2,9/1/18,"preordered the luke's favorite online and picked up in store, and very disappointed. . they forgot to give me chips. . thelobsterrollwas extremely salty.conclusion too salty, too expensive i got the double sizedlobsterrollin boston at about the same price , and the server is careless."
2392,Stella H.,1114,5,8/31/18,thelobsterrollis awesome! crabrolland shrimprollsare tasty but thelobsterone is my favorite. definitely need to be tried.
2393,Alex D.,1114,4,8/17/18,"lobsterroll i thought the serving size was pretty big. i got it delivered and had to eat it in two sittings. it was mainly claw meat. was pretty good, not overthetop extraordinary or anything. but the serving size was substantial.clam chowderget this. i like this way more than thelobsterroll.salt & vinegar cape cod chips do not get this. way too much vinegar. if you like drinking vinegar straight, you might like this.blueberry sodado not get this. tastes like nothing. it is basically water with a sprinkle of sugar and some bluish color. just get regular water."
2394,Kenny Y.,1114,5,8/6/18,"this location is welldeserving of its high yelp rating. limited seating but if the weather's nice there are plenty of places to sit outside. we went here on a thursday night pm and there was no line and plenty of seats inside the restaurant. the food is as good as it gets we ordered the luke's trio which consists of acrabroll, shrimproll, and lobsterrollserved in half portions. highly, highly recommend because it gives you a little taste of everything on the menu without leaving you too full, all at a reasonable price . the bun is buttery and toasted perfectly crispy brown on the outside, and the seafood itself is sweet and flavorful. they do a really nice job of not overseasoning the seafood and they let natural flavors really shine through. in my opinion, one of the best spots to go to in the financial district."
2395,E K.,1114,5,7/20/18,hands down the best lobsterrolli have ever had! i have had what i consider amazing lobsterrollsat chelsea market lobster place and in connecticut particularly new london but i really think luke's takes the cake for lobsterroll! incidentallybut i also think indicative of their philosophy and excellent service and foodi stumbled on them on a recent trip to philadelphia and branched out tocrabrollspecial of the day at the suggestion of the server and it was amazing as well. even if there is a line it moves fast thanks to friendly and efficient staff
2396,Antonio S.,1114,2,7/13/18,"portions are tiny, waiting time is crazy long. i went in today and ordered acrabrolla small corn chowder and a glass of beer. it came to a total of . therollwas tiny and did not have much flavor. there was a fair amount ofcrabmeat but it really was not seasoned. the corn chowder was tasty but again the portion was tiny for . the beer was ok. i do not know if i will go back, not sure it is worth the price or massive waste of time."
2397,Rachel L.,1114,4,7/3/18,the lobsterrollis a bit small for its price. myrollcame with the claw part so it was not that meaty.i actually like thecrabrollbetter. there was a lot ofcrabmeat and the price was not too bad. i also had their clam chowder which was pretty good.i will come again if i am craving seafood.
2398,LaToya K.,1114,4,5/25/18,"i. love.their. lobster.rolls. luke's is my goto for lobsterrolls. not necessarily this location, but any of their locations. i came to the william street location for lunch during the week to get my fix. the place is small, but there was no wait for a table. this time i ordered the trio, a small lobsterroll, a smallcrabroll, and a small shrimproll. they are not super filling, but they are super tasty. i also had one of their blueberry lemonades. i think my favorite thing about the lobsterrollshere is that they are not heavy on the mayo. in fact i'm not sure there is any mayo at all, but there is that delicious butter. makes the lobster just melt in your mouth. writing this review is making me crave one right now."
2399,C K.,1114,4,5/17/18,"the lobsterrollandcrabrollwere delish. shrimp was ok in my book . the staff was friendly and accommodating. however, they did say we could sit at a table in the alley. i'm sure they did not know, but when we tried to sit at the tables in the alley, we were not welcome per the wait staff of the restaurants there . a little obnoxious from the dubliner.there were many empty tables. anyway, therollsare great.get some now!"
2400,Kate Z.,1114,5,5/9/18,one of the best lobsterrollsi've ever had. they do not skimp on the lobster chunks like some other places do. thecrabrollwas really good too. same with the chowders.
2401,Natalia M.,1114,5,4/29/18,"been here or times, the food is so good i've always gotten the same thing. luke's trio which are smaller versions of the lobsterroll, shrimprollandcrabroll everything from the bread to the seafood is delicious. i always pair this with the poppyseed slaw which is also soooo good and i do not like slaw. my husband got luke's favorite which is the lobsterrolland two sides he got chips and slaw . honestly this place is very low key and we always enjoy coming here. i guess it could be said it is on the pricier side luke's trio is , but imo it falls in line with prices for this type of food. staff is friendly and pleasant."
2402,Andrew C.,1114,4,3/13/18,"i love getting food here despite the fact it is a good min walk, plus like today when it was a mix of rain and snow i still came out and walked the trek of horrid hotness and sweating. stars because i nearly broke a tooth in thecrabrollbecause there was a dingdangdoodly she will in myroll, props otherwise"
2403,Mengjia Y.,1114,5,3/8/18,"thecrabrolland the lobsterrollis excellent, especially thecrabroll. the lobsterrollis no as good as burger&lobster."
2404,Chris H.,1114,5,1/23/18,"amazing beyond belief. coming from the south east, i doubted the quality. i was set straight at the first bite! amazing trio with thecrabrollbeing my personal favorite. had the bisque that was off the chart. i would fly back to nyc just to eat here!!!"
2405,Phuong N.,1114,3,1/19/18,"we tried allrollshere lobster tails,crab& shrimprolls. they all tasted good, but the best one to me iscrabrolls. price is quite expensive for very smallrollsize. for + for lobsterroll, i expected the lobster quality to be great androllsize slightly bigger, but it is very small, much smaller than expected. they only makerollswith cold lobster meat, not warm or hot, so it took a bit getting used to. restaurant size is very small, just enough for people max to sit inside."
2406,Catherine K.,1114,5,1/18/18,"luke's lobster is a great spot if you are looking for some fresh seafood. i am a huge lobster crab shrimp person so this place seems like my kind of heaven.when you walk in, the smell is amazing, the decor is so cute and nautical, and you feel like you are at the beach.i tried the lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese for dinner last night and it was amazing. i wish their portion sizes were a bit bigger, especially for the price we are paying i would say it is a bit pricey , but the lobster was fresh and both the mac and cheese and soup were just divine.i definitely will return to try theircraband lobster grilled cheeses, their lobsterrolls, andcrabrollsone of these days!"
2407,Eugene D.,1114,4,1/15/18,"pretty good food. thecrabrolltasted fresh. we all ordered bowls and they were really good.pricey in my opinion, but i would each here again"
2408,Grace N.,1114,4,12/13/17,"i read the reviews here saying that the sandwiches are too small for how much they cost but i did not take them too seriously my fault ! how small can they really be it costs dollars for a sandwich!when we got our order lobsterrolls, crabrolland lobster bisque i was amazed. yelpers were right they are very small and not so filling. they were amazingly good though. they are worth trying but if i was a local here i do not know if i would be able to afford such a small sandwich at a high price on a regular basis!"
2409,Amanda L.,1114,5,7/27/18,great food.lobster was fresh. i highly recommend! had the lobster roll andclamchowderand both were amazing!!
2410,Christian R.,1114,5,7/16/18,kind of pricey but pretty great. their special was a lobster roll with cape cod potato chips and a generous helping of cole slaw. the combination was delicious. i also loved theclamchowder.i took a couple of people who had never hadclamchowderand who are really picky eaters. they were hooked.
2411,Archana W.,1114,4,6/10/18,"we had the likes trio and the shrimp on top of the blue salad along with a small serving ofclamchowder oh my god, where do i start ! the lobster was by far the best of the trio but all of it was amazing. theclamchowderwas delicious!! i was actually sad we did not get a bigger size. definitely understand the hype of this place because it was all so yummy. it is a little pricey, for everything including chips was about . but i think worth it. on a cold rainy day, thatclamchowderhits the spot, i will definitely go back to get thechowder!!"
2412,Elvira K.,1114,4,5/22/18,very small portions!! cold seafood put on top of bread. hated the cold shrimp roll. loved the crab and lobster roll. bestclamchowder!!!!! yet the portion sizes are very small.
2413,Vivian L.,1114,2,3/11/18,"while visiting ny from los angeles san diego ca , my friend and i decided to try this place based on the great reviews. i saw quite a few that were hesitant about the price but frankly, for a lobster roll is pretty typical so, undaunted by the pricing, we went in with high expectations and boy were we sadly disappointed. it was the tiniest and blandest lobster roll i have ever had. the description told of the lobster being flavored lemon butter and their secret seasoning , but i did not taste any lemon, butter, or seasoning. i could not even taste any of the natural sweetness lobster meat usually has. and i'm not sure if this is typical of east coast lobster rolls but instead of the thick, buttery, toasty bread i'm used to, it just seemed like a regular slice of bread that was slightly toasted and used to wrap the lobster. i also got theclamchowder, which was flavored nicely, but theclambits had the texture of having been frozen and thawed too many times. would not recommend this place nor would i want to come back for more."
2414,Cristhian C.,1114,5,2/21/18,"came to luke's for a quick bite to eat before heading to see a movie. service was quick and the cashier was very helpful and courteous. not to mention the food was really delicious, especially theclamchowder. will definitely be coming back if i'm ever in the area"
2415,Katharine W.,1114,5,4/27/18,greatlobsterrolls andlobsterbisque! the flavor of thelobsteris scrumptious and paired with a buttery not too thick roll makes eating this roll an amazing experience! will definitely visit this place again when in the financial district!

2417,Michael J.,1114,5,3/25/18,"visiting from ca just got off the very chilly liberty ellis island boat and needed a good seafood warmup! had thelobsterroll, mac & cheese andlobsterbisque. omg!! everything was amazing!!!"
2418,Emily C.,1114,5,2/16/18,"update my mistake was not going for thelobsterroll. thelobsterroll was amazing and perfectly seasoned. i'm a bigbisquefan and that is the reason why i went for thebisque. the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. legen wait for it dary.i had thelobsterbisque, and i've had better. i also order the alobstertail, and it was bland. there was no flavor, and after eating thelobsterbisque, it did not settle well. i'm drinking ginger ale hoping it helps my stomach. the service there was great, the people working there were friendly."
2419,Christin W.,1114,5,1/31/18,"food is awesome. anthony and lisa were lovely. will definitely be going back or visiting another location soon. luke's trio was awesome partial to thelobsterroll, though the crab took a close second and thelobsterbisquewas perfect. good recommendations by the staff."

2421,David F.,1114,5,12/9/17,"wow. really, wow.i do not have a lot of experience withlobsterrolls, but given my experience at luke's i'm going to dive in to this world.i did not expect thelobsterto be cold in the roll but after a few bites it was clear that this is the way god intended it. an excellent butter salty seasoning of some kind soaked the thing it was excellent.i had a large bowl oflobsterbisqueas well also excellent with a nice chunk oflobstermeat in the bottom. they apparently buy the soup from some company in maine but i'm pretty sure they put the fresh crab in it.its more of a grab and go place a few places to sit but its not like a date place.excellent"

2427,T K.,1114,5,3/12/17,"we stopped in for a quick lunch on a very cold day walking around the city.we sampled an assortment of tail and kale salad, shrimp roll, andlobsterbisque. all were excellent!the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure our first visit was perfect."
2428,Frank Z.,1114,4,12/29/16,"upon checking in at the andaz wall street, my girlfriend and i decided that luke'slobsterwould be a sufficient choice for our first meal after arriving in nyc. we had previously triedlobsterrolls in toronto as well as seattle however, we were disappointed, and we wanted to give this establishment a chance to prove the magnificence of thelobsterroll. the pictures looked super amazing and it indeed did not disappoint. in fact, we were blown away by the amount oflobsterused and the flavor as well.given our reservation at le bernardin later in the evening, my girlfriend and i decided to share alobsterroll and alobsterbisque. thelobsterroll had a perfectly crispy and seasoned roll, and the lobsterthey use per roll was overflowingly delicious. it was refreshing and perfectly seasoned, and we both enjoyed it very much. thelobsterbisque, on the other hand, left some to be desired, as i believe seattle did a better job in that regard, at pike place chowder. thelobsterbisquehere was a bit on the grainy side, and the flavor was lacking. however, it made up for it by having large chunks oflobsterwithin, which tasted wonderful.the service was fast and helpful, but the environment was slightly cramped. it is a small establishment, but definitely worth a trip if you are in the area! overall, this place had the bestlobsterroll we have had and i look forward to returning even though they raised their prices .ambiance upon entering, the dining room is slightly cramped and had limited seating. however, it is nicely decorated.food thelobsterroll was amazing, but thelobsterbisqueleft more to be desired.service . even though it was not too busy when i went, the staff seemed inattentive and i needed to get their attention after waiting at the register for a couple of minutes.overall . "
2429,Anna S.,1114,3,12/4/16,"restaurant looks like very tacky with selfservice.we gotlobsterbisque, clam showder,lobstertail and crab clams.soup packages were dirty. it was looks like someone took it with hands stained of showder. not very pleasant impression. but both of showder were very tasty and hot.lobstertail and crab clams were too small for portion and very cold. very cold. like from a fridge. and taste was like it was cooked like yesterday.we were very disappointed. because all of these staff cost ."
2430,Kelly N.,1114,4,11/26/16,"really small place with a seating for probably no more than people. orderedlobsterrolls, shrimp roll, crab claws andlobsterbisque.lobsterroll was probably one of the best i have tasted. did not have too much mayo and a good amount oflobster. portions were the same sized as most otherlobsterrolls i had. shrimp roll was not very good. there were not a lot of flavors and shrimps were small. crab claws were small also.lobsterbisquewas just what i needed on a cold day. it was hearty and had good amount of chunky pieces oflobster."
2431,Aliyah E.,1114,3,6/9/16,"my star rating is leaning mainly on the cost of thelobsterroll, cape cod chips, thelobsterbisqueand crackers that was all . oh! and let us not forget the of the pickle! and the fact that the food was not entirely filling yes, gluttony is real! .thelobsterroll was tasty and i love that when i bit into it i could taste solely thelobsterand a hint of butter and seasoning. i have to say that i was sad to see it go once i had the fourth and final bite.luke'slobsteris good if you have either already eaten and or just have a craving for shrimp, crab orlobsterrolls. do not plan on getting filled up onlobster, unless you have deep pockets! this place i highly recommend for appeasing your seafood craving or getting a tasty lunch."
2432,Yasmin R.,1114,5,7/9/15,"i'm an addict i needlobsterroll rehab.it is my vice.they are truly amazing!i visit luke's at least twice a month for theirlobsterrolls and spicy crabbisque also amazing, and only served on every other wednesday , the clam chowder is also very good, and thelobsterbisquetrails in third place for me.the shrimp and crab rolls, i personally, can go without. if you order the meal, it comes with a soda, chips or cole slaw. go with the chips, the slaw has no flavor and just tastes like bland shredded cabbage.if you have an extra to spare on a satisfying, flavorful, seafood lunch snack and i say lunch snack, because it does not fill you up, it just satisfies a craving p"
2433,Tony D.,1114,5,11/30/17,"when it comes to lobster rolls,luke'sare the best. the lobster is fresh and the roll is simple, so the flavor of the lobster really shines through. i've tried the crab and shrimp rolls as well. all are good, but the shrimp was my least favorite. the portions are not that large, so you will need to either order more than roll or something else to go with it. i went with theluke'strio."
2434,Karen K.,1114,1,11/2/17,"a bit disappointed. looks are definitely deceiving. the reviews on here are old & the menu has changed. i had theluke'striowhich includes of all three crab, shrimp, lobster. do not waste your money. they are small & i found the crab meat to be super salty, the lobster roll was tasteless not like your normal lobster roll. before they atriothat included all three with a drink, side of chips and or pickle which costed more but i'm assuming worth it. before . now . honestly the best part or the rolls was the buttery toasted buns. my coworker had a cold drink that is was pretty gross in her words. they do have a lobster mac & cheese that i wanted to try but after today's experience i might just take that thought back!"
2435,Dave T.,1114,5,9/19/17,"got theluke'strioto give each a try. each roll was outstanding, and it was very clear that the hype was well deserved. my favorite of the three was the lobster roll, but i went back and forth before reaching that conclusion. prices are definitely high but worth it."
2436,Ted S.,1114,4,8/6/17,"food is super delicious, portions weak. i had aluke'strioand a beer for . tipped my change, so for i got a delicious meal, but the rolls are basically snack size. i know it is nyc, but i expected not to leave hungry. regardless, food and preparation top notch. honestly i think i like the shrimp the best, crab nd, then lobstah. i would definitely return, but might just go with a shrimp roll for instead of thetriofor . . i got to taste a little of everything, but i think theluke'striomay be the high profit item on the menu. portions the only thing keeping me from leaving stars"
2437,Lillian C.,1114,5,6/13/17,"this was my first time trying the lobster roll and it did not disappoint! there was a good helping of wellseasoned lobster on it and even the bun was flavorful. you can get a card stamped everytime you order a lobster roll,luke'strio, or tail salad. after the th stamp, you get one for free! i would recommend coming here if you are in the financial district and want a quick bite to eat."
2438,Rachel L.,1114,4,1/9/17,"came here for lunch on a rainy weekday and the place was only halffilled. perhaps it was the rain that deterred the crowd, or because we had a late lunch around . pm. the menu is fairly simple there are only three rolls to choose from lobster crab shrimp or you can opt for theluke'striowhere you get each of the lobster, crab and shrimp rolls. you can also add sides to a roll for . we each had a lobster roll and shared the slaw and chips. the first time i triedluke'slobster was at the theater district and i thought it was just ok. i have a better impression of the lobster rolls at this fidi location. the bun was buttered and toasted perfectly, there was a generous amount of fresh lobster and there was just the right amount of seasoning on the lobster. however, i would say skip the combo and just have the lobster roll, then go elsewhere for desserts "
2439,Alexey M.,1114,5,12/21/16,"oh my god, it was sooooooo tasty. we will come back here tomorrow, cos this place is magic! suggesting you to take luke'strio it is a brilliant offer for this price!"
2440,Michael L.,1114,5,11/17/16,"this is a great spot to stop for lunch, especially when you need that lobster roll fix! they have lobster rolls, crab rolls, and shrimp rolls, as well as salads. i have had theluke'sfavorite and theluke'strio.a must when you are anywhere near william street!!"
2441,Xiaoning F.,1114,2,10/2/15,ultra small size. dollars can buy me two greatlobstertailsand a bread and i can make a far more delicious one at home. still hungry after a meal.
2442,Stella S.,1115,5,11/7/18,"no wait on a wednesday night! this was the perfect quick dinner after a broadway show. we were starving after watching the book of mormon and decided to try totto ramen. there was table ahead of us, but the host seated us within mins of getting there. i was surprised the restaurant was so small for a place with so many reviews. it felt authentic. if you sit at the bar, you can see the chefs making the ramen.our host recommended the spicy miso paitan with bamboo shoots. i ordered this and my friend ordered the original paitan with egg.spicy miso paitan the broth was really thick and flavorful which was nice on a cold day. i love the chili sauce they put in this. this really hit the spot. i am giving this stars because the broth was too much at the end so i was not able to finish my ramen. typically, the soup is my favorite part, but it was just too thick for me to finish it.original paitan the broth was nice and rich, and surprisingly not too salty. the green onions tasted super fresh. the broth was such a nice contrast to the spicy miso paitan. we finished pretty much all the broth because it was so tasty!next time i would definitely get these again, but order the spicy miso paitan to share then get the original ramen to share to finish off the meal."
2443,Annie L.,1115,4,11/1/18,"went here around pm and there was a line out the door but the wait was not very long.i ordered the spicy miso paitan with pork and my brother got the spicy paitan with chicken. both were delicious. the broth has a very bold chicken flavor and mine was a little extra oily from the spicy oil which i do like. so if you are not a fan of heavy broths, do not order what we did for it is a very particular flavor.i loved how they cooked their charsui pork. it was tender and juicy, which went perfect with the al dente noodles. perfect fall winter meal."
2444,connie c.,1115,4,10/29/18,spicy paitan with char siu and egg the broth is creamy but not too heavy compared to the tonkatsu . noodle textures are perfect. the only thing i did not love was the char siu. i feel like their original location makes it just a little better.cash only!
2445,Ivy C.,1115,3,10/24/18,"i love the authentic feel of this tiny, bustling ramen shop bar seating next to the open kitchen with rolling vats of ramen broth, fresh noodles, and japanese staff. but despite its popularity and the thousands of star reviews, we were pretty disappointed in the food. i wanted to love it so badly, darn it. it was our last meal in ny.i always hoped this would be better than ippudo or the best we have in ca. so i set up my own ramen taste test to try ippudo, totto the two most reviewed + star ramen restaurants and one . star, lesser known restaurant in this case, zundoya .when ordering ramen for the first time, i always default to the restaurant's top selling dish to use as a benchmark.ippudo had a creamy, flavorful broth with meltinyourmouth pork. their pork buns look more sad now but the pork is still cooked to perfection.zundoya was a very close second. i love the bigger portion, ability to customize level of broth fat and type of noodle curly was great , and how it comes with all toppings for a flat price if you choose their signature ramen.cherry on top, with the wait time, zundoya would easily suffice over ippudo any day. this place deserves more yelp cred!totto sorry but you were so far behind. thinner broth, large, but tough piece of pork, larger, but less flavorful pork bun. shoot less flavorful all around! also cash only.one huge plus though vegetarians and carb cutters will love this place. you can sub cabbage in for noodles for . and the vegetarian broth was surprisingly flavorful and fulfilling packed with mushroom, vegetables, avocado, etc for . i tried that in addition to their signature bowl out of curiosity and i'm glad i did!all in all though, if you are looking for a rich, creamy broth, this is not your place. with new ramen shops popping up everywhere in ny, i would check out a lesser known place with . stars first."
2446,Audrey K.,1115,4,10/15/18,"first off, i'm not usually one to like ramen or initiate a trip to ramen bars parlors. but it seemed like a must eat while visiting. we came across this one walking distance between our place of stay and timesquare .it did not take long for us to get seated at about pm on a weekday. cash only ordered with the waitress up front before being seated. i like how they had chicken broth as their ramen base and chicken meat. we sat up front at the booth, so we were able to watch as the chef made the bowls. it was quicker than i expected! in to eat and out was quick. the quality was really good and the noodles were not thin and soft. they were altendte and chewy. just the way i like it. i even drank the broth and i'm definitely not a soup consumer, but it tasted so good."
2447,Linda W.,1115,4,10/20/18,we were walking around our hotel looking for a place to eat and this was close by.lines were long but ramen was excellent.mega ramen broth was tasty & creamy and there was so much meat!!must have been a little salty though bc i woke up in the middle of the night chugging down water 
2448,Jason C.,1115,5,10/6/18,"the sides shine more than the ramen here! this is one of the few ramen bars in nyc that oozes an authentic japanese basement ramen shop vibe. too bad you have to tip and your do not pay a vending machine.i had the spicy bang bang boiled chicken as a side, i did not have high expectations for it, but it was amazing. it was zesty and the chicken had texture but was not rubbery. the crunchy bean sprouts complemented the chicken well.the chicken paitan based broth did not have a very strong taste to it. there was a lil bit of umami, but not that intense. it was good, but i expected more. there is better chicken paitan broth in nyc. noodles, pork belly and the pulled pork was top notch. the cabbage and garlic were nice touches. overall excellent taste and textures. if you have been here in the past, the mega paitan ramen, the price went up a lil bit and you only get half an egg now.lines can be long, but not as bad as some of the other popular from japan chains in manhattan. they are efficient by taking your orders ahead of time."
2449,Valerie C.,1115,5,10/8/18,"sorry ippudo, i've been converted. totto is my new favorite ramen joint in manhattan.we started with the pork buns. it is was solid, a little heavier in taste because of the mayo but i did not mind.for ramens, i can only speak for one ramen that i tried here, the extra spicy miso paitan ramen. it is freaking amazing!!! the soup base was so flavorful but not overwhelming, and the noodles were perfectly cooked, chewy and al dante. the consistency of the soup was pretty thick and grabbed onto the noodles well. i would say the portion is pretty generous as well. i opted for the chicken char siu to stick with the whole chicken theme. compared to my friend's pork char siu, the chicken char siu was definitely drier, but i thought it was still tender enough. in the future tho, i would want pork char siu instead.great ramen, authentic ramen joint vibe, and cannot wait to go back to have more bowls!!!!"
2450,Sharon L.,1115,4,10/13/18,"this resto is very small. no material what time you go, it is always busy and there is a waiting line.we waited for minutes. the host take your order while you wait out side for a sit to free up. very efficient, so you basically get your food is ready when you get a table.service was great, everyone was friendly. food was amazing! the ramen was perfectly cooked, even the soft boil egg was done perfectly.my chicken ramen was so good. the broth was not too salty, but my chicken was a little dry. my husband took the spicy pork ramen, and it was delicious as well. the spiciness was not too overwhelming, the pork was cook to perfection but the broth was a little bit salty due to the miso broth.the quantity was to the point.it was not too much or too little.we would go back again. it was worth the minutes wait."
2451,Evelyn A.,1115,4,9/17/18,"the staff here is quite pushy, but i do not think they really have a get around. they need to get people in, eating and out as fast as possible. i've never not seen a line here, with good reason.the peppery goodness of their spicy ramen is insanely good, and it is my husband's go to. i prefer a more basic ramen, pork broth, add an egg. i do not know anyone who prefers chicken to pork, but if anywhere would master that broth, too, it is totto."
2452,Karen F.,1115,4,9/17/18,"cash only! remember to bring cash!totto ramen is in a very interesting location, as it is in a basement of a building. the place is tiny with limited seating, but they make it very efficient by asking you to place your order before getting seated. although they close at pm, they stop taking parties after pm so do not try to make it here anytime after.it was nice to be seated at the counter while you salivate away and watch the chef work wonders. every time they make a new bowl, you start to wonder if it is yours.totto ramen's soup is chicken based broth. for my visit, i went with the most popular ramen, the mega paitan. although it was good, i thought it had too much meat that it became distracting. i love protein as much as the next person, but it was too much. for my next visit, i would probably go with the regular spicy paitan with extra noodles.definitely something different to try. i recommend coming in small parties and during off hours."
2453,Claire L.,1115,5,10/24/18,"with nearly , reviews, i'm not sure there is anything i can say about totto ramen that has not already been said. totto ramen proves that sometimes the simplest, most honest ingredients, combined together, can create something incredibly unforgettable.i was in new york for a networking event, and my extended family decided to stay in new york for a night and have dinner together before coming up to new haven to visit me at my college. my mom chose totto ramen she and my dad drove to pick me up from my event at park and east rd. their hotel was close to totto ramen, so my grandparents waited for us at totto. the westward traffic was insane, and it took over minutes for us to drive to totto ramen at th and nd, so they ended up waiting for us for nearly half an hour. nonetheless, the waitstaff treated my elderly grandparents with great respect even though they were taking up bar space on a busy weeknight it was totally my fault new york traffic's fault for being late, sorry to other patrons! without buying anything and made them feel very welcome. it was both of their first times in new york and they were overwhelmed by the crowds and noise, but the waitstaff at totto ramen made them feel at ease. while i'm sure many establishments would have not hesitated to make them stand at the doorway because they were not paying customers at that point, the staff were patient and let them wait for us.now, onto the food i ordered the spicy paitan with pork, and it was outstanding. i asked for extra spice, and the mound of chili they served with my ramen did not disappoint. the broth rich, creamy, clinging onto the noodles so that every bite was savory, completely encapsulated the umami flavor profile. noodles were a bit thicker than normal ramen noodles, which allowed them to have a satisfying mouthfeel.terrific ramen, good vibes, but even better service you will not regret coming to totto ramen."
2454,Khoa N.,1115,5,9/28/18,"definitely one of best bowls of noodles i have ever eaten. i have tried the spicy paitan, extra spicy miso, the spicy bonito, as well as the tsukemen. everything was delicious. flavorful broth, thick savory pieces of cha sui, and perfectly chewy noodles.they do have good days and bad days but overall it is mostly delicious. today was one of the best days. i savored every bite and spoonful of my spicy miso ramen. it was perfection. a solid ."
2455,Sai A.,1115,5,11/8/18,"this place gives a very authentic vibe. people are talking in japanese,aa, the food is made in front of you, and bar seating. it is the perfect palace for ramen,aa and feels like a hidden gem. worth the visit, and will come back when visiting the area."
2456,Shannon Z.,1115,5,9/13/18,"totto ramen is a super small ramen place with no ac when i came but it has got to be one of the most popular ramen places in new york. my friends and i came to totto in need of some delicious ramen and soup and i heard about this place through many youtubers and food bloggers.totto ramen i did not know is actually known for their chicken based ramen which my friends and i were skeptical about and wanted the regular tonkatsu ramen. they have a shop next door which sells that but when we went there, it was already closed. so in the end, we opted to try their chicken based ramen.i ordered their extra spicy paitan with pork char siu. they gave their spice on the side so you can add as much spice as you want to your soup. it definitely gave an extra kick to the ramen but it was definitely not spicy . when i got the ramen, i was really hungry and really excited to try.and i really liked it. the soup was thick so it grabbed on to the noodles really well. it flavored the noodles in every bite so i felt like it was extremely tasty. i'm still dreaming about the taste of the ramen as we speak. this is probably one of the top ramen bowsl i had ever had and it was a chicken flavored broth!definitely a must try place when you are in the area! i'm from la where there is a bunch of really really good and famous ramen places where the price is definitely cheaper than totto. totto, in my opinion, is definitely more pricey than what i'm used to but that is new york for you."
2457,Matthew C.,1115,4,10/19/18," . month october day and time sunday afternoonfood starswe ordered the spicy paitan and the mega paitan. the regularlysized dishes such as the spicy paitan come with char siu only, but the mega comes with pulled char siu and pork belly. these cuts were full of flavor and i highly recommend you order the larger bowl. the char siu was bland. the mega paitan broth was rich and thick, with an undercurrent of garlic. the spicy chicken broth was thinner but just as tasty. the hotness was just right.setting & atmosphere starsthe restaurant is small but cosy half the restaurant sits at person tables, with the remainder at the bar. the cooks prepare the food right in front of the latter group, providing theater to the eating experience.drink n aservice starswe were seated and waited on quickly. we watched the bowls prepared before us and we were served in short order by the cooks directly.value starsthe standard bowls are , typical for the city. the mega paitan costs and easily keeps two people happy. note however, the restaurant requires a minimum of one item per customer.return yesthe broth is great, and that means the ramen is great. guaranteed great ramen is hard to find."
2458,Ally R.,1115,4,9/15/18,"finally went to totto ramen this evening, and yes, it is worth the hype. as others have mentioned, this location specializes in paitan chicken broth which is a creamy with a rich chicken flavor. totto ramen next door has tonkotsu and veggie broth.we arrived at pm and waited minutes to be seated. they have an efficient process where they take your order before you sit down so it is ready when you are seated.note totto ramen is grade pending. we only realized this after waiting minutes. i hope they get an a rating soon.ordered chicken bun . this bun came with two pieces of char siu chicken, iceberg lettuce, mayo and teriyaki. it was pretty good.chicken paitan ramen the broth was killer good. it has chopped pieces of chicken in it. the noodles were prepared al dente and had chopped onions, scallions, and nori on top. you can choose between chat siu chicken or pork.miso paitan ramen this broth was the same as the other but has a dollop of miso paste with ground pork on top. it was served with chopped onions, scallions, bean sprouts and a half hard boiled egg. you can choose between chat siu chicken or pork.if you are in the mood for chicken broth ramen in midtown west and do not mind a wait, head over to totto ramen."
2459,Ran W.,1115,3,10/23/18,my chicken paitan was yummy but my boyfriend got the pork ramen and it was drenched in pepper. we think it was an accident because i had some and there was no taste except for the pepper. cash only.
2460,Chris T.,1115,4,9/10/18,super small venue where you are sharing a table or the bar with strangers who have come in with you. overall the flavors of the broth were good but my bowl in particular was wayyy to peppered. i cannot remember the name but as i was eating the bowl i was literally drinking half a cup of water with every gulp of the soup because of how much black pepper was in the broth was not spicy just super peppery . totto still gets stars because my partners bowl was apparently on point and she would not change a thing about it so maybe i just chose the wrong dish. she had the chef special.the staff was very quick and efficient not exactly super hospitable and the wait even at around pm was not super bad at about mins.
2461,Jenny C.,1115,5,10/19/18,ramen on a chilly day will always be the best. but coming in the summer is good too. they did not have ac so it was kind of warm with mosquitos buzzing about and sucking our blood t_t .but i have and will always love totto's ramen. miso ramen all the way!
2462,Christina W.,1115,4,8/21/18,i came here today with my friends for a quick lunch. it was not packed even though it was a tuesday afternoon. we ordered miso paitan and spicy paitan. the noodles were pretty chewy. my friend also ordered acharsiuporkbunwhich in my opinion was the best. the workers there are very affectionate. they kept coming over asking us if we wanted any drinks from the fridge or for a refill on water.

2464,Kelly S.,1115,5,3/7/18,"this place is amazing! it is fairly small which is nice and it looks like a place you can go all the time however you would have to wait to be seated which i did not mind much. i heard about this place from my friend and she hyped it up so much that i actually had to see it for myself. i definitely lived up to it.the dish i ordered was the spicy paitan andcharsiuporkbun. theporkbunwas so good, i honestly cannot emphasize it enough. the spicy paitan was splendid as well.the staff was also very welcoming and kind. they were checking in how was the food and attentive. while we were waiting, the waitress let us order before hand so by the time we were sitting, we would have our food ready. you would also have to only pay in cash.overall, i loved it and i most definitely come back again."
2465,Megan W.,1115,4,1/11/18,"although the prices seem relatively high ~ for a smaller sized bowl of ramen, the broth is very thick and filling. i ordered the extra spicy paitan withpork, but got the spice on the side. the dish was very fragrant and flavorful, but i would recommend getting the spice on the side because it can be very spicy. next time, i would request a smaller amount of green onions next time, since the amount was overwhelming.thecharsiuporkbunwas extremely juicy and soft, and the flavor was very sweet. i would refrain from this dish if you are not a fan of oily greasy foods. i personally thought that the amount of mayonnaise was slightly overwhelming. at the price of . for and . for , i do not see myself ordering this often.as a small ramen shop, totto ramen is relatively busy, even right before close. however, the workers are very friendly and do their best to accommodate your party in a timely manner. my party of four was given a thirty minute wait time, but we were seated and served within the next fifteen minutes!"

2467,Mary H.,1115,5,1/1/18,"we stood in line for quite a bit for this place but everyone we spoke to in line said it was worth the wait. well, i ditto that. this place is the og, great selection, flavorful broth, delicious food. i've never eaten ramen this good. i highly recommend this place when visiting nyc. the ramen is fresh, large chunks of meat and vegetables, packed with flavor. thecharsiuporkbunis amazing and also a must try! you can share a mega ramen bowl and order a side and it is plenty and satisfying. enjoy!"
2468,Chris M.,1115,5,11/28/17,"this is the way to eat ramen. sure there are a million ramen spots in nyc, but this place truly made me feel like i was in japan. it is a cozy underground hole in the wall with from what i could tell a fully japanese staff. went on a late weekend evening and barely had to wait for seats at the bar. i would not have chosen anywhere else to sit. we got to watch the masters prepare their creations while speaking to one another in japanese. the spicy paitan was wonderful, but i'm tempted to say thecharsiuporkbunwas the star of the meal. the meat was so juicy and thebunso soft. hands down one of my favorite ramen shops in the you.s."
2469,Priscilla R.,1115,1,11/26/17,"s t a y a w a y!!! i'm not sure how this place has stars the music is horrible every other word is an f bomb. i ordered thecharsiuporkbunand it was filled with fat notpork. lastly, the waitress chica came back after we had tip her to say that we needed to leave more. what a joke!!!!!"
2470,Kevin L.,1115,4,10/23/17,"one of the many delicious ramen spots in nyc. both the appetizers and entree i ordered were tasty. the chaisiuporkbunwas juicy and braised very well. for the ramen i ordered, i got the mega paitan, which was a little of everything in my ramen bowl. everything was tasty from the broth to the meats. a little fatty in content, but nothing too much to complain about. the place has a whole in the wall feel, so space is limited and you might have to wait for a table on weekends. but for me it was definitely worth it."
2471,Jacqueline V.,1115,5,9/19/17,"when you think of hole in the wall. it really is hidden but this restaurant is definitely a gem. we came early and put our name of the waiting list. we sat at the bar not an alcoholic bar but it faced the ramen chefs and we watched curiously as they made all of the dishes. our ramen was amazing. spicy paitan with chicken and the miso paitan and also tried thecharsiuporkbun. everything is delicious!!! thebunwas amazing, possibly the best i've ever had. the soups were similar and when delivered there was a glob of spicy paste on top that you have to stir to mix in. we did not add toppings but you have the option to. our service was great. it is cash only. a complaint is that it is sooooo hot. sitting near the food being made was warm enough, but then adding spicy soup & the doors were kept open. it was hot and we were sweating. but it was so worth it. we were adamant about trying the original one and we are so glad we did! we did not have a long wait since we came early and put our name down. limited seating in the restaurant so they will stack you based on how many people are in your party. would not recommend going here in a large group. but highly recommend this restaurant!"
2472,Kevin B.,1115,5,7/16/17,"i do not think i've reviewed totto ramen before. i've been here so many times in the past years. i always stop by whenever i am in new york. the place is always packed every time i go, wait could range from minutes to an hour. but it is always been worth the wait. i just wish they have a shaded waiting area, because it sucked when we were waiting outside and it rained. i always order thecharsiuporkbunand any of their spicy ramen. only thing you are missing to complete the experience is sapporo. try it!"
2473,Lynn W.,1115,3,6/7/17,"service was great. that is also why i think they deserved good rating.we went in a party of . it was weekday at p. wait was minutes for at the bar. the host had said it would be a minutes wait.caution it is cash only.i am critical of good noodle. there are varies types ramen, udon, soba, hand pulled, spaghetti, etc.this ramen tasted fresh but not made at the location. noodle made at location has a more moist texture. i think their focus is broth. miso broth in miso paitan was too thick. their speciality dish mega paitan is too pricy. their chicken paitan broth was regular. their side itemcharsiuporkbunwas a bit salty.environment is not for kids. it is for grown ups that appreciate music of all types including expressive language.bathroom is extremely tiny and the last table sitting so close to the bathroom door made the environment seem unhealthy for dining for those people.i am glad i tried it once. i probably will not really go again because of the crowd and tiny space."
2474,Sarah F.,1115,4,5/23/17,"toto ramen lived up to the hype! i had a minute wait on saturday afternoon and my order was taken while waiting outside. i would highly recommend thecharsiuporkbun. it is sweet,salty, fatty and delicious and by far my favourite think i ate all weekend. i also ordered the mega chicken paitan and it was definitely enough for two people. overall it was delicious, the chicken broth tastes very different from all other ramen experiences i have had but i really liked it. i would say the only downside is that you feel rushed just embrace the speed and size of the place! and keep in mind that it is cash only."
2475,Cathy K.,1115,4,4/27/17,"finally got to try this famous ramen place. we arrived around on a weekday and waited about min.we ordered thecharsiuporkbunand megaporkramen. theporkbunwas unimpressive to me but thecharsiuwas flavorful and tender. the mayo in thebunwas a nice touch.the ramen was delicious and the egg was perfect. the wavy noodles were cooked just right. i did not like how much garlic there was though. there was garlic puree and fried garlic bits. it was too much for me but some people may love that.about halfway through my bowl, the ramen started tasting very heavy and salty. the soup felt almost too thick to drink. the cabbage helped a bit.cash only."
2476,Rucha D.,1115,5,4/14/17,"it is your classic take on authentic japanese ramen in a very small shop, which is on par with walking into a ramen bar in japan. wait staff is incredibly attentive they take your name and order before you are seated during busy times which is quite often, being how tiny this place is . you are greeted when you enter and when you are about to exit.my friend and i shared thecharsiuporkbuns delish and served with heapings of theporkbelly, but i like momofuku's better in composition for ourselves, we ordered spicy paitan broth was flavorful and the vegetables fresh the spicy chili oil topping mixed in well with the flavors already in the paitan for an overall great bowl the special i think their mega paitan come here if you are a true ramen enthusiast and you will not be disappointed!"
2477,K. D.,1115,5,3/21/17," stars for totto ramen. the wait was only minutes for a party of on a friday at pm. we tried the chicken paitan a little bland but still delicious , the miso paitan my favoirte! , and the mega paitan my dining companion's favorite . basically, you could not go wrong.we also had thecharsiuporkbunsand they were delicious. we will be back."
2478,Amy P.,1115,3,3/15/17,"be prepared to wait! i did not think totto ramen would be too crowded since it was a thursday evening but i was wrong. the cold weather definitely brought everyone in! we waited approximately minutes for a table for four the host took our order while we were waiting so the food would arrive quicker.charsiuporkbun for . steamedbunfilled with two slices ofcharsiutopped with lettuce, mayo, and teriyaki sauce. definitely enjoyed thebunin general but there was not enough lettuce and an obscene amount of mayo and teriyaki sauce for a smallbun.spicy paitan choice ofporkor chicken with house made broth filled with sesame oil, bean sprouts, nori, and scallions. honestly, nothing about the bowl wow would me or anyone else in our party. basic ramen you can get anywhere else, just at a steeper price here.not to be confused with totto ramen next door. i was extremely confused initially but the staff member explained their broth wasporkbased while the original totto ramen served chicken based broth.cash only! minimum one order per person."
2479,Kohei I.,1115,5,2/7/17,"totto ramen is the best ramen restaurant in nyc. my favorite is chicken paitan.charsiuporkbunis another must item to try. noted that they do not accept credit card, cash only."
2480,Eva C.,1115,5,1/8/17,"food one word, scrumptious! i ordered the spicy paitan with chicken as well ascharsiuporkbuns. i must say, i was quite impressed! because i sat at the high table, i was able to sneak a peak at the chefs as they quickly worked their magic and prepared the food. the flavor of broths usually make it or break it for me, so i took my first sip of the broth and.i was sold!! it was very flavorful and rich what else can i say but that it was on point especially with its milky texture initially, i thought the chicken appeared a bit dry but turns out that i was wrong. i took my bite and it was actually really delicious and juicy. as for thebuns, it was also tasty! i might have appreciated it a bit more if i did not finish my ramen first because i was a bit too bloated. the meat was geared towards the fatty side, which makes it the more delicious. i also enjoyed how the sauce was not too overwhelming but just right.service i put my name down for a table of two and thought the wait would take at least an hour since the small restaurant was packed with people and the waiting area was all filled. i was wrong. my friend and i came back after half an hour from our apartment and everyone who was waiting was already seated. there was already a whole new pack of customers waiting to be seated. we missed it when the waiter had called us but luckily we were not called too far ahead so they were still willing to seat us when we came back. the wait for our food was honestly nonexistent. it arrived super quick within minutes. the thing is, you must eat quick because the waiters are waiting to take away your finished bowls immediately after you are done in order to seat other customers. i guess this is why the line moves on rather quickly.by the way, cash only!!"
2481,Kim Y.,1115,3,1/2/17,"cash only, decent ramen, averageporkbun, terrible lines and even worst seatingsmy sister is an avid ramen fan and has been on the hunt for the best ramen in new york city. needless to say, she had to come to totto ramen. we waited about one hour to hour for lunch in the rain.tip there is a sign in sheet. put your name down and then resume your place in line. the waitress will come out and call your name when they are ready to take your order. you will have to place your order about to minutes before they seat you. once you were seating, your meal will be brought to you within minutes you sit down.charsiuporkbun they were your averageporkbun. softbun, good braisedporkbelly with teriyaki sauce and mayo. it was nothing noteworthy.mega paitan original wavy noodles with three types ofporkcharsiupork, pulledcharsiupork, andporkbelly chunks. the broth was good, less salty than many other ramen broths i have had. but, it felt very heavy and chunky towards the middle of my meal. my sister who normally drinks the entire bowl could not bare to finish her soup. the raw onions in the ramen were distasteful and quite much. however, i did really enjoyed theporkbelly chunks, which were perfectly braised and packed full of flavor. warning i could not finish my bowl of noodles. i finish all the noodles and left one piece ofcharsiu, some pulledcharsiu, and half the bowl of broth. i had this bowl of noodles for lunch at pm and was still full at pm.service we placed our names ahead of groups, but the waitress mixed up the order and did not seat us until we asked if we would be seated next. when we were able to sit down, we were placed on a small twoseater table we had three people in our party next to another two seater table. my sister was sitting in the aisle to the bathroom and the waitresses and customers repeatedly passed by. the party next to us also finish earlier and we had to get up twice from our seats to let the old party of leave and a new party of enter for their seats. needless to say, we were very uncomfortable in our seats. other than that, they were very friendly, but do not expect any service. you just eat your bowl of noodles and get out!after this experience, i probably would not be returning. i would try the east side location, which tends to have no lines and probably a more comfortable seating."
2482,Jess S.,1115,5,10/28/18,"i had the spicychickenpaitan. mushrooms added. and a sapporo. excellent flavors and portion size. i went solo around p on a sunday and was able to get in immediately at the bar. you write your name and partysize on a list outside the entrance. very tiny, cozy spot. the lines and wait are so long because of this and the popularity i suspect. the hostess and my waitress checked on me for a total of times, the perfect amount in my mind. cash only, great price points. check it out!"
2483,KC W.,1115,4,9/23/18,"important things to note cash only, and this location only serveschickenpaitanramen. for tonkatsu and miso broths, go to totto ramen next door my friends and i did not know this before we arrived, but next door was already closed by the time we realized there was a difference in the menu. thankfully, totto ramen did not disappoint!i had thechickenpaitanwith pork chasiu, while my friends ordered the spicy version. in the past when i've triedchickenramen, i've been unimpressed because it was so creamy and heavy, but totto's was light and flavorful. the noodles were a good chewy consistency and the chasiu was thick and fatty. i wish that the original came with bamboo and an egg because those are some of my ramen essentials, but otherwise it was delicious.my biggest complaint is just that there was no ac in the small cramped restaurant, but if we were hot sitting there, i can only imagine how hot it was in front of the stove. aside from that, totto ramen was delicious and i would definitely come back to satisfy mychickenramen cravings."
2484,Connie T.,1115,4,9/2/18,"cash only!they did not tell us until after we ordered, so i'm not certain if they tell you ahead of time.came here after seeing the puffs at new world stages, so we just ended up wandering over here.they havechickenpaitanwhich is not my preferred type of ramen.they have tonkatsu next door which i would opt to try next time.we ended up choosing this place over the one next door because this one had a line out the door and they did not.this place was good.it was very busy but the service was quick.i love ramen, and if they are doing it right, i do not have much to complain about.the soup is much thicker than tonkatsu, but it was still creamy and the noodles were cooked well.i prefer my noodles yawa and my boyfriend prefers them futsu or kata.i like that here you can specify without seeming like you are dtm.it was a good dinner and i'm not disappointed in coming here, but i think i will try next door next time!"
2485,Shayan S.,1115,2,8/4/18,"would i go here again i would rather try somewhere new.but if you want to check this off your list go to the one on the east side vs. west side if possible. it is bigger, the music is better, you get seated faster, the service was ridiculously quick too. i got thechickenpaitanwithchickenchar siu, and spicy bamboo shoots and the seasoned egg. thechickenchar siu was dry. the broth was nice and light, the texture of the noodles were lovely. the bamboo shoots were not f cking around. they were insanely spicy, so just be prepared for that. the seasoned egg was not the best i've had but it was still pretty good."
2486,Peter T.,1115,5,7/27/18,"i do not really eat ramen that much but my siblings and cousins took me to toto ramen while in vacation at nyc. i would say i was surprised and pleased with the experience. the serving was great. i ordered an extra hard boiled egg and pork chunk to mychickenpaitan. it was worth the price. limited seating inside but makes for a more authentic feel. it gets really steamy when you sit at the bar as they make your noodle in real time. however, i'm willing to forgive that just cuz the food was great. will definitely come back when in the area."
2487,Mei L.,1115,3,7/24/18,"so my boss has been raving about this place as a place i have need to try as i am a big ramen fan, but i am a picky ramen fan. i usually have high expectations, as there are so many ramen places popping up, but i grade the bowl of ramen based on broth, noodles, toppings and service. i got the spicypaitana with pork char shu.broth rich and creamy, had a good amount of flavor for being achickenbased compare to pork based ramen. noodles my ramen came with straight noodles, which i like as much as the curly, but it seems a little over cooked. at ippudo's, you can get it cooked a certain way and i like my noodles a little chewier. toppings it was topped with bran sprouts and green onions sliced the long way. i know that not all ramen places put the same toppings, but for the basic without add ons seems a little lacking. i would have like some bamboo shoots, wood ear mushroom, etc. the add on would have cost much more than the ramen itself . also it did not come with a ramen egg for the spicy one i got.additionally, the pork was a little dry for me and could have braised a little more but that is just me . service we got seated at the bar quickly and the server was super nice. we left a nice tip. i also did get the pork buns and it was braised well, but i do like ippudo's buns more.overall, the experience was good, and this place is a solid place to eat at price is good but when i compare it to other ramen places as a whole, it falls in my expectations a little. maybe if i get thechickenpaitanwithout the spicy as the spicy has more pepper than spicy. i did taste it before mixing and the first sip without the spicy was delicious."
2488,Jennifer Z.,1115,4,7/19/18,"i'm not a huge ramen person but totto ramen definitely hit the spot as a really really good ramen place that i would recommend to anyone who visits new york. my sister and i ordered thechickenpaitanand the megapaitan two of which i would say are must trys at totto. i think those are the two most famous well known ones as well! the seating there is just seating as it goes so do not really expect to be able to sit by yourselves my family ended up sitting at a table with another couple, however it is not bothersome at all. the restaurant is very tiny and very loud but the food makes it worth it. the broth in both of the dishes were very creamy and delicious and the noodles had a perfect elasticity to them. the amount of meat that is given in the megapaitanmakes it completely worth the price. regular ramen in dallas normally only gives you around pieces of char siu, rarely but in the megapaitanthere were almost around pieces of meat!! being someone who is not a big fan of ramen, i was definitely converted after trying totto."
2489,Ariel R.,1115,5,7/17/18,"my coworker and i had the pleasure of enjoying lunch at totto ramen while we were visiting new york city for a trade show. when we arrived, there was a large line outside, but a hostess saw us, asked if there were two of us, and swiftly got us seated.it is small on the inside and has an urban feel, but it is comfortable and homey. the waitresses were friendly and took our orders. my coworker ordered thechickenpaitanand i ordered the spicychickenpaitan. when they put spicy on the menu, they were not kidding. it. was. hot. i had to keep taking a break because i kept coughing and sweating, but man was it good! the flavor of the spices, the broth, the noodles, everything was delicious. prior to eating at totto ramen, i had never had ramen like this before. it is legit!"
2490,Katherine Z.,1115,5,7/11/18,"totto is my favorite ramen place in manhattan. they specialize inchickenbroth ramen paitan , and they do it well. the noodles grab onto the the rich and meaty flavor of broth and theirchicken pork is always so tender and cooked perfectly. i usually add a boiled egg to my order as well, because the runny yolk compliments the ramen nicely.my regular order has become the spicychickenpaitan. if you are not a person who likes spice, i would go for the regular but i think that their spice adds a whole new dimension to the flavor.the actual shop is small and there is always a line, but they have a system of taking orders while you are in line so your food comes out a few short minutes after you are seated. the staff knows how to work efficiently and they will get people in and out of the shop as quickly as possible."
2491,Danae L.,1115,5,7/7/18,"very small restaurant, hence the long wait. i counted, roughly chairs even the restroom is cramped, probably a couple centimeters more spacious than one on an airplane.unfortunately despite the long way, there is no text message system that allows you to put your name down and go around to nearby bars. they also try to take your order before you are seated to help speed the process. i highly recommend coming as early as possible!onto the food! highly recommend thechickenpaitanwith pork. my boyfriend and i ordered the same entr ] c e with either pork orchickento try both. thechickenwas dry, definitely going to the pork.if you are on your looking for nearby ramen restaurants, you will probably find totto and ippuodo westside as they are near each other. the difference totto does not have a text message system, cash only, and no room to hide from the rain. ippuodo has them all.broth and pork, totto is the winner.seasoned boiled egg and noodles, ippuodo wins.cannot go wrong with either of them, enjoy!"
2492,Paul I.,1115,5,6/26/18,"my fiancee and i were visiting new york city hopping around the city enjoying several libations and taking in the town us being california natives . suddenly, hunger struck like a villain of hell's kitchen deliberately trying to ruin our night. we instantly thought of ramen to be our hero. we took to instagram to poll our social audience to see which ramen spot they would recommend. overwhelmingly it was totto.totto luckily was around the corner and this is where our journey actually was just beginning. we started with some pork buns and sake. the sake was the perfect appetite wetter and the pork buns were very enjoyable. then, out of nowhere, we were blessed with a bowl of the megapaitan. it sported perfectly cooked al dente ramen noodles,chickenpaitan, char siu pork, pork belly chunks, and a solft boiled egg.the broth was rich. the meat was tender. the egg was beautiful. great experience! highly recommend. thank you totto, thank you.cheers!"
2493,Hui L.,1115,3,6/7/18,"i did not know i could lovechickenpaitan i consider myself a tonkotsu ramen fan but totto's make have convinced me otherwise.came here for an early dinner as it is going to be my last week working in this area and did not have to wait long for a seat by the kitchen. yeah the stools have no backs and there are also no hooks for bags or anything so i just held my bag. it was cool watching the chefs at work while they put together the ramen bowls and stir the hot giant pots of soup bases. they do add some kind of special sauce or oil from a brown jar before adding in the rest of the components of the dish. maybe it adds flavor i went with the classicchickenpaitanwithchicken instead of pork which i later regretted . they also offered this dish with miso but i wanted to taste thechickensoup on it is own with any influences from other umami flavors. i'm totally fine with few toppings.my bowl came out in about minutes. thechickenhad the consistency of slightly softerchickenbreast meat. definitely should have gotten the pork char siu instead. the noodles were soft. i did not really get or care for the raw onions on top and chopped scallions. the soup is definitely the star of the bowl. i did not knowchickenbroth could taste so good! it is almost almost on par with the richness of tonkotsu broth! towards the bottom of the bowl though, it gets a bit grainy. as in tiny pieces of shreddedchickenhave sunk to the bottom and the last bit of soup you want to drink has the texture of drinking some poorly mixed powdered drink.so verdict tried it. but tonkotsu broth still wins."
2494,Debbie d.,1115,1,5/30/18,"this place, compared to ippudo, is average. the buns ea are good, the ramen is not. ordered theirchickenpaitan , tasted average. the megapaitanat tasted average too. every small addition to the ramen, like half egg and spices are extra . went here a week ago, no a c, crazy hot inside. and they really rush you to get out. do not forget your cash, and tip %, the japanese servers are so onpoint with their math that they confront you on the spot if you are missing a few cents to make the % mark which is not deserved given the sweaty ambience and rushed service ."
2495,Leslie T.,1115,4,5/29/18,"people have been raving about totto ramen forever and it was good, but honestly nothing too special. i realize that most people order thechickenpaitanand i opted for classic tonkotsu. maybe that is why i was only satisfied and not impressed but i was happy about the price, especially it was just as if not slightly less yummy compared to ippudo and other ramen places in the area. definitely better than mentoku where people go if totto's wait is too long haha . after tax and tip it came out to and i left full and satisfied. came at pm on the saturday of memorial day weekend and there was no wait last time i had wanted to go was dinner on the saturday of labor day and the wait was . hours. so got to try your luck "
2496,Katherine Z.,1115,5,5/18/18,"hole in the wall joint with high turnaround. my friend and i came at around pm on a friday and waited about minutes, not bad. they seem to have a good process of circulating customers in and out. got thechickenpaitanwith pork and it was just simply good. no complaints, the broth was good and noodles were perfectly chewy. i tried my friend'schickenand it was a bit too dry. very pleased with my whole experience."
2497,Annette L.,1115,5,5/5/18,"wowww totto ramen really surprised me.btw this is the original and totto ramen next door is the tonkotsu sister restaurant.honestly i was skeptical about eatingchickenramen bc i've only had tonkotsu aka pork being from california & spoiled with menya ultra and orenchi . the sound ofchickenramen sounded. healthy cringe but i was very wrong. it was amazing. a must try when in nyc.food extra spicychickenpaitanwithchicken, option ofchickenmeat or pork ~ a perfect bowl of ramen! the spicy sauce similar to a saute sauce comes on the side. the soup was flavorful with a balance between salty and fatty on the lighter side of fat compared to tonkotsu but will not leave you feeling heavy . the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente ask if you want more cooked . thechickenwas sooooooo good. it was not dry at all but it was not too salty or fatty either. please teach me how to cook mychickenlike this ah.misopaitan comes with half a boiled egg, ground pork, bean sprouts, and a choice of char siu orchicken. was not as huge of a fan of this one because i felt like the miso flavoring was not strong enough for me. but the egg was amazing. i would definitely add this to my ramen.sapporo bottled was hoping for draft ~ service amazing service with smiles everywhere ! wait on wednesday for a table of at pm was minutes.ambiance casual with dim lighting. small place with a ramen bar and about side tables for slightly larger parties not good for tables of + ."
2498,Diana C.,1115,4,4/21/18,"it was raining and exactly pm opening time but already there was a wait with several names on the waiting list. it is recommended to come a bit earlier than pm so you can try to get inside and be the first or so seated since the restaurant is small with just a bar counter and a table that seats and people. the counter is great to sit at and watch them cook as you eat. you can see them torch the pork and create the ramen bowls in front of your eyes.i got thechickenpaitanwith pork and piece cha siu bun to split with my friend. it was delicious, it was filling, and something about sitting at the counter and watching the cooks prepare the ramen elevates the eating experience.cash only."
2499,Joe D.,1115,5,10/13/18,"totto is literally the greatest ramen i have ever had!me and my girlfriend have been there almost times, and every single time, the same order we always get extra spicy paitan with pork and aseasonedboiledegg, an avocado bun and a pork bun are amazing.the broth and whatever base is used has such a great taste. it is almost hard to explain.everything is always cooked perfectly, and the bowls are huge! the pork bun is phenomenal as well. i could eat !we will probably be back again next week."
2500,Dakota B.,1115,5,3/14/18,"we had such a great time here! the waitress outside who took our orders and seated us was very friendly and accommodating.this restaurant did things a little bit different than most others, in that we ordered our food before being seated. i assume they do this because of how small the interior of the store is. but by the time we were seated, we only had to wait minutes before our food was placed before us.i ordered the chicken paitan, and i added theseasonedboiledegg. if you are into spicy food, you could try the spicy paitan, or ask for their spicy sesame oil to add a kick.if you are looking for a place to try ramen in the big apple, this is an awesome place to try!"
2501,Sapan P.,1115,5,1/29/18,"totto ramen is one of my favourite places to get ramen in the city. its central location in the city on nd between th and th, and another one on nd between nd and rd makes it super easy to get to and their consistency in flavour and price is comparable to no other.from the outside, totto ramen seems likes an uncomfortably small fastserve restaurant with bar only seating but they have plenty of seating in the back for groups up to people. there is usually a waiting time but i've never experienced it to be longer than minutes. after eating there, i realize why this is the case. their service is extremely speedy and they have a sufficiently large waiting staff that continually keeps the flow of customers moving in and out of the restaurants for new diners to enjoy.the menu is small and well done and offers a variety of ramen options even to those that prefer milder flavours such as me. i had their chicken paitan original straight noodles in house made chicken paitan soup topped with scallions, onions, nori, and char siu chicken and added a few toppings pulled char siu chicken pcs for ,seasonedboiledegg , bamboo shoots . the chicken was extremely lean which made some of the char siu chicken seem a little dry, but the broth in which is was soaked in completely revived it is flavour and texture. the noodle were cooked to be perfectly al dente and their ratio of noodles to meat to toppings was perfect. you were able to enjoy chicken in each bite and taste the saltiness and spices in the broth.what sets totto ramen apart from other ramen restaurants is the thickness and flavour of their broth along with the freshness of ingredients that they use. they keep their menu simple which allows them to offer a great product consistently at a low price. i will definitely be back and hopefully be a regular for every time i am in midtown looking for great, hot, flavourful ramen!"
2502,Kyu S.,1115,5,3/3/17,"i find it necessary to eat at totto every time i come to manhattan! from its homemade noodles to the savory broth, the bowl is to die for. you get a filling portion of food with your option of adding various toppings. i love the spicy paitan they give you the spicy sauce on the side so you can build your spice level to your desire. it can get super busy so try to go during nonpeak hours if you do not want to wait!tip addseasonedboiledegg, corn, and spicy bamboo shoot for more flavor!"
2503,Lauren T.,1115,5,1/18/16,"absolutely delicious! some of the best ramen i've had, and portions that you can actually finish! definitely get the spicy ramen withseasonedboiledegg."
2504,Judy L.,1115,4,6/9/15,"dined here for a late dinner at around pm on a thursday night. there is a waiting list that you sign up for a table at the door. we were originally waiting for a table of six, but we took the suggestions from other review on totto to split up the group so that we would get seated quicker. we waited about an hour on the busy sidewalk and stairs until the hostess server called for your name to see if your were still around waiting for a table. to save time, they will take your order while you are waiting for a table which i found great as we were starving!atmosphere the space of the establish is really small and is what is expected of new york. i think you could only fit a max of people patrons + work staff in the restaurant. there is bar seating and maybe four square tables along the wall. sitting at the bar is awesome because you get to watch the chefs prep your ramen like we did! the service was okay as we had to ask for water halfway through our meal. we definitely waited longer for a table ~ hour than we actually took to finish+pay for our meal ~ minutes . you do not want to sit too long after you complete your meal as there are still tons of people waiting for tables!food spicy ramen both my brother and friend ordered this and they really liked it. they ordered it with chicken instead of the charsiu pork . spicy nisbo i ordered this and was happy that i did as i did not want anything that was too boring or too much in taste and flavor. i opted to add in aseasonedboiledeggfor an extra . i also ordered my ramen with chicken instead of the charsiu pork . i was pleased to find that the ramen at totto was overly salty as it is in a lot of other ramen places that i've dined at.the three bowls of ramen+additional toppings came down to +tip was pretty good in price and value!overall, a great experience with ramen in nyc. i would definitely love to visit their other locations in the surrounding area!just a tip cash only! good thing there is a bank of america right around the corner!"
2505,Ben L.,1115,4,3/25/15,"hallelujah! praise the lord! oh sweet baby jesus! i finally found a ramen spot i really enjoyed. i am a lover of all things culinarily japanese, but ramen has always been a deep dark hole for me since i have yet to find a respectable ramen joint, till tonight. i know there are like . billion reviews of this place, so my review would just get lost in the mix but i wanted to give my two cents. my party of four arrived at pm and it was only a min wait, the line does seem pretty diesel but it moves pretty fast. the restaurant consists of a long bar where you slurp ramen and only four seater tables and that is it. the restaurant is tight, waits can be long but general food rule, you do not deviate from the original location, there is a long ass wait for a reason. so on my ramen quest, i have been to ippudo, ramen setagaya, momofuku noodle bar, rai rai ken, hinomaru, ajisen ramen and now totto ramen which is the king of ramen for me. also, the bathroom is so small that turning around is damn near impossible and the restaurant is cash only.the food totto spicy ramen chicken broth, original rayu a spicy sesame oil, topped with scallion, bean sprouts, and nori with choice of char siu pork or with char siu chicken. i really loved every element of the ramen except the char siu pork. the broth had such a depth of flavor, the noodles had such a wonderful, chewy texture with a nice mouth feel but the pork was a miss. the pork was so dry and overcooked, i did not like the char siu pork, i think i will try the with char siu chicken on my next visit. the spicy really is not all that spicy, and a must to the ramen is the addition of theseasonedboiledegg. it is a but it is so good. this is the hands down best ramen i have had in ny.yelp.com user_local_phot,a char siu pork bun the pork bun is kinda the big item that most ramen places serve and the one here was a miss for me. the pork bun was ok, but i guess they use the same pork from the ramen since it was dry and overdone, as well. i have a lot of pork bun pet peeves and this place committed a few of them the bun basically was glued to the plate, the pork was not moist, fatty and unctuous as it should have been, mayo is a big no no and my biggest pet peeve is the lettuce addition. i really cannot understand for the life of me why there is lettuce.yelp.com user_local_phot,a "
2506,Sara L.,1115,5,2/14/15,"you cannot go wrong with totto ramen well, at least this one nyc original location . the pork broth ramen is one of the best in the city comparable to ippudo and mu . moreover, where totto really shines is in their vegetarian offering.totto's spicy vegetable ramen is my favorite vegetarian ramen and one of my favorite ramen in general . the broth is rich, the spice adds a delicious kick, and the toppings draw envious glances from your porkrameneating neighbors. totto introduced me to avocado slices in ramen broth ahhh genius. also, this ramen has a generous helping of shittake mushrooms, which i love.in general, i always add theseasonedboiledegg. it is soft and warm and yummy.they have a signup sheet outside the door. while seating is very limited and quoted wait times are very long, the line moves faster than you might expect people ditch . also, the ambiance is conducive to solo dining single person signups tend to move quickest up the wait list. anyway, it is a slurpandleave kind of place, so please save long conversations for a nearby bar, focus on the ramen, and then free up your seats for me! ."
2507,Sarah A.,1115,4,1/13/15,yum! i made sure to keep my expectations in check having really good ramen in the bay area. but i was impressed! i think we were lucky that we came at of the clock at night so we barely had to wait. i also liked that the decor is more urban compared to a fancier ippudo.i had the totto spicy and it was the perfect amount of heat for the freezing night that it was. i added aseasonedboiledeggwhich was nice and soft. friends got the wavy noodles but i liked the homemade straight ones. the chicken broth is rich and creamy and way better than some pork broths i've had before.coming in winter makes the space even tighter with bulky jackets everywhere so be prepared to bump elbows with your friends. and of course if only it was not cash only. i would definitely come back though. 
2508,Ildiko K.,1115,3,1/3/15,"i went here with my boyfriend who is an international student from japan. i am writing this review with his input as he has eaten much more ramen in his life then i have.first off, we got there at pm, when it first opens and already there was a long line. we were told we would have to wait mins for a seat, which turned out to be accurate.after we were sat, we ordered the miso ramen, paitan ramen, and two of the char sui bao. one woman on the end of the bar next to us ordered a little bit before. however, she got her order well before a group of four sitting behind us who came in and ordered mins before. because we were at the bar, we could see the way the orders were coming in and being made as well as the chefs cooking. it seemed that the orders were being filled in a random order rather than a first come first served basis, which we though was weird.our food came and it was fine, but not worth waiting mins for. to quote my boyfriend, his miso ramen was not bad. therefore, we are rating totto stars. i ordered aseasonedboiledeggand so did a girl next to me. hers was fired with a blow torch to become warm and gooey, mine was not. lastly, on a side note. one of the chefs broke a bowl and the pieces spilled into a lot of the toppings boxes. the boxes were replaced as they were contaminated with the pieces of the bowl, which is obviously the right thing to do. however, my boyfriend then heard the owner tell the chef in japanese to put less toppings on the ramen from then on to make up for the cost of the bowl. wtf ! talk about cheap!"
2509,Hannah L.,1115,4,12/31/14,"the food and service is good here. i came the day after christmas, a bit after pm and the line was already really long they opened at pm that day . luckily, we were able to leave our name down and the lady told us an approximate time of when we should come back to be seated. i liked that i did not just have to wait on the long line, but i was able to use that time to go elsewhere and come back to be seated for the food. so, i would highly recommend that when you arrive, you should immediately write your name down and ask them when you should come back!as for the food, i ordered the totto spicy ramen with aseasonedboiledeggand i loved it! the portion was not too big or too small and the broth was on point. the totto spicy ramen was not too salty which i enjoyed. my friends ordered the spicy vegetable ramen and paitan ramen and they enjoyed it, too.aside for the long wait i waited for almost a hour , everything was great! the service was great. the food came fast. although it is small inside and there is a long wait outside, they did not rush you to finish your food so they can seat other people.i would definitely come back in the future."
2510,Debra T.,1115,4,12/28/14,"came here with my sister and cousin for dinner at around pm on a saturday night and there was a huge line out the door. not only was i annoyed with the quoted hour wait, but it was freezing out. to our luck though, a party of was a no show and the hostess brought us in to sit at the bar. we were so ecstatic for so many reasons! warmth, the fact that we only waited minutes in line and there were at least parties ahead of us sorry we are not sorry! , and ramen the moment we have been waiting for. we ordered char siu pork buns to share and i ordered the totto chicken paitan ramen w seasonedboiledegg. omg. it was all absolutely delicious! the broth was so deeply flavored and savory, the noodles were fresh with the perfect texture and the braised pork belly was succulent. overall though, i still love ippudo more probably because of their thicker broth andseasoning. yet, totto is pretty amazing too!"
2511,Dubs V.,1115,4,11/19/14,"this was the best bowl of noodles i've ever had, and i've had many. we ordered extra noodles twice and basically rolled outside, barely able to move. it is not the kind of place to sit down and take your time slurp down your noodles and get moving. but damn, are they good noodles. i recommend adding some spicy sesame oil if you order extra spicy they will give you some on the side and theseasonedboiledegg. yum. extra scallions, too!so why four stars . it takes about min or even longer of standing in a queue to get in. if it were not for that, i would come every week."
2512,Sarah N.,1115,5,11/9/14,"totto ramen is a dinner and show!i absolutely love this place, it is the best ramen place i have tried thus far.the wait i got there at for their dinner service and the wait was already min hr! totto ramen faithfuls are on it. so be early! the inside sits maybe people at a time or less.the food the most popular dishes are the spicy ramen . and the mega ramen . with a choice of either pork or chicken. go with the pork. it is so good. it is soft and moist and . i will just stop there. if you like eating spicy things but not too spicy, do not be afraid to go with the spicy ramen.add ons things like theseasonedboiledegg, avocado, bamboo shoot comes in a bag unfortunately etc etc. all very good.the broth my favorite part of the whole dish. the broth is thicker than most ramen making it feel like a more heartier dish and it is flavored with garlic paste, among other things. giving it that comehither smell and umami taste.also, a shoutout to the very courteous staff. how they keep calm in the mob of people is amazing! will definitely be returning. cash only!"
2513,Honghui Y.,1115,4,10/15/14,"finally got around to writing a review for this place! let me start out by saying that i love ramen, and i'm the type who does not mind waiting an hour in line just for a warm bowl of springy noodles. however, if you are not someone who can handle a + minute wait time, then do not come to totto it is that simple. just know that you will be missing out because the ramen here is fantastic. i always get the spicy ramen, which is a good middle ground if you want your noodles to pack a little heat, but do not think your stomach will be able to withstand the extra spicy, which comes with hot pepper signs. the noodles themselves are great cooked to just the right texture, giving a little resistance when you bite down. the broth is super flavorful, though quite greasy. for me, the char siu pork is the highlight. i do not know how it is cooked here, but the slices of pork have just the right amount of fat rendered and a gorgeous char on the outside. it is sad that you only get two slices per bowl though.extra pork is . for two pieces. i always get my ramen with aseasonedboiledegg. yes, it is extra but whatever, it is delicious.this place does not have a c which can be a pain during the summer. i came here once when it was degrees outside it was probably about degrees hotter in here since the place is tiny, and the hot broth is cooked just a few feet away from the seating area. all the waiters and cooks had sweat streaming down their faces not exactly the most sanitary. also, speaking of cleanliness, i came here another time when there was an extremely funky smell emanating from the back. obviously, this was not the greatest accompaniment to my meal, and it makes me question the way they are handling their food. despite these minor complaints though, i would still recommend totto to any ramen aficionado.by the way, cash only! ugh. "
2514,Sarah K.,1115,5,9/3/14,"the best ramen i have every tasted!! my bf and i waited about an hour to be seated, but it was well worth it! we each ordered the totto spicy ramen with char siu pork andseasonedboiledegg. we also ordered the pork bun on the side which was very tasty! i just wished that there was cold air conditioning because it got very hot and humid inside the restaurant.overall, i definitely recommend this place for ramen! i will be coming back here for sure the next time i visit new york!"
2515,Linda L.,1115,4,8/10/14,"came here a little before pm on a friday in august, and was pleasantly surprised that the wait would only be around min. granted i was only one person, but there was barely anyone waiting outside though the interior was pretty full .i had the totto spicy ramen with theseasonedboiledeggas a topping. the ramen was pretty good, though theeggwas what shined. this was not your ordinaryboiledegg. the yolk was golden perfection, not a hint of green grey at the exterior and was cooked just enough so it would not be runny. theeggseemed to have been marinated in soy sauce, so the exterior was stained light brown. god, i would have ordered three of these babies if i had no self control."
2516,Y C.,1115,3,6/7/14,"ordered spicy ramen with pork, and addedseasonedboiledegg, for a total of before tax. only a couple of slices of pork and noodle portion is small. but the chicken soup is delicious. the nonspicy version would be better as you can drink more soup. taste is , but portion is ."
2517,Jeff J.,1115,4,5/27/14,"lunch for . ambiance a small dingy shack with just seats small tables and the rest bar seating makes it the ultimate authentic ramen experience. the music could be a bit less obnoxious though. service extremely fast and courteous waters are refilled quickly without prompting, and the food comes out blazing fast. unidon a small portion of slightly smoky uni served over rice with some thin cut strips of shiso leaf. each bite more delicious than the next. however, if you are going to serve just a little bit of uni, then i would prefer getting less rice. spicy totto ramen w bamboo shoots, corn,seasonedboiledegg, + each topping, the broth is undeniably fragrant, and the spicy oil drizzled on top makes it extra fiery. totto is not joking around when they put lots of pepper icons next to the menu item. the noodles were also firm the way i like. the corn and bamboo shoots were also welcome additions, but boy oh boy thiseggwas a severe disappointment. my idea of a good ramen always includes a perfectegg, so getting an overdoneeggin my otherwise brilliant masterpiece was a severe issue. value considering totto's popularity, i was surprised the prices were this reasonable. not unlike any other ramen joint. final wordeverything about the ramen is as advertised. yes, it is worth the wait. had the unidon been a bit more otherworldly, i might have been able to overlook theegg, but as it stands, totto falls just short of greatness."
2518,Lee H.,1115,5,11/1/18,"ramen is so popular in nyc but yet it is hard to find one that i really like. over the years i've tried many ramen restaurants and i always go back to totto ramen. their broth is just so flavorful. the noodle's texture is ok. i love thespicypaitan, and i add an egg sometimes. the staff is always so welcoming and friendly. there are hooks under the bar table to hang purses and bags. the wall has hangers for jackets. there is always a wait so get your name on the list as soon as you arrive. remember they only accept cash."
2519,Khoa N.,1115,5,9/28/18,"definitely one of best bowls of noodles i have ever eaten. i have tried thespicypaitan, extraspicymiso, thespicybonito, as well as the tsukemen. everything was delicious. flavorful broth, thick savory pieces of cha sui, and perfectly chewy noodles.they do have good days and bad days but overall it is mostly delicious. today was one of the best days. i savored every bite and spoonful of myspicymiso ramen. it was perfection. a solid ."
2520,Owais K.,1115,1,8/20/18,"the main reason this is a star is because of customer experience. will not repeat or recommend to family and friends.food decent, noodles were soft and the chicken was cooked to the right temperature. broth would need some improvement. but it is not something that i will want to try again.customer service worst, rude waitress. illogical store policy simply trying to loot tourists.pros do not have to wait long for the food to come out.decent food portion.cons cash only businesssmall seating arrangements.stupid store policy. order per customer even if the customer is a year old baby.detail i took a weekend trip to nyc with my wife and year old. around pm we were craving some ramen and i found this place over yelp. looked pretty good with stars and over reviews. the place was very small but all tables and counter tops was taken and the business was running good. had to wait mins before we got a table.we got seated and were handed the menu, when the waitress came over to take the order she said that 'as per store policy i need to order minimum dishes since we are people'. wait a minute are you counting a year old baby as an adult well i ended up wasting around on something which was left untouched while he sat there watching cartoons on the phone. i ordered the megapaitan while my wife ordered spicypaitan and if you are wondering what i got for my son it was an avocado bun . while taking the order the waitress let us know that they do not accept cards its cash only and the bill would be around . let us stop and check the calendar to see which year we are in, last i saw it was . i asked my wife and she said she has around with her i never carry any cash its only my debit card and drivers license .we finished our food and it was time to pay the bill. so i asked my wife to give me the money and to our surprise when she looked inside her purse she only had . i felt bad that i did not have enough money to tip the waitress so i called her over and said that i do have the money to pay the bill but not enough to tip her and if there was any other way to swipe my card. to my shock this was her response you knew how much the bill was before eating . i do not think i have to explain what she meant here."
2521,Christina N.,1115,5,7/20/18,"here's a tip, make sure you get your name down on their list before waiting in line lol. there were people getting behind a line that was just started to stay close to the restaurant since there is no where else to really wait at. me and other friends probably only waited minutes which was not bad at all, heard people have waited hours though. i ordered theirspicypaitan, by far the best ramen that i've ever had. the broth was flavorful and it has a nice kick to it, been to a few ramen places in la originally from the west coast and i've yet to find a place that has a similar taste."
2522,Sheng H.,1115,5,6/22/18,"one of the best ramen. it was so good! i arrived alone on a saturday night to get a bowl since the review was so great. only thing that bothered me was that i did not know we had to sign in. there was not hostess at the front so i did not sign in and waited for someone, i saw a couple walk passed me to the stand in the front with the list and picked up the pen so they can sign in. i signed in after them, grabbed a menu and decided on what i wanted. i got called to be seated early since it was only me.i ordered the extraspicypaitanramen. it was so good! i definitely recommend this to others. it is a must try!"
2523,Wallace L.,1115,4,6/22/18,"this place has one of the best chicken broths! i ordered # spicypaitan and it was just enoughspicythat i could enjoy it without being too overwhelming. the cha siu was heated on the spot and had a solid, roasted yet tender feeling. however, there was a lack of other toppings for the high price i paid. i came party of when the restaurant opened for dinner and it already had a full house the restaurant can only fit approx. people at once. we waited for about min until we were promptly seated. the waitress took our order in line so we had our ramen delivered immediately after seating which is a plus!i cannot give it stars because it was cash only and when we paid with a , they automatically took a % tip without even asking."
2524,LeAnne B.,1115,3,5/28/18,"after eating here i was sadly left wondering why there is a line for this place. i had the nonspicypaitanand it was just too oily for my taste. i tried to finish it but could not. to be honest, the ramen place by my apartment is a lot better than this and has no line. luckily the appetizer here was really good and saved the meal the mayo don pork . it has nice smoky meat and flavorful rice. eating that, i thought the main course was going to be just as good! sadly disappointed. my advice would be to just order appetizers here and skip the ramen completely."
2525,Christopher D.,1115,3,5/7/18,"tried totto ramen for the first time on a saturday night. because we were looking to eat around pm, we opted for this location since it closes at midnight. our group of got there around pm and got our name on a list there was a crowd waiting already. around pm, they stopped taking names.the hostess took our orders before we sat so that the kitchen could get to work preparing. when it came time to sit, the hostess asked if we were okay splitting in a table of two and a table of three, as we would be able to sit much sooner compared to waiting for a table of . we were fine with that and two of us sat at the bar and three at a table.we got an order of the chicken bun and then thespicypaitanramen and added corn and soft boiled eggs. the chicken buns were okay, a little heavy on the mayonnaise. the ramen was flavorful and the noodles were cooked well. but the broth was very very thick, almost gravylike consistency. not sure that was because it was the end of the night or that is the normal broth for them. either way, not my preference.would not say no to going back and trying another location or another time, but would not seek it out with the other options in the neighborhood."
2526,Rebecca Clay E.,1115,5,4/23/18,"i went around pm on a sunday and we immediately got seated. this was the cutest hole in the wall ramen shop, exactly what i was looking for! you walk down some steps and enter this small restaurant but that just added to the adventure. this was my mother's first ever ramen so i wanted it to be as authentic as possible and i was very pleased.we began with the pork buns and they were so tender and fresh. i have not had too many pork buns before and these will definitely be hard to beat. i definitely recommend getting them!then, of course, we all ordered different ramen options. the megapaitan,spicypaitanand misopaitan. all were awesome! but the mega paitain was our favorite. however i do not think you could go wrong with anything that you order here.the atmosphere could not have been beat. the music was upbeat and cool and the staff was incredibly fast. if you are looking for an authentic and fun ramen experience in new york, definitely go here."
2527,Kristelle B.,1115,2,4/17/18,"i've had high expectations coming into totto ramen because they said this is one of the best ramen places in nyc. i ordered thespicypaitanwhich lackedspiciness, much to my dismay. the pork buns are also nothing special. it is not the worst place though for a ramen fix because it is pretty cheap at bowl."
2528,Amy N.,1115,3,4/8/18,"foggy day and i needed my ramen fix and i thought this place would help me satisfy my ramen craving. i went at noon on a weekday and the line was out the door and my friend & i had to wait an hour just to get seated. once we got inside, the tables were small and close together, leaving little room to move around. i ordered the misopaitanwhile she ordered thespicypaitan. i cannot say anything for my friend, but my ramen was flavorless. the noodles were just the way i like them and the egg was nice and runny, but overall it was not as great as it was hyped up to be, so star. i also took off another star because of this one worker who upset us. the bill came up to about . we gave her because of tip and she kept hassling us to give more money. she was basically begging us to give more money even though us youngins do not have the money to be really generous tippers. do not expect me to come again. the bland ramen and the greedy worker left a bad taste in my mouth about this place."
2529,Ryan M.,1115,5,4/4/18,"really good ramen spot in hell's kitchen. they are open til midnight on weeknights not much else is around here and a recent visit at pm found the place just about packed. service is brisk but they turn and burn pretty good here, so you will be steaming your face over a delicious pile of noodles in no time. decor is divey, vibe is lively and the crowd is mixed at that hour anyway. it could be nicer here, but i'm really going for food quality it is a ramen joint so i will not be too harsh given the fair prices and great food.thespicypaitanwas really good but not veryspicy, so if you want it hot do not be shy to drop two sheckles and get it extraspicy. my friend and i had a few apps as well and all were very good. prices are totally reasonable here and i like it enough that i will probably regret trying other ramen in midtown versus just coming back here again. so maybe i will just come back here first and avoid the let down.ps cash only be prepared!"
2530,Rose S.,1115,5,8/8/18,"we came here on a friday night around pm and the wait time was about minutes. the place is tiny but the turnaround is quick. probably because there is no ac and it was cooler outside than in the restaurant. table seating is very limited and then there is the bar.we sat at the bar right in front of the steaming broth. i ordered the spicy miso and my husband ordered themegapaitan. both both ramen were so very good and probably our favorite in nyc. however, next time i may order the miso and spice on the side, because halfway through my ramen, the broth became wayyy to salty. we also ordered the rice with roe and pork bun. both of these were just okay and could have done without.the service was very efficient,the gentleman stirring the broth hr minimum cooking was incredibly nice and worked so hard in the heat.cannot wait to return in the colder months a steaming bowl of ramen!"
2531,Nathaniel P.,1115,5,7/23/18,"had themegapaitanramen and the original. probably best thing i've eaten all year it is february but whatever broth is very thick and there is a depth of flavor i've not had before in ramen. its reminiscent of a chicken noodle soup. i enjoyed the fresh onions and scallions in the soup it helped cut through the rich and salty broth. if you get the original, i encourage you to order an egg it is worth the two bucks. excited to come back and try their other ramen options.service is quick. there are limited seats and lots of people to accommodate so there is a very efficient turn over of customers."
2532,Leo B.,1115,5,7/20/18,"currently my favorite ramen spot in the city. they have three, one onw , one on w and one on e . i go to the one on w since it is close to me and have never been let down. i always get themegapaitan do yourself a favor and get it, you will thank me later! every time i go. the broth is delicious on its own and the serving of meat s that come with it are filling even for a bigger guy like myself. i can eat themegapaitanall day every day if money was not an object. they prepare the noodles fresh and bring it to the table in less than minutes because it is a smaller restaurant. keep in mind it is cash only! enjoy!!"
2533,Jessica P.,1115,4,6/17/18,"i love ramen and luckily they are all over nyc so it is not hard to find. i was excited to try this place after reading the reviews and being recommended by friends.fyi this place only takes cash. the space is small but service is fast so you probably will not be waiting for your table for long. i got themegapaitanramen and we got some bao buns with pork to share. the buns were good i wish there was more slaw or veggies to help cut the fat from the meat, the sauce on it made it feel more heavy. the ramen was a huge portion and loaded with your traditional toppings. it had plenty of char siu which was perfectly cooked. the egg was a perfect soft boil. the noodles were okay, but i wish the broth had a bit more flavor.a bit expensive for ramen, especially since there is so many options."
2534,Isabella O.,1115,4,6/3/18,i get themegapaitan! always a good pick. the ratio of ramen and toppings was a little off. too much topping but is that a bad thing for me i need ramen with every bite. i usually go to the east side location where everything is more balanced i suppose. also i think the west side is more expensive it was . w o tip.
2535,T P.,1115,3,5/30/18,"ordered the miso ramen, rich and not overly salted. the miso is sweet and not as salty i think it would be. ramen has a firm texture. skip the pork bun.tasteless and dry. went during lunch ard noon. waitied for min. good friendly services. saw other people ordered themegapaitan, looks good. the pork char siu tasted much better in the ramen then the one they used in the buns."
2536,Karan P.,1115,5,5/26/18,megapaitanis a true delight !!! it is a lot of foodspicy sauce really enhances the flavors greatly.ambiance is not very good but definitely worth the quality served
2537,Maria P.,1115,5,5/19/18,"best ramen i've ever had. it is a little hole in the wall and never not packed to the gills, but do not let that deter you. the wait is really short and you get to place your order while you wait, which is really efficient. just be aware that it is a cash only establishment.the food tasted heavenly! the bao bun was perfect. the bun itself was soft and fluffy and the pork was super thick, juicy, and flavorful. when i had the first taste of mymegapaitan, my insides melted into the most wonderful state of comfort and relaxation. all i wanted was to eat that giant bowl of soup on my couch, covered in a throw blanket, while watching netflix.do yourself a favor. stop by, have a bowl, and melt into wonderful relaxation like i did. it is a tiny spot but the food is amazing, the service is excellent, and the cleanliness is great a rating ."
2538,Trina V.,1115,5,5/19/18,"love it!this restaurant is pretty tiny. from what i can see, there is a handful of bar seats and couple of tables in the back. so be prepared to wait. i'm assuming the best time to go is right when they open both for lunch and dinner.write your name on the clip board and wait for them to take your order. like ramen parlor, you order while you wait and it is ready for you when you are seated.the bf and i got spicy pakistan you have a choice between pork and chicken. i ended up getting the pork. the broth does not look or taste spicy at first, but the spice definitely builds up. reminds me of the kind of spice you get from ramen parlor's lobster broth.megapaitan this one comes with char siu pork and pork belly. the char siu was delicious, but the pork belly was amazing. it just fell apart and melted in your mouth. bf loves daikokuya and he said it is comparable to their ramen.it is even better because it is a mix of the two ramen places that we love.overall, the broths, noodles, and meats were great. a definite must try if you are in the area."
2539,Viet T.,1115,5,5/3/18,"that broth is t h i c c thick. i came during a rather off time because there were about tables in the back and other people eating at the bar so they may not be as quick they were with me food came out in less than minutes, top ramen are not got nothing on totto for speed . it is a bit warm if you have counter seating but it is also fun watching the guys in the back assemble everything. service is brisk but friendly.big tip, the egg will be a bit coldlukewarm as a proper marinated egg should be so let it sit for a bit to warm the whites if a hot egg is your thing.so back to the first point that broth is t h i c c thick. it is a bit salty and i'm completely surprised it is all chicken. it is delicious. it is worth the hype. it is worth the sometimes hour long weekend wait not that i had to suffer this . you will save on lip balm. i had themegapaitanwhich came with shredded pulled pork, fatty pork belly, and charred chashu. the chashu is definitely one of the best bites. also there is pickled cabbage which really helps offset roundsoff everything i wish my bowl had more .prices are on par with most other ramen places which i feel is a dollar or higher than they should be but it is been set so. "
2540,B K.,1115,4,4/16/18,"went there for lunch on sat just past pm, no wait. cash only is a bummer but chase bank is blocks away so we stopped by before going to the restaurant. i ordered themegapaitanand it was delicious. the soup was savory and a nice change of pace if like me, you always go for tonkatsu ramen. the noodle had great mouth feel and the right amount of chew. for the soup was slightly too salty to have on its own after you have finished the noodle, which i do believe is always the case with them as my friend who went a couple of years ago also mentioned this."
2541,Siri C.,1115,5,1/5/18,"the thing i like about this place is the environment and the food. hand's down the best vegetarianramenin nyc. the flavor of thevegetableramenis enhanced by their super amazing garlic chili sauce. i make the trek just for their actual noodles and the way their broth makes it all come together. absolutely the best! would recommend to all my vegetarian friends.anticipate a min wait usually to be seated. food arrives quicker as the host takes your order when you check in to be seated. also, cash only. there are atms close by if you forget."
2542,Sean S.,1115,2,12/19/17,"no i was not terribly impressed.when outoftowners come to new york, and they are all hyped & worked up about a place, i should know automatically what i'm getting into. i had no idea about these silly long lines. it reminds me of magnolia's bakery. someone saw it on tv and then the whole tvwatchingtourist train poured into the station!what i tried to find was some veggie stuff on the menu. you know i do not like being forgotten. yes there is avegetableramen. it was just ok.besides the crappy services & the long lines, the food was basic. i'm sorry but i've been to tons oframenplaces both in tokyo, st marks place, flushing, and various other locations around the city. and i was not wowed here."
2543,Pranav G.,1115,5,11/12/17,my wife and i are vegetarians and we love thevegetableramen. servers are always quick! would recommend this place to everyone
2544,Nick M.,1115,5,7/11/17,"unique setting, you probably will not hear the music they play here anywhere else. really small and cramped but that quality has a certain charm to it here. phenomenalramen! thevegetableramenis vegan! make sure you add bean sprouts and nori! incredibly busy but the staff was always accommodating and nice and never felt like they were overwhelmed or like we were being rushed."
2545,Cortney S.,1115,5,7/2/17,"this was a great find for someramen. there was a bit of a wait, which just indicated even more that it was worth our time. we had thevegetableramenand the mega paitan. both came out super hot and looked just as good as it tasted. the staff was all super friendly and kind. be sure to perfect your chopstick skills and bring cash. this is a must try spot in the city!"
2546,Linh H.,1115,3,5/4/17,"i usually do not like chicken base soup forramenbut i came here because one of my friends really loves this place, also it is so famous so why not!i got extra spicy paitan, my friends got miso paitan andvegetableramen. i did not try theirs so i cannot talk about them.as i said, i prefer pork base so the broth did not impress me much, still creamy but lack of thickness. the char siu pork was good, i do not think i ever got any bad char siu fromramenrestaurants. one thing surprised me most was the chili oil, it was actually really spicy, they put it on the side so it is pretty convenient.we also got pork buns and avocado buns. the pork buns somehow were lack of flavor, i wish they put char siu pork instead of braised pork, after eating bun, i felt sick of that pork lol. the avocado buns were great, very simple but they put a nice dressing inside which made them tasty.we went there on saturday afternoon, there were not many people so we did not wait for too long. it is also always crowded so not a place for you to eat and talk because i felt like the staffs were rushing us when we were eating lol.overall, i'm not sure i would come back here again forramenbecause i've triedramensfrom other areas and they were much better. but i guesd when i really want a bowl oframenwhen i'm around here, i might consider this place or ippudo."
2547,C O.,1115,5,4/1/17,the original spot! love the uni over rice appetizer. and thevegetableramen really tiny spot so the wait time use to be a killer. it is a great place to walk into if there is no wait.
2548,Rene M.,1115,3,3/21/17,thevegetableramenwas good but their main mega paitan was very fatty could not finish the bowl. per the game it has is said it is ok. then again i have some in tokyo maybe i am biased lol
2549,David G.,1115,4,10/24/16,"it was a chilly october night, and we had just left the theater. we were craving something warm, satisfying, and inexpensive.ramensounded perfect. a quick yelp search showed that tottoramenwas just steps away from where we were.even though it was almost midnight, there was still a line to be seated at tottoramen. this was not surprising once i saw how tiny the place was just a handful of seats at a counter, and some cramped communal tables. the entire joint is the size of a shoebox. welcome to manhattan. thankfully, we only had to wait about minutes before being seated. to keep things moving efficiently, the hostess took our orders while we waited spicy nibo paitan for me, andvegetableramenfor my guest . once we were seated at one of the communal tables, our food came out within moments.theramenitself is quite good. it is all about the broth here rich, intense, flavorful. i also really enjoyed the noodles, which were sturdier than i'm used to al dente . the other components of the spicy nibo paitan were just okay. both the chicken and cabbage leaves were tough and rubbery, which was a bit of a letdown. i did manage to sneak in a taste of my guest'svegetableramen, and the veggies in that bowl were a lot better. all in all, tottoramenis a nice place to check out, but my favorite san diegobasedramenspots are still a notch above. side note tottoramenis cash only, so do not find yourself stranded with just your visa! "
2550,Judy L.,1115,4,7/30/16,"tottoramenwas everything years ago. now there are moreramenshops around and though they are not everything now, they are still consistently great. i'm used to this location when i visit the big apple and it is still my preference oframencompared to popular places, such as ippudo, in the city.unlike ippudo, the interior of tottoramenis no frills. it is a small space with four tables and the bar, with a tiny bathroom where you do all your business standing in the exact same spot. this place comes close toramenshops in japan.tottoramenis quite efficient. though the lines are not as crazy as they were years ago, you still have to put your name on the list and wait. they will call your party ahead of time to take your orders so when you get seated, your food is ready.i've tried almost everyramenhere and i can say the broth, al dente noodles and perfectly charred pork make their bowls quality. what makes this place stick out more for me is theirvegetableramen. it comes in regular and spicy options and both broths are so flavorful that you will not miss the meat."
2551,Rocio C.,1115,5,6/19/16,"perfection is the word that comes to my mind after having a spicy paitan with chicken. it had exactly the right amount of spiciness, the chicken was juicy and tasty, noodles perfectly cooked and it was served fast and at the right temperature. the service is friendly and efficient and i cannot wait to come back and try the miso paitan and thevegetableramen!"
2552,Aavody A.,1115,5,5/5/16,"ramen, hmmmm, a name that i dream about day in and day out. lol.i can eatramenwhatever time of day, whatever occassion it is, whatever mood i'm in. okay okay i am asian but then again you do not need to be asian to enjoy theramenhere. besides do not you want to see the real asians enjoying the meal in an asian restaurant which basically means it is really good because they know more of this stuff than some coming from someone who has eatenramenall over the world thisramenjoint is up there. i never make it here as it is in midtown and there is always always a long wait but my bf took the risk one night after seeing a show.it was past pm, they close at and the place is still packed. we were forewarned they will close soon but we assured them that we will be quick. we meant business.i ordered the spicy paitan and my bf ordered thevegetableramen. i had no words while i was eating mine. all that was coming out of my mouth was oooohs and aaaahs. meantime my bf was less than pleased than his. i tried his, ehhh, it was not something i would order but he really does not eat meat so that is what he can only order. maybe it was because it was cold out, or it was rainy, or i was hungry, but whatever the reason is i give this place stars. this is not the first time that all those reasons happened all at the same time in my life but this is the first time that i had given something stars with all those reasons.keep up the good work! i will be coming back."
2553,Leo L.,1115,2,4/29/16,"i heard so many great things about tottoramen. so, first day arrived nyc, we went straight to totto for a lunch. i ordered a spicy paitan and my husband ordered avegetableramen. we also ordered a appetizer, sesame chicken. if we did not order the appetizer, i would give stars for theramen. however, the appetizer was a huge disappointment. how can you cook a chicken so dry and hard to swallow it! seriously, anyone can make better boiled chicken at home with drip sesame sauce. my idea of a great or even just good restaurant every food should be at least at good standard across menu, not a great main course with a really bad appetizer!!!"
2554,Emily C.,1115,4,4/17/16,my favoritevegetableramenin the city and i'm not a vegetarian. noodles are cooked to perfection and the broth is delicious. the saba mackerel is really good too. we usually come weeknights to avoid crowds.
2555,Linh L.,1115,3,3/30/16,"came here for an afternoon lunch. the place is small, so there was a wait list. i put my name down. a few minutes later, the hostess came out and asked for the order. i guess it is good that they take your order while you wait, so that when you get seated, your order will arrive faster.i ordered the spicyvegetableramen. my order arrived within mins after i got seated. i noticed that theramencame with slices of avocado. that was really different. i do like avocado, but not in my bowl oframen. i did not like that mushy texture with my chewy noodle. for the broth, i thought the broth was really good and very flavorful. however, i ordered the spicy version of it, but i got the nonspicy. i was a little disappointed, but it was ok. the flavorful broth made up for it.will i come back again maybe "
2556,Katherine D.,1115,4,2/21/16,small dining area but very fast service with quality food. ordered the extra spicyramenwith chicken and thevegetableramen. both were great but the veggieramenreally stole the show! highly recommend!
2557,Satya V.,1115,5,2/4/16,"tottoramenis one of those places that make you appreciate the experience of living in new york. being a vegetarian, good vegetarianramenis normally a utopian concept and i had an aha moment when i first tasted the spicyvegetableramen. while i am sober these days, goodramenwith japanese beer tops several fancy fine dining experiences i have had. expect a long wait, however it is certainly wait the average minutes wait. this place is cash only and small. however it certainly is a warm and cozy experience. while many restaurants promote that winter season is ramenseason , i say all year is totoramenseason! "
2558,Jando S.,1115,5,2/3/16,"when it comes to broth related winter foods, people can rave about hot pot or pho all they want but for me, there is nothing more satisfying than a delicious bowl oframen. the complex flavors and textures make for a near euphoric experience for anyone who enjoys a quality noodle soup. often ippudo yelp.com biz ippudonyn,a may get the nod for the city's most wellknownramen, but my taste buds deem totto as the best in manhattan.there are multiple totto locations but this original spot is where its at. the subtle decor and intimate ambiance screams japan all the way, from the narrow interior to the line of up staff behind the counter conversing in japanese. stripped of any major pretension or fancy digs, this adds to the experience, even if the food presides above all.the price to be paid however, is a wait. solo diners are encouraged to sit at the bar, while the date group of will typically get one of the tables resting along the wall. i've heard nightmare scenarios of hour waits and such, but coming here at the very beginning of dinner service or with an hour till they close have been my saving grace. most of the time i'm just walking right in.their signature totto spicyramen . is delightful. i tend to add char siu for my protein and begin slurping the broth with no addons nearly immediately upon receipt. the addition of corn and extra noodles is never a bad thing but if one is go fullramenglutton, then the megaramen . is a much better choice. there is also the paitanramen . with al dente noodles swimming wonderfully in a chicken based broth. it reminds me of a souped up version pun intended of chicken noodle soup, but with way better noodles.for our seafood lovers, the niboramen is another specialtyramenwith a fish flavored rayu but retaining all elements of the paiten for an added kick. veggie friends have their ownramenstock to slurp from, an originalvegetableramen . and a spicy version for a more. add ons could be anything from corn to extra pork, but any add on only adds to the complexity of the soup. i still cannot bring myself to order their seasoned avocado when it drowns and eventually melts, clouding the broth. extra noodles however, is almost a requirement on my end.another reason i love totto is their approach on char siu bbq pork . they marinate the meat before charring the outside of it blow torch style and the fatty bits only add to the flavor when mixed in with the broth. pork buns for are a bit of an after thought but the char siu mayo don . is delicious. the rice has an essence of the pork while the yuzu really gives the dish some real punch palate wise.the service does their best to accommodate substitutions and requests. they may not seem the most friendly based on having to deal with waiting customers on a daily basis, but show them some respect and they will in turn do the same. it is cash only and leave the friends at home. going solo or having a patient dining companion makes the experience a whole lot simpler."
2559,Olivia R.,1115,4,1/12/16,"tottoramenis consistently great! i have had themisoramen, regularramen, andvegetableramenand love them all. thevegetableramenbroth is significantly lighter, but it is loaded withvegetables. compared to the otherramenit lacks flavor, but i love it! i always ask for the wavy noodles, i have never asked for the straight ones. the tuna don is excellent and a little spicy. i prefer the pork bun over the chicken bun it is more flavorful. i always ask for extra mayo also, just because it can be a little dry. overall the buns are juicy and good. the service is extremely quick so be prepared for a fast meal. they get you in and out! also, cash only!"
2560,Martina L.,1115,3,1/7/16," degree weather on a clear night made me craveramenfor dinner! if you are looking for a quick meal then come by yourself, otherwise expect to wait in line. even though i arrived around there was already a long line, but since i was by myself the hostess took my order and seated me right way at the bar and my order came about minutes later. i got thevegetableramenand i gave it three stars because i wish the portion was bigger for the price some tofu or egg would be nice! , but otherwise i enjoyed the authentic taste and the overall efficiency was exactly what i needed for the night. it definitely keeps up with the fastpaced nyc vibe!"
2561,Anisha R.,1115,5,11/19/17,"come winters and you will find me there every week! it is just so comforting to have a hot ramen being cooked right in front of you on a cold winter day! its hands down one of the best ramen places in the city. this place is not for you to hang out with friends you come, enjoy your food and leave, i think that is the idea. they are super busy , you will have to put names once you reach. the service is pretty fast so you will get your seats fast but even if you wait a bit trust me it is worth the wait. try thespicybambooshootsand the pork chicken bun. it is simply amazing. bring cash, they do not accept cards."
2562,Jennifer T.,1115,5,3/24/17,"so totto. i love it here.i'm not here to get into the ippudo vs totto debate. both are swell but incomparable in my opinion.totto is chinese influenced japanese ramen, all chicken based. the broth is super creamy and opaque, like a chicken tonkotsu . every bowl here rules, both paitan and vegetable options. their rayu is off the hook. it is a place where you do not have to be subtle with what you put in your bowl.garlic paste bring it.spicybambooshootsthat are hot af where i need to rinse some of the peppers in my soup to eat them fantastic. you really get the opportunity to build up your soup here over time. which yes is probably only around minutes, people are hungry waiting outside to replace you.it is a tiny joint, cash only, in and out during rush hours which here seems to be every hour. but it is lively and your food comes out almost immediately.come alone, snag a seat at the counter. or come with a partner in crime, but any more than two people and you are in for a brutal wait. luckily you can get drunk around the corner at the countless bars littering th ave.however if you manage to snag a seat right before closing within reason at the counter you have the opportunity to get to know the staff and enjoy some sake together. at least from my experience. everyone is super friendly.also as a last note, they slice their scallions diagonally so it is easier to pick up with your chopsticks as you pick up your noodles. considerate."
2563,Buffy M.,1115,5,4/23/16,"i wanted to go to totto ramen the last time i was in nyc, but did not make it. this time i took advantage of a beautiful nyc spring afternoon to walk over to totto ramen.they just opened, got a seat at the counter and watched it all happen. i got their basic ramen, with chicken, seasoned egg andspicybambooshoots. it so did not disappoint! this was some seriously good ramen!"
2564,Wei T.,1115,4,9/27/15,"best ramen in mahattan. strongly recommend the extraspicychicken broth ramen! the sauce is on the side and super good edegea+aeae e ie pfrom japen , and must go with thespicybambooshoot!"
2565,Apple L.,1115,2,7/7/15,do not understand why this place is this popular. their chicken soup is way too thick. egg is overboiled.spicybambooshootsis toospicyand has no other flavor.
2566,Jonathan N.,1115,3,11/17/14,"come early! there was a line right as they opened that continued to get longer as time passed. we only had to wait for minutes since we got there a little after opening. the place is cramped and small but the turnaround time is not bad.pork buns meat was kind of chewy and the sauce was not great. this needed some hot sauce, but be careful they will charge you for it. i think ippudo's pork buns blows this place out of the water.the mega ramen is a superbowl of totto ramen with a lot of additions and more broth noodles. the noodles are al dente, which i love. the pork is not good and some pieces are tough. the broth is just okay and i did not like thespicybambooshoots.tottospicyramen similar to the mega, but served with some chili oil.the ramen here is okay and not something i would wait for. a lot of my friends compared this place to ippudo, but i think there is not even a slight competition. the flavor of ippudo is way better. i will probably not be back any time soon as there are many ramen places around. and there is also ippudo."
2567,Thomas A.,1115,3,10/6/14,"i think too many people hyped this place up for me. i came here on a sunday night around . we put our names down, and we noticed a long line. the wait was approximately minutes.to expedite the service, some ppl who were waiting to be seated had their orders taken already.we were lucky enough to sit at the ramen bar, so we got to see the magic happen.i ordered the porkspicyramen, while she ordered the extraspicyramen. for mine, i ordered extra char siu, a seasoned egg, andspicybambooshoots.my bowl came out and it was missing the seasoned egg andspicybambooshoots. she ordered extra char siu, a seasoned egg, and regularbambooshoots. hers came with a full egg andspicybambooshootson the side. so in essence, the cooks gave her myspicybambooshootsand my egg! failthe ramen itself was eh whatever. i mean it was not mindblowing. the pork was yummy. i really loved the rayu spicyoil , you just need to make sure to mix it around the broth well enough st. it def offers a nice kick as i was sweating from the spice as well as the heat from the boiling water that was cooking the ramen in front of me.i felt like the service was kind of urging us to rush our meal and get out, but as the fatties we are, we ordered kae dama and dove into round of the ramen experience.the ramen the nd time around were more al dente st time was a bit overcooked .overall it is an okay spot, but i still prefer ippudo's akamaru modern. maybe i should come back here and try the miso ramen with some rayu. that should be a better comparison."
2568,Carla Z.,1115,4,9/17/14,"elbow your way through the line, write your name on the clipboard & patiently wait to be seated in a super duper tiny hole in the ground then prepare your tummy for an amazing bowl of ramen.we started with the pork buns and these were delicious. surprising because they came out in about mins no joke . also got the seaweed salad. the totto version is super cold, fresh & surprisingly a little more acidic than normal not in a bad way .i also tried thespicytotto ramen with boiled egg & char siu pork. delicious fatty pork that is broiled and perfectly seasoned. the broth was delicious though i've had better . i think their broth lacks depth because it is chicken basedi love the broth at momofuku fyi. fortunately, the noodles were bouncy and executed well.if you are turned off by getting up close & personal with strangers do not come here. totto is very very intimate but i think that adds authenticity and charm.the only thing i do not like is that they charge you for things that are basic toppings i had to pay an extra dollar for a boiled egg. i also had to pay for thespicybambooshoots warning superspicy! "
2569,Jeff K.,1115,4,8/7/14," . stars, i rounded up because of the food. it would be a solid stars, if it were not for the wait.this place is crazy. i came here with someone and the line was out the door. i went to put my name down on the list and found out the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. instead of leaving and coming back, we decided to wait. apparently if they call your number and you are not there, you have to put your name on the list again and you go to the back of the line. they need a better system.when my name was called, about an hour later, we were seated at a small table in the back. the restaurant is really small. there is a bar and a fair amount of tables, but everything is really crammed in.i ordered the miso ramen with an extra helping and an order ofspicybambooshoots. when you mix thespicybambooshootswith the miso ramen broth, it tastes pretty good. it adds a bit of spice to it. the ramen noodles were soft and chewy.the service was ok. the waiters were attentive and our waters were always filled."

2572,James I.,1115,5,4/23/14,"i've neglected to give totto a proper review. yes, i've failed. i've eaten here once a week for the past months and simply have been focused on enjoying it rather than giving it props.simplicity is king here. this is hands down my favorite bowl of chicken broth based ramen. it is really something incredible with it is deep, rich flavor balanced by intermittent crunches of onion. this base has brought me back, week after week, like an addict. paitan for the win the best bowl of chicken soup you have ever had.their rayu spikedspicyramen builds upon the bowl of paitan with a variance on the aftertaste and a punch of heat. delicious, familiar, yet unique.the miso ramen is something way foreign to me. i've had it a few times. it really requires you to be in the mood for that nutty, fermented excursion. they use very high quality miso and this is the loudest bowl they make in my opinion. it is quite different than any other bowl of miso i've had yet. with all that said, it is not my favorite in the city momo . but regardless, i know it is there, waiting for me.the pork buns are solid. small yet pcked with flavors that i have not found anywhere else. their pork is so simple. but maybe that is just it. they have taken the time to figure out the simplest methods and deliver them almost flawlessly in one pork bun. definitely my top favorite pork buns in the city, probably sitting strong at # .the mega ramen. hahah! this is they are answer to the american portions that you really want. and yes, i caved and had myself a bowl. it is everything you want it to be. packed with all the usual pork suspects you desire, this one is for those days where a kaedama is not enough.the toppings are perfect. all of them. favs are the kikurage, corn, andspicybambooshoots. their egg is flawless. i'm getting hungry. i'm starting to shake!totto, i salute you!ps pm is the time to go at either location. go at , and you might be too late! pm lunch is also a fail safe time."

2575,Deoroop M.,1115,5,12/18/13,"after a long awaited journey, i finally trekked all the way to totto ramen to gorge upon the ramen of all ramens.blistering cold, snow, sleet and rain in the middle of the afternoon and yet, the foyer of totto was packed with angry, disgruntled customers. that is when i figured out this place is the real deal. having to wait a measly fifteen minutes because sadly i was dining for one , there was a target on my back because the wait list was not getting any shorter, i scurried in and quickly took my seat.it is quite and experience to see where and how all the magic happens and i think this is one of the most unique things about this place. totto ensures the customer that making and crafting ramen is not just a streamline process but it is truly an art that gives birth to a scrumptious, hot piping soup to be enjoyed by all walks of life.the chicken ramen was my optimal choice. word to the wise, extra addons are a must. since i was a novice, thebambooshootsand seasoned boiled egg were the only options i chose. next time, thespicybambooshootswill be my victim. chicken broth, simply exquisite and it was the perfect dish to power me through a brutal, wintry day. the ramen was perfectly cooked and neither too soft or too chewy, just the right consistency. could have used a few extra slivers of chicken to compliment my ramen but i guess that is why they have addons for a reason. regardless of that fact, is was still a very filling meal.totto ramen, you have truly outdone yourself. you deserve to be hailed as a master among all ramens and gladly submit to your each and every will."
2576,Nicole S.,1115,4,12/6/13,"if you ask someone about ramen in new york, two names usually come to mind ippudo and totto. being that we gave ippudo a try last visit, it was now totto's turn.i went with the tottospicyramen. i'm not usually a fan of straight ramen noodles, but their homemade noodles were good. their special paitan chicken broth was delicious! it was garlicky, creamy and extremely comforting for that day's cold weather. to make the dishspicy, they add aspicysesame oil which gives the broth an even deeper flavor. the ramen is topped off with scallion, cha siu pork, a handful of bean sprouts and a piece of nori.additional toppings are available to add to your noodles such as corn, avocado, and chicken. i'm a big fan of mushrooms so i added kikurage mushrooms. i addedspicybambooshoots, but that came on a separate plate. thebambooshootswere covered in a hot chili powder which did not give it much of a taste.my totto vs. ippudo verdict i would go back to both of them. both are delicious. totto will fill you up with their generous amount of noodles and toppings, but my stomach favors ippudo's broth.service such fast turnaround! we were asked what we wanted within a few minutes of sitting down. thank goodness i looked at the menu online the night before, but i panicked and forgot to add an egg. our bowls probably came out within about minutes of us ordering.shoutout to the worker calling out names on the list. he kept my friend and i entertained with his side comments.and lol at him pronouncing the name phoebe as fayohbee .what to know cash only chicken or vegetarian broth sign your name on the list. many people get discouraged about the wait and end up leaving. do not be that person who thinks they have an hour to roam the street and ends up getting their name called while they are gone. expect to wait. we waited about minutes on friday afternoon. it is a small place. do not come with a large group."
2577,Jamie C.,1115,4,12/2/13,"imo, far better than ippudu around the corner! totto ramen has become one our favorite spots in our neighborhood walkable distance too! try to avoid coming in the weekends it is almost a sure shot it is packed with tourist trying to get a taste if their mouth watering delicious goodness of a chicken broth soup! if you have no other option but to come on a weekend, make sure you get there before pm. otherwise is a guaranteed minimum of a hour wait time. good thing there are many bars within the vicinity! i would suggest to put your name down, and go around the corner to have a beer or a shot! it will keep you warmer during the cold nyc winters. i would not recommend chilling at the bar for more than mins depending on how many people are in the waiting list before you, cuz if you are not present when they call your name your name is crossed off for good and.it is back if the line for ya buddy! yes, unfortunately this has happened to me. i usually order the extraspicytotto ramen . it is just called extraspicycuz they give you a side of their special totto ramen garlic and chili oil hot because. imo, it is really not thatspicy. you can still enjoy your ramen. and on the nights i'm looking for an extra kick in the mouth of flamingspicygoodness, i ask the server for thespicyred chili flakes. so delicious!! some favorited add ons of mine would include thespicybambooshoots additional , soft boiled egg additional , and cooked to perfection on most days , and the corn . the ramen is comes with a piece of nori japanese dried seaweed , generous portions of thinly sliced scallions, and plenty of cooked bean spouts that add some dimension to your ramen experience.the noodles more thin than typical ramen joints, but the texture is chewy at first but as you work your way through the bottom of the bowl it is basically perfect to the last drop of soup. never too soggy! which is a surprise and difficult to achieve in most ramen spots.the soup not too salty normally. the only thing i would have to complain about of their consistency of the soup. some days it seems over cooked as the broth seems super thick and on this days taste substantially more salty. the broth made from chicken instead of the typical pork broth. so that is definitely something worth trying!meat selection your choice or either slices of char sui roasted pork or slices of chicken breast.overall, the staff are friendly and attentive. it is definitely one of the favorites since i've moved to manhattan!"
2578,Sandy C.,1115,3,10/14/13,"oh geez, i'm probably going to get stoned by ramen aficionados.but here's my paltry two cents it was all right. the noodles were nice and leggy and springy. thespicybroth and the miso one were decent. i think it is cool that they blow torch the pork. and the egg is superbly marinated with shoyu, mirin, and brown sugar.it just did not all meld for me. i felt like thespicywas just a slick of chili oil on top instead of integrated into the broth i needed a side ofspicybambooshootsto give it a real kick . and the temperature of the egg was nowhere close to the broth so the contrast was kinda jarring and failed to highlight the unctuous ooziness of the yolk.maybe my expectations were too high. after all, i would read the reviews and got there min before opening to ensure i got one of the first seats at the bar for a weekday lunch note once you are min out, people start to descend . so maybe my anxiety euphoria at beating the line just set me up for hype fatigue. the cooks behind the bar are pretty badass though. i would go again to check out their show, cluck my tongue in sympathy at the long line outside, enjoy a decent bowl of noodles, and get cramped up in the america's most miniscule bathroom hard to beat that fun package deal."
2579,Michelle T.,1111,4,1/13/17,"one of my favorite steakhouse in nyc. i came here during restaurant week and it was so worth it. we started off with crab cakes that tasted fresh and had a wonderful texture. the steak is so juicy and has lots of flavors. then, we finished it off with their signature dessert baked alaska. the staffs were very friendly. it is a nice romantic elegant place for a date night. overall, i will be coming back again regardless of restaurant week deal or not."
2580,Steve S.,1111,4,7/30/17,"went for restaurant week and had a fabulous dinner at the beautiful delmonico's.i will definitely be back for a nonrestaurant week meal.my friend and i were boring and ordered the same thing.starter iceberg wedge salad. this was kind of disappointing. it was small and sort of a barely there starter. not awful but just meh . however, i did not come here for that.main the classic steak. so good! i love a good medrare steak and the potatoes served with it were excellent! definitely worth the supplement charge to the rw menu.desert we shared a baked alaska which they allegedly invented and the chocolate cake. both desserts were very good. i had never had baked alaska, it always struck me as an old person's dessert, but it was so delicious. it is a shame that they do not light it on fire like i've seen on cruise ships. however, i get it, that would be annoying to do on a nightly basis.the service was very friendly. we had this russian eastern euro guy who was super nice. some people saw rw is a bad time to try a new restaurant. i think when the servers are friendly even though you are getting a deal it makes you want to come back to the restaurant, which i definitely do!all in all, a great summer night!will definitely be back."
2581,Roman S.,1111,1,2/4/18,"you read about it being a landmark you read about it being one of the oldest steakhouses on the eastern coast then you go check it out and it is a pile of shit over another pile of shit mixed with another pile of shit thru and thru. dang, how do these people eat there in that smoke "
2582,D P.,1111,5,10/8/17,"the entire staff makes you feel like family. dennis the owner is always there and makes sure the entire restaurant runs like a welloiled machine.i love how the menu changes with the seasons, keeps it interesting. the sides are all ridiculously delicious, but the mushrooms and brussel sprouts are my absolute favorites. the pistachio ice cream with a little drizzle of sambuca white is to die for.we used to go to a place up the block, but the entire team here and the quality of food keeps us coming back. most of the menu is organic and from local farms, which i think they should definitely advertise more!the main dining hall is great for larger groups or if you want a little more privacy. the bar is better for couples or if you just want to have fun and socialize there are smaller tables to sit as well . we have also had quite a few private parties in three different rooms before downstairs, next to the bar through a hallway and a closed off area at the back of the dining hall and they have all been wonderful. top of the line service every time!"
2583,Mark W.,1111,3,5/24/17,"i was really excited about going to delmonico's and for the most part, the food did not disappoint. we started with two martinis, the lettuce wedge with blue cheese, and the dressed crab, all were delicious. we had the tomahawk steak for two, , with onion rings, whipped potatoes and creamed spinach. the onion rings were okay, the steak was perfect as were the creamed spinach and whipped potatoes. i had a great glass of pinot with dinner followed by a shared blueberry pie and two cappuccinos. the pie was underwhelming but the cappuccinos were great.total before tip was .now the disappointing part . the service. the wait staff was too busy chatting with each other to offer pepper for my salad even after repeatedly asking for help. the hostess has way too much attitude. overall it just felt sloppy and amateurish for a fine dining experience.i would give them a for the food but a for the service is a stretch. overall a . glad we went but for the price there are many better options in manhattan."
2584,Emily G.,1111,5,3/22/18,"i work in the area and friday's after work my colleagues and i look to dine in different restaurants we stumble upon delmonico's many times but looks very pricey so some of our colleagues wallets get intimidated, well i've decided to invite a friend and return to delmonico's and i'm happy i did it is totally worth it! the ambiance in the main room it is so welcoming and food is definitely on point, service was ok but still gets stars from me, our server looked distracted and he kinda had a weird stare made us a little uncomfortable, but overall the food was very tasty i had the filet mignon the perfect mr i ever had and my friend had the cut steak and the wine selection was on point. i will definitely will be returning here. definitely recommend"
2585,Kenji A.,1111,5,2/13/18,"honestly, our best meal in ny. we took advantage of the restaurant week dinner menu, and it was so worth it. we did not know much about the restaurant, the d ] c cor made me go and research as we waited for our meal. the history that surrounds the place, you can feel it i almost wish there was a little history book i could have flipped through at the table. our server and the bussers were fantastic my water glass was never empty and i drink water like a camel. filet mignon and the potatoes that accompanied it was perfect not too rich and the steak had the right searing on it. the cheesecake at the end was the right size and taste was bar none to any cheesecake i had in ny. price point was just about the same as any restaurant for a steak dinner . going during restaurant week just made it that much more of a value. we definitely intend to go back the next time we are in ny."
2586,Thomas M.,1111,5,3/19/18,"best ribeye steak you can get anywhere.end of story. decor is old and dated but fits the scene which is old wall street, get the ribeye and you will be fine."
2587,Michelle L.,1111,2,9/14/16,"i have a lot of up and down opinions on this place but unfortunately the downs won. in regards to the restaurant, it is quite large with a beautiful, old american steakhouse vibe in relation to the initial entrance of the restaurant. we were seated deeper into the restaurant, past the bar in what seemed to be annex from the main, slightly more plain compared to the initial look of the restaurant.we were a group of and overall, the food was meh compared to other steakhouses i have tried. we started off with the bacon and although the portion size was adequate, the cuts given were a mismatch. i got a piece just of pure fat that never should have made it on the plate. flavoring was there but became a let down with the overwhelming fat. then the sides and main entr ] c e came. we shared the asparagus, hash browns and mushrooms. sides were good and enough to share between people. they were on par with expectations so that was nice.for my main entr ] c e, i shared the porterhouse for two, asking for medium rare. we unfortunately got rare. like super rare. i like bloody red meat but when i request for medium rare at a respected steakhouse, i want to see what i ordered. it was so rare i almost could not swallow but had to consider the amount of money i was shelling out. the filet was buttery and soft and the strip had good flavor. unfortunately, the execution was not there and coupled with my bacon mishap, i was not pleased. combine the bad service and the whole dinner experience became a flat two stars. our service was so slow and we were constantly trying to flag them down to reorder wine bottles and request for more iced water. i almost wanted to just ask them to leave the pitcher of water at the rate we were getting refills. there was no attention paid to us and it took forever just to get their attention to ask for the check.with the painstakingly poor service and food just being average below average compared to other expensive steakhouses i have had , i was quite disappointed with this experience."
2588,JoDe R.,1111,5,8/19/17,wonderful food & service!!lobster omggggg amazing!!!filet mignon superb!great evening!
2589,Ji T.,1111,5,1/28/18,"if you are in town and want to try out the delmonico steak or many other dishes that were famously originally created from the oldest restaurant in america, you must rsvp via opentable at least a day ahead. there is also a bar section and its own entrance. the delmonico steak itself does not come with any sides, i highly recommend my creamed spinach because you want to morally feel healthy when you are chowing down on a thick slab of cow."
2590,David P.,1111,5,3/17/18,"best steak i have had in my life. the atmosphere is great, as well as the service there. the steaks are bigger than i expected. my wife and i definitely will be going back!"
2591,Mohsin R.,1111,5,2/17/18,i can see why this place has been around for years! the steak was perfect all the way through and the char was splendid! the king crab mac n cheese was amazing and the creaminess complimented the steak perfectly!
2592,Rebecca L.,1111,3,8/28/16,"delmonico's offers a nice upscale dining experience with attentive and friendly service, however, i was not very impressed with the food. i came here this summer and ordered off the restaurant week dinner menu. i ordered the lobster newberg, filet mignon, and the cheesecake. the lobster newberg was a nice unique appetizer, however the filet mignon was a little bland and soggy in texture. the bread basket was soft and chewy on the inside but a little too tough on the outside. the cheese cake was warm and creamy."
2593,Kool M.,1111,3,2/8/18,"a new york institution, an icon. one of the first real restaurants in america. recently restored, do they rest on their laurels, definitely. however, it is the place where lobster newburg and baked alaska was created."
2594,Eugene K.,1111,5,6/6/18,"excellent steak and sides. even better service, which is becoming rare in nyc. the manager came around several times asking how everything is going. they do not just ask they actually care about the impression that you walk away with. it is a little on the expensive side, but you come for the experience, the history, and then the food. a remnant of a time when fine dining meant something on a wholly different level."
2595,Sara W.,1111,4,9/28/16,"delmonico's is an institution in the financial district. it has a beautiful oldworld steakhouse vibe with it is lacquered woodwork and it is crisp white linens. the entrance i came in takes you into the bar cafe which is suppose to be the cheaper section to eat in . bar is large and square shaped sitting in the middle of the room. past that are two separate dining rooms, one is about the same size as the room with the bar, and the other is a large dining room. we ate at a table near the bar.we ordered calamari, chips with guacamole and an entree. appetizers were really tasty. calamari was cooked perfectly, seasoned nicely and had a nice chipotle mayo dipping sauce. chips and guac were what you would expect, good, but nothing spectacular. for my lunch i had a burger which was delicious. cooked and seasoned to perfection i literally have no complaints on the food. service was great, exactly what you would expect for delmonico's, the biggest issue i have is with the price. delmonico's is extremely expensive so i never go out of my way to go there, but they are catering to a specific audience and i understand that. only other complaint i have is that the menu is pretty dated. we are living in the golden age of food so although customers expect the food to taste amazing and it should for what they charge we are also tired of seeing the same old menu and want new and exciting food to try."
2596,Sarah M.,1111,4,12/20/16,"we usually just go to the grill area, and i'm a fan. service is just as good as in the restaurant and they make awesome burgers.my one complaint is that my last burger was definitely not medium rare but it was so juicy i survived."
2597,Seunghwan J.,1111,3,2/28/18,"as what it is known for, delmonico's steak is between good and great. at least, you would not be disappointed if you are looking for a good quality beef cooked in moderately gourmet style.i tried delmonico classic bone in day dry aged steak during nyc restaurant week and it was better than i expected. the steak was well seasoned and came out to be perfect medium rare as requested. it was worth the price regarding how most restaurants fail to even get the order right these days.nothing so special about maplebrook farm burrata. it was just regular salad. the presentation was great. i wish i had taken a picture of it.let us talk about the desserts. both dark chocolate mousse cake and new york style cheesecake are beyond great. they are one of the best desserts i had throughout my foodie journey. mousse cake had that crunch layer at the top and it was delicately soft inside. most importantly, it perfectly captured the correct sweetness required to not bore your palate and maintain consistency. i would say the cheesecake was amazing as well. what is so great about their desserts is that they are not too sweet and not too blend.there is one problem with this restaurant their services. staffs are not really motivated to work. i could feel their frustration and annoyance.while food is the most important part in restaurant review, services are also part of it. they need to train their servers better."
2598,Kenny C.,1111,3,8/20/15,"i would been to delmonico's kitchen in midtown before worked in the same building but never made it out to the historic original in fidi. well, estaurant week provided the perfect excuse!their rw was pretty ridiculous, and not in a good way. nearly everything had a supplementary cost, and if you wanted to stick to the dinner, you only had a handful of choices. that said, they had a lot of their standards on the list, so it was still a decent way to try the bucket list items.as an appetizer, we did the oysters, which were fine. we got the west coast selection, but they did not bother letting us know where they were from. red flag maybe. but they were fresh enough.for a starter, i had their famous lobster newberg which was a supplement . i have to say, it was a hefty portion of basically half a lobster. the sauce was creamy and rich, but sparse so it was not overly heavy. definitely worth trying as a starter, but i do not know if i could handle a whole entree of it.for my main, i had the grilled filet mignon. it was okay, but i've had better cuts elsewhere even in their midtown location . no doubt they were saving some choice cuts for restaurant week. either that, or it was just overrated.also tried the chicken a la keene, which is another signature dish of theirs, and that was highly disappointing. the chicken was way overcooked and dry as all hell. maybe a bad example because they are not used to cooking rw portions either that, or it just sucked.for dessert, i had the dark chocolate mousse cake, which had a nice salted caramel sauce. thought it was fine, but nothing extraordinary.the baked alaska, on the other hand, was both beautiful and so, so heavy. i get that baked alaskas take some amount of work, but for a supplement, they should have just made it smaller and more manageable. two people could have shared it. oh well, the walnut cake and banana gelato was tasty though.they also had a house montepulciano d'abruzzo my favorite red wine , which was surprisingly good for just a bottle during rw. yum.one last thing we had a reservation a few weeks in advance and were seated in the room downstairs in the dickens alcove . i'm not saying they were seating all the minorities together, but. there were only two tables of white people downstairs one of which was a large group , and upstairs was all white people. maybe it is a dress code thing, or maybe it is because they did not want rwers to take up valuable space upstairs, or maybe they just do not like people who book on open table. i do not know and i will let you draw your own conclusions, but when they start surrounding your table with asian tourists, you get the hint."
2599,Samantha L.,1111,5,7/7/17,the ambiance was amazing the food was great and the staff was so nice. it was a short wait to be seated. the waiter was very attentive. the food came in a decent amount of time. i had the calamari to start. my only issue with it was the soppressata it mad the calamari taste a bit too much on the saltier side but the crunch was great and the meat was moist and the flavors were spot on. the steak was cook beautifully. a nice medium and well crusted.
2600,Jessica L.,1111,2,8/1/16,"came here for restaurant week and got the seasonal soup gazpacho , petit filet mignon, and baked alaska supplement . obviously the restaurant itself is beautiful with outstanding decorations, but i've got to say i've had better steak. i'm not sure if it was because it was restaurant week and maybe they are using lower quality meats, but the filet mignon was dry and not very tender i did order medium rare and it looked medium rare, which confused me more . maybe i should have tried a different steak, but the others were a supplemental charge, which negates the worth of restaurant week. also, the baked alaska was not as phenomenal as expected it was a bit heavy and very fragrant. i would go with the chocolate mousse the next time."
2601,Hilary L.,1111,5,8/24/16,came here for restaurant week with friends and we had a wonderful time! the food was alright despite the price tag on them. i was more fascinated with the history behind the restaurant than my dinner.
2602,Gourmand M.,1111,4,8/14/17,"yes, it is a good steakhouse with good dishes but not the best. yes, delmonico's cut is a legend but they have been taking advantage of the name and history."
2603,Daniel C.,1111,5,2/20/18,great traditional dinner. steak was super nice and priced reasonably. service is awesome.
2604,Callie C.,1111,5,2/11/18,"my boyfriend and i went for restaurant week and it was lovely! for the value of the meal, the portions were smaller than what i would imagine they normally are but it was worth paying for the meal at a fraction of the price. our server was very attentive and we were placed in a separate room so our date was much more intimate. i also made our reservation on the opentable app and checked off that it was my birthday and my dessert came with a candle! they really went above and beyond with the service."
2605,Shannon B.,1111,5,7/2/17,"this was the absolute best restaurant i have ever been to. and for me to say that is really crazy. my dad came to nyc to visit me, so i though it would be cool to take him to the oldest steakhouse un nyc. the look and feel is obviously old school nyc which is just fun because you do not ever see that anymore but let us get to the food. we started off with the crab newberg and holy cow one of the best things one ever tasted. absolutely unreal. we also had the tuna tartare and that was heavenly. i did not think it could get any better until my chicken arrived and yeah it was amazing which was not surprising. i also had the creamed spinach. i am actually coming back in weeks with my friends who are visiting and i am so excited!"
2606,Kevin J.,1111,4,10/19/16,ambience was awesome. a friend of mind took me out for a late birthday dinner.the steak was great and the spinach sides was amazing. too bad we did not pair it with the wine.
2607,Michael B.,1111,3,11/4/16,there classic delmonico steak was good but was not overly impressed by the rest of the meal. very pricey and i am not one to complain. hostess was not dressed for the caliber of clients. food was good atmosphere excellent i would have given stars if the details were paid attention too.
2608,Christina M.,1111,2,11/2/17,disappointed. to be fair the quality of the food was very good but besides that service was subpar and the ladie's restrooms at the rest stop on the nj parkway are by far up to better standards. attentive service was nonexistent. after the server explained that they pool their tips together it made more sense. one of the two women's stalls was a mess with a clogged toilet and neither had toilet paper. i would have expected way more for a meal. save your time and money and eat elsewhere!!
2609,Pamela L.,1111,1,10/10/18,"although i had a confirmed reservation for delmonico's for weeks, they called three days before to tell me i could only sit in the basement because they booked a large party. guess i'm never giving them a second chance. i also guess my money was not big enough for them."
2610,Fred G.,1111,1,9/15/18,"i have eaten here many times. this time the flies were everywhere. little little flies while i was eating. such a classy restaurant with great staff, why do they have fruit flies it do not make sence"
2611,Derian C.,1111,1,8/23/18,i was mistreated by the manager staff at delmonicos steakhouse when i ordered food from the bar. i was asked for collateral in order to have my food. their was bartenders serving me for some odd reason. well the manager did not serve me she just wanted to confirm my order and take my card. i told the first server what i wanted to eat and after i told her the manager came to confirm my order and asked for my card after getting my order. she said it is busy tonight so i'm going to need your card . mind you it was not busy at the bar and it is still a abhorrent excuse because i'm staying at the bar. at that moment i got a weird feeling in my stomach after i was asked for my card to eat at the bar. minutes later a caucasian gentleman walks in and sit right next to me and makes a order.no collateral was asked from the gentleman and my blood started to boil. so after my appetizer i asked to pay my bill because i felt immensely uncomfortable and just disgusted after such foul treatment. the first bar tender that took my order who served my food offered me a free drink to stay after i explained to her what is going on in my head right now because she knew it was wrong. then she begged me not to leave for like minutes and to just eat the steak or have it to go. i felt so embarrassed and confused like what did i do to be mistreated like this.i've sent a email and wrote a message on their site about what happened. because i'm still very upset with more details.
2612,Amirali S.,1111,1,6/22/18,"one the worst services i got at this level of restaurants.it is just a name and the staff did not behaved well and rude.do not recommend it it at allafter spent for , we deserve more."
2613,Katie F.,1111,1,5/23/18,worst service ever. manager is a total jerk. screwed up our meals twice and overheard manager saying do not give them anything free they are tourists . do not go here.
2614,Deb S.,1111,1,5/15/18,tired old men serving tired old banquet food and a wait staff that thinks they are doing you a favor. save your money. strike off your bucket list. the most overpriced worthless meal ever.
2615,Ali M.,1111,1,1/28/18,"too bad i missed the review about the roaches before i went or i would not have the opportunity to write this review today.i am not certain how this place has so many awesome reviews based upon my most recent experience. it is very well possible that i personally expect a higher degree towards excellence if i am dining at an establishment well known over the years for top quality food service delivery. i was disappointed with my first and last visit to this restaurant. my main gripe with this place is the temperature of the food. if i order braised short ribs i expect the dish to come with a temperature rivaling hot or at least close to just coming out of the oven . unfortunately, it was not and neither were the rest of the dishes presented to our table of four. after a thoroughly disappointing meal for all of us we decided to order the absolute worst dessert in the history of desserts not to die for.the baked alaska. wow! was it gross. the banana flavored cake with gritty hard frozen vanilla ice cream and the scorched fluff exterior made for a dessert not worth tasting. power to all of the people that dine here for the status because that must be the only reason to frequent a dungeon like this. shame on you delmonico for ripping people off over years. everyone should do themselves a favor and if you go to the restaurant and do not like the food make sure to let the server know. it is apparent that no one in the kitchen either cares or is aware of the atrocities leaving the cooktop. thumbs down all around!meals all of them are over priced but these are the main dishes we haddelmonico signature steaknot warm but tender. had better elsewheredelmonico potatoesworth a try, but who comes to a steakhouse only for potatoes lamb chopsthis is better at texas de brazil at any location you can find and it is endless when you go there. can someone from delmonico's go taste this item at a restaurant that knows how this should be done braised short ribi had better during a demonstrative speech in college when someone brought to class in a bucket. not a good dish at delmonico's by any means. i have been to a number of fine dining establishments and this one is my top worst on the list so far "
2616,Elif K.,1111,1,11/18/17,"very disappointed with the level of service and disrespectfulness we received last night. this is really not a classy establishment as advertised. i got yelled at by a bartender and our waiter was nothing short of snotty and disrespectful.we were directed to the bar to have a drink while waiting for our table. bar grill area was very crowded and two bartenders behind the bar were clearly overwhelmed. after waiting for solid mins for the bartender fill drink tickets, my vodka soda came out with a very big dose of attitude from the bartender. when i asked to see the wine list for a glass and delmonico's does not have one online , bartender yelled at me for not having my full order ready. then not to mention waiting additional mins to close my tab.when seated i asked our waiter if they had a sommelier that night. he said no and tried to upsell wines that he actually was not very knowledgable about i am a certified sommelier myself . we were very bothered by his snotty attitude and such low level of service, that we had to excuse ourselves and leave before ordering anything. sad how they treat customers who are clearly willing to generously spend money on good food and wine and want to have a pleasant experience."
2617,Yuk C.,1111,1,11/3/17,"what a disappointment to this beautiful restaurant. we came here with a group of on saturday night for some quality meats.cons about an hour ticket time for apps and entrees. inconsistency in temperature. i ordered my steak medium rare and got black and blue. another friend ordered it medium and got rare. crispy onions was stale on other all other steaks. i confronted the waiter if they forgot the orders and rushed out the two steaks which were under cooked. he denied the fact, but i guaranteed that was the case. i do not really like the spit special so i did not send it back. at least the manager comped us a free round of drinks. the cook on hot grill that night should go back to the cold apps line.pros lobster newburg. i will give that stars alone, but there is no excuse for messing up the temperature on a steak.tip still gave %, but there are better steakhouses in nyc double eagle, even lugers,. "
2618,Rochelle W.,1111,1,10/14/17,"most incredibly disappointing dining experience. i'm not sure if this restaurant has changed owners mgmt chef recently but the whole experience was awful. starting from the lobster bisque that tasted like beef, not anything like lobster and was luke warm. then the steaks were cooked perfectly, but tasted like pure salt blocks. the bearnaise sauce was cold and the fried onion garnish was ice cold and tasted stale. the manager came over to mansplain to us that in this restaurant, bearnaise sauce is always served cold and the onions were purely meant to be garnish. as such they are cooked earlier and served cold. in this case they were clearly cooked weeks ago. so poor all around. do not waste your time here. this used to be a gem, but sadly is now a dud."
2619,Christine K.,1111,1,9/23/17,"i really looked forward to my first time at this old new york establishment. unfortunately things did not go as planned for my partner and i the menus vary between a pub area and a more formal space, as does the ambience, evidently. the main dining room was half empty on a saturday night, and while you think that would make for a lucky coincidence and a quieter atmosphere, it was actually a little depressing. there were a lot of staff members standing around not doing much, so despite a dining area full of wait staff, the service was slow. the waiter assisting my partner and i said a few rude and dismissive words to us in response to a question we asked about the menu when we first arrived. ultimately, the poor service spoiled the night. we ordered an appetizer and then went to a different restaurant nearby. it is too bad it did not seem anything like the place that mark twain and abraham lincoln once enjoyed."
2620,Minjun K.,1111,1,5/9/17,"i would give stars for its exterior & interior view and services, but the food is way too salty for my appetite. even the grilled broccoli, which i expected to be light, was also very salty. if it was not salty, i would give stars for all of its food, service, and interior & exterior."
2621,D M.,1111,1,4/14/17,food was fine but was overlooked because the service was so bad and unattentive. waiter paid a lot more attention to the table next to us for some reason. did not even tell us the specials but he told the other table . i hate to think people are still racist in in nyc but i cannot think of another reason for this singled out treatment.
2622,Lukalvin P.,1111,1,11/12/16,no point. food are bland and waiter was rushing to have me sign off the tab! i would not recommend to dine here at all!
2623,Gustavo S.,1111,1,11/12/16,"simply in one word boring.forget all the words you would associate with a steakhouse like luxurious, decadent, rich.this place is more closer to boring, plain, flat, tasteless, bland. you are much better of eating on outback for a third of the price and triple the flavor.from the apps to the steak, to the desert nothing had a single bit of flavor. seems like everything is just cooked in water.the service is just ok, nothing over the top and i felt most of the time you are rushed to finish and leave.new york has some amazing steakhouses from the simples to the fancier, do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
2624,Tina Z.,1111,1,7/28/16,cannot recommend! salty food. service was not good at all either. not even once they check on us if we need anything. everything was very mediocre. i like the history of the place so one star for the history although we have museum for that i guess 
2625,Usman A.,1111,1,7/1/16,"do not get old fashioned ,they use house rye! make sure you specify which rye you want in it"
2626,Meredith Q.,1111,1,2/3/16,"my server who tall,white,young guy never attended my table. we waited over minutes after desert done. he just passed my table many times, and talked with other servers and laughing. in front of pos monitor, they just staying around there, talking and laughing. i had to call him for check. i have no idea with their service!! i felt like he does not care that much than other tables because we ordered restaurant week menu i really disappointed with that kind of service. if you want to look down your customers, do not add restaurant week menu please!!we are not cheap people and we just want to try your things in a chance. in the future, if i need to choose the fancy and delicious restaurant for big group it means big money for you guys, huh it will be not delmonico's.never come back! never recommend my friends also. one of guy who wearing black shirts, he was a only person who take care my table. i'm pretty sure that he is back server. i wanted to give tip him only. but i paid % tip also for your service. "
2627,Miss C.,1111,1,1/29/16,underwhelming. shrimp tastes like bleach. service awesome though. the wine list left a lot to be desired. i expected better from this place.
2628,Kim M.,1111,1,1/21/16,"what a disappointment. glorified cafeteria food. everything came out way too fast, food quality extremely sub par. overall our experience was not worth ever coming back for!"
2629,Dave E.,1111,1,1/7/16,very disappointing.the house delmonico was the fattiest steak i've ever been served in a high end steak house. service was outstanding though as should be expected at these prices. risotto was well prepared shrimp was excellent. all in all a good bucket list check off but will not be back
2630,Brad P.,1111,1,12/20/15,"possibly the worst i've ever spent. if i could give the restaurant stars i would certainly do it. the delmonico steak was over done and flavored like a sizzler special. it would barely rate as a ribeye. in fact, i would hesitantly give the steak to my maltipoo. i had to send the steak back after version number one was charred to a crisp, then then second version was barely better. the delmonico potatoes tasted like they were from a box. terrible. my wife characterized the restaurant perfectly. it is a new york staple that is famous, to a degree, and is kept in business by ignorant tourists i.e. me. you would be much better served at a chain morton's, ruth's chris, or flemings than this joint. if you have made reservations change them now."
2631,Bella B.,1111,1,9/16/15,went in to try out their bar only to be treated flippantly by the sullen almost irritable bartender. she obviously has aspirations of eventually heading to her true calling elsewhere since her flat personality and disdain for the clientele was palpable. will not be coming back here and do not recommend it.
2632,S. W.,1111,1,8/13/15,"beautiful restaurant! but stay away during restaurant week.upon checking in & glancing at the historic dining room, we were shuttled down to a musky, dank basement dining room where other restaurant week folks were.table setting upon seating, burgundy rimmed charger & wine glass laced with faint grease fingerprints.menu note upcharge items not worth orderingappetizer gulf shrimp risotto of us ordered this & presented with a consistently gooey, thick, microwaved warm glob of oatmeal consistency paste with one dull warm medium size shrimp. very unappetizing presentation.chef's chilled soup presentation gazpacho souptasted like tomatoes only & represented none of what this soup should have tasted like.wedge salad not served ice cold as it should be, other then that, its salad.delmonico's blue crabcake supplement made with ingredients that never merged nor added to the flavor of this single bite size crabcake.entrees grilled filet mignon w. chef's seasonal vegetable preparation of us ordered this. it was served on a small dollop of warm, dull, gooey pasted, mashed potato with luke warm tasteless string beans. the meat was ok, not sizzling hot when served and of us ate only the food.overnight barbecued short rib it tasted like it was left out overnight, my 'not' picky eater friend was so turned off, he did not finish this meal. meat was dry and rubbery. the description in menu sounded better than what was actually served.conclusion everything was served with a dull glazing over the meal, like it sat around for a long time before being served. no entrees were served piping hot. flies were circling our food.dessert dark chocolate mousse cake, salted caramel sauce ordered this & was eaten. tiny teaspoon of sauce provided, nothing impressive to rave of.classic baked alaskasupplement not worth it! this was horrible! of us ordered this warm plasticky tasting, burned meringue which overwhelmed the small piece of room temperature walnut cake & iced banana gelato. the ingredient combination did not merge well. we ate each item separately as each had a different texture & did not cut down smoothly with the fork. to their credit, the gelato was good, i rather it served alone. of this was left on the plate, no one wanted to eat this.new york style cheesecake, strawberry compote one ordered this. unlike description, it tasted like sour blackberry topping with no complexity nor spice, cheesecake was nothing remarkable.service nothing remarkable, the waiter gave us the bill before we asked & told us gratuities were already added, we never saw him again for any services afterwards.overall if restaurant week was meant to introduce restaurants in hopes of normal patronage, this one failed at its intent! for a grand, classy restaurant, food was subpar & not even worth . flies were a big turnoff as they laced our entrees & desserts. the smell of the basement was another turnoff. had our friends from out of town were not there, we would have made immediate complaints. the food, table setting, service and seating made it an embarrassing evening for us & we will never consider this restaurant for any occasion in the future. buyer be warned!"
2633,Katherine R.,1111,1,7/18/15,"beautiful place, amazing hostess but the worst service. the fact that you cannot accommodate your customers requests to order a burger in the main dining area and require them to move to the bar is completely unacceptable. i do understand if there are two different menus, but when you have a group that wants to order steaks, oysters and burgers there should be an exception. i looked forward to this dining experience and was appalled with the way the waiter treated my party. when we requested to speak with the manager we were told first he is having dinner with his family and does not want to be disturbed. seriously then go home and be with your family, there are plenty of hard working people in this city that would love your job."
2634,Will N.,1111,1,3/25/15,nothing wrong with the service. but the food is really quite pathetic. the feeling of the restaurant is of a hotel bar. it is gross and weak. my steak was flat and grey. go to harry's down the block.
2635,Keith W.,1111,1,1/22/15,"delmonico where to start. i was really underwhelmed. we expected a lot more from the waiters, service, and the food at such a high dollar and well known restaurant.the food oysters were fine, not the best, not the worst i've had. we both had steaks, one filet and one agebone in ribeye. the steaks were cooked well but the cut of beef was average at best. side note on my review i come from cattle country, so granted i may be a bit harsher critic than others, i know what a good steak should taste like.for a claimed day dry aged ribeye and day wet aged filet these were some very unflavorful cuts of meat. i suspect they do not age their own beef, as a high end restaurant should, they probably just buy it from a food vendor. the steaks were cooked properly, but for the price they are charging there is no excuse for this lack of taste.sides were not great, i would not recommend the asparagus or mashed potatos that we tried, both were below par.the service they never came by to cheek on the meal or to offer us additional drinks until the very end of the meal. very subpar. for a restaurant like this you should have at least two waiters, a lead and assistant checking on you, brushing crumbs off the table, folding your napkin when you leave your seat, and making sure your needs are met. instead the waitors felt content to talk with each other off in the corner and came by at the end of every course to see how it was. minutes after i get my steak, asking if it is cooked properly is unacceptable. letting us run out of bread unacceptable. letting our drinks run out, unacceptable. plus the other items i mentioned above.secondly, they are known for their wine selection. however, i was in a craft beer and cocktail mood. i asked the server for the beer list, which he recited to me. they all were lake and burger beers, budlight, coors, etc. perfect for burgers, but embarrassing they did not have a large selection of craft beers for a meal. asked him if he had any local beers, to which he replied blue moon. blue moon is made in colorado, not new york . then i asked for a moscow mule and if they had copper mugs. they did not have copper mugs, and he and his assistant did not know what a moscow mule even was. poor training of the wait staff on drinks, and poor craft beer selection. seems the staff were all there to collect a payday off the expensive food and lacked proper training.delmonico i expected much more of you."
2636,Jessica R.,1111,1,1/15/14,"this review is for the grill only.the woman bartender is waaaaay too aggressive for lunch time. there were maybe people at the bar, place was not busy at all and she was running around, like she was swamped. i was a bartender for a long time, she was just a mess. she never made eye contact and it took forever to get her attention. she seemed so high stung and nervous it made me uncomfortable to even enjoy myself there and relax. she was eating behind the bar and drinking wine. sorry, if you need to eat fine, but take a break and leave the bar, i do not need to see you shoving things in your mouth with your hands then handling my food. the only people she seemed to care about were the two alcoholics at the bar whom were gross and talking trash so loudly i had to move seats. she asked if i was ok when i moved and i said yea, it was just a little loud. her response well, it is a bar. do you want a table umm no rude, i can handle a loud bar just not a drunk, whom you keep pouring more and more wine for, slurring at the top of his lungs about really disgusting stuff. seriously, bad for business.the food was ok. started with the hand rolled mozzarella sticks. they were too doughy. then i had the cheesesteak. it was nothing to write home about. i came especially for it and i have no desire to get it again. the bread seemed stale, there was not enough onions and the meat did not have enough cheese. just an uneven ratio.it is disappointing because i really like the actual restaurant."
2637,Molls M.,1111,1,8/27/13,i've been here multiple times and usually it is very good however tonight was a major disappoitnment! if you are okay with your waitress doing multiple shots throughout the night which you can clearly witness. much less the gm also drinking and stumbling around dinking and turning the music louder and louder to a point where i was begging the waitress to bring us the check however she was so wasted to took awhile. all that said when our steak came out it was smothered with an awful homemade a sauce that was not listed on the menu. i do not know about you but when my dollar steak comes out with an unadvertised sweet awful bbq sauce on it i am disappointed to say the least. if you are a true steak enthusiast then i do not recommend you go here. which is a true shame since this establishment used to be the best steak house in manhattan. not anymore.
2638,Anne R.,1111,1,7/18/13,"our meal and our dining experience were totally ruined by one of your longerterm waiters.on june , we made an email reservation to dine at delmonico's on june for pm at beaver st., ny.as this was our first time at delmonicos, we asked the waiter to suggest a wine he refused. but his reply was, you have a wine list, choose for yourself . obviously, his reply did not sit very well with me. however, because i was entertaining my wife and a guest, i did not address the waiter's arrogance.we then ordered appetizers. however it took forever to arrive since his main focus was on another table and completely ignoring us. when we ordered the main course, and the steak dinner arrived, one mediumwell steaks was extremely rare and rubbery. so we asked the waiter to please provide my guest with the steak as ordered. but to our surprise, your waiter created such a loud spectacle that the rest of the restaurant patrons had no choice but to hear and stare at us. however, because it was supposed to be a special occasion for my wife and my guest, i kept my composure to not make more of a scene.while my guest waited for his proper dinner, and as all good hosts do, both my wife and i waited for our guest's food to arrive . needless to say, while waiting our guest's food, our own food got extremely cold. and when eventually, the waiter came back with my guest's steak, not only did it turn out to be the same steak that was rubbery and undercooked, but this time the steak was completely overcooked and charburned at the bottom. because i was hosting this dinner, i called for the manager to express our concerns. and while he listened deducted the price of the three steaks, his attitude was one of arrogance and indifference. it is as though he has been there far too long to provide good service. in fact, his demeanour expressed that he could care less about delmonicos and the patrons experience. and if both waiter and manager were my employees and i run a court building operation , they both would have been shown the door.in your handout it states that you are attempting to rebuild the delmonico brand once again. and while this is laudable, you may want to make it a priority to instruct and educate both waiters and managers on proper customer service and etiquette. after all, is that not the reason that delmonicos is in business, and the staff is there to provide professional service and give the patrons a good delmonico experience in fact, if you do not address this problem, delmonicos will most certainly lose more patrons.we are from toronto, canada. and when my wife made this reservation, it was meant to be a particularly special celebration because she has cancer . however, our delmonico experience turned out to be a complete disaster. not only was cutlery missing and we had to ask several times not only was service absent and not there not only were we neglected as patrons not only was the food deficient not only were we insulted when presented with the meal check, but more importantly, we were all embarrassed beyond what any words could ever express by your staff.we set at table our check number was the waiter i can only identify as tall, old with an accent and wearing his glasses on his forehead stipe g and the manager ."
2639,Saffi S.,1111,1,7/11/13,worst bartender blond one look like russian terrible rude service! skip this place!
2640,Kate L.,1111,1,5/11/13,"i knew the moment i glanced into the dining room and saw the frumpy, fat midwestern clientele i would made a mistake. no matter. my suspicions were confirmed upon my first bite of the wedge salad. i do not know how this is possible but they managed to take a foolproof salad and turn into a bitter rubbery garbage heap. the lettuce was tough and bitter, the bacon were so incinerated as to be tasteless, the the tomatoes were watery like a bad taco bell garni, and the blue cheese was was overpoweringly astringent and sharp, so much so that it burned my gum line. the salad was accompanied by some cold parbaked bread rolls and some oversalted butter. the delmonicos streak was truly demonic a huge mass of yellowed fat and membranes. this was priced at dollars. i've never had such a fatty, overpriced cut of meat at a place purporting to be a steakhouse. truly terrible. the side order of mushrooms were rubbery and overwhelmed by a seasoning that tasted like it been lifted from the stoeffers stuffing mix. the local greens with garlic and lemon were drowned in lemon juice, rendering them indelible. my brother's chicken a la keene tasted like a delta airlines entree from the 's. needless to say we skipped dessert. come here if you enjoy a good tourist trap and want to spend + dollars per person for poorquality food in a stuffy, dated environment. the servers were at least attentive. our waiter insisted we doggybag our sides, huffily proclaiming them delicious! "
2641,Nathan B.,1111,1,4/14/13,"i ate at the bar, the two bartenders barely knew i existed. it took minutes to get a drink, for my check. they were not that busy they just are not very good at handling a rush. the one big party was getting their check when i sat down. then the one bartender complained about my being upset with her lousy service. never again."
2642,Brice P.,1111,1,3/22/13,"do not even think about doing delivery!you will think, hey, i live a few blocks from delmonico's. maybe i will just skip the walk and order in. i will watch some march madness and enjoy great food. you will order your food and say, 'hey! minutes for delivery that is great. your food will arrive an hour after you order. ok, its delmonico's. its worth it. your food will feel lukewarm. hmpf. if you order the sweet and spicy chicken, your bread will be soaked in some sort of mayo or juices. when you try to lift your sandwich, chicken will fall out and leave you holding your soaked piece of bread. look for some bread that is not soaking wet. chew it. it will be like trying to chew a tire.move on the to the chicken. one bite and you will know it is from delm. the rubber chicken factory. no taste. no spicy or sweet. no juices. it will taste like dried chicken. the french fries had more spice and taste going for them."
2643,S. R.,1111,1,1/19/13,"what a horrible experience! i arrived minutes late to meet my boss and her friend, and the hostess told me that i was the first person in my party to arrive. i thought it was odd, but i waited for awhile. i asked again in about minutes and was told that my boss's friend had called and she was running late. so, i waited another half hour, then another host finally agreed to seat me. as i was following him through the dining room, my boss jumped up from a table. she had been there the whole time!now, a word about the hostess. she was wearing skintight stretch white jeggings, a top practically cut down to her belly button, and incredibly high hootchiemama heels. to call her outfit inappropriate would be an understatement. of course, the servers were falling over themselves to cluster around her any free moment they got. it would be easier to overlook her error about my party if she had presented herself more respectably and looked like she had something to do besides make the males drool.then, the waiter was another story. i know new yorkers like to cultivate a special brand of rudeness, but he was hostile. he flat out refused to check into a question that my colleague had for the kitchen. then, i think he overheard us discussing his attitude, and he glared at me from across the dining room. then he never came back another server took over.we were not a difficult party. we are four welleducated professionals who were trying to have a nice meal. in a city with so many choices, you would think that this restaurant would try to provide a quality dining experience. just because you have been around for a long time, does not mean that you cannot fail.finally, all i can say about the food was that it was fine. not great, just okay. if the food had been amazing, maybe the service problems could have been overlooked. i will not only never return to this restaurant, but it will become one of my mostrepeated bad restaurant experiences ever.the manager should reconsider his frontofhouse and service staff."
2644,L P.,1111,1,12/2/12,"as steak lovers, my wife and i we were very excited when we saw a groupon for delmonico's especially because there were no menu restrictions. however, our experience was horrible. we were treated like secondclass citizens.our three courses arrived one of top of the other even though there was no wait and the restaurant was not full. we were being served at a literally sickening pace. the appetizers were ok. the steak, while cooked perfectly, was no better than you would expect at a casual dining restaurant. the only positives were the au poivre sauce and the sides brussel sprouts and fries . dessert i had the baked alaska was disgusting. we were never even offered a second drink.the kicker a % gratuity added to the bill."
2645,AJ W.,1111,1,9/16/12,"went there on a groupon which said i had the run of the menu. but when i ordered the pound steak that cost they told me it was for two. it did not say on the menu it was for two. delmonico's has a racist, discriminatory seating policy. we got there early and the place was empty. since most of the clientele are young white males with their blonde girlfriends and i am an old jewish alter cocker and my wife asian we were seated in an area where the couples were blacks with whites that was near the kitchen. all you could hear was the clang of silverware. of course i asked for another table and we were seated in a small backroom with better chairs but not in the main dining room. when they tried to seat a older white couple there they declined and were told they could get a table for two in the main dining room in minutes. the club has no such seating policy. if anyone else experienced the same thing please contact me via yelp or facebook. i do not believe in suing anyone as i do not believe in the civil judicial system in new york but you might want to consider this."
2646,Richard K.,1111,1,8/5/12,"steakhouse.in the city. can be that badd, right food got the gazpacho for the first time, a light cold soup. it was quite refreshing. as an entr ] c e, i decided to go with the classic delmonico steak. it was in between your typical good quality steak and the kind you get at applebee's. so therefore, nothing amazing but definitely beats your tgifriday, outback and applebee's. for dessert, i regretfully chose the cheesecakes. as a fan it cheesecake.it sucked!! texture and flavor were way off.service they had a section in the lower level of their building so my group and i received a table once everyone got there. we ordered our drinks and food expecting some good service like in any other restaurant. got our appetizers right away, so one star for them. good for them. unfortunately their service could not hold up. basically everything went downhill from here, the service mixed up our orders, had to wait for min to get a waiter to fix it, another for them to get it right, waiter only asked half the table if everything was alright, waiter never came around again to check on us so i was not able to get my steak sauce till i finished half of my steak, and finally when asked to get the bill. it took us two ties and minutes till we finally got it because no waiters were around half the we are there. actually i see them behind the curtains in the kitchen eating the same cheesecake they serve to us.just scarfing them down.i could continue to go on about the ambience.but why bother. i would not recommend nor go to this place myself in the future. the star applies only to their steak, like stood out and shined from everything else "
2647,Zachary B.,1111,1,7/24/12,"despite our excitement to try out delmonico's steakhouse, we were terribly disappointed in our experience because the service was so appalling.we had courses at delmonico's. our first course came out almost immediately after we ordered. we finished the course and ended up waiting an extraordinary long time for our second course to come out. when we were about finished our main course i noticed our waiter bring out our desert course and set it on an empty table on the restaurant floor, where it stayed until we were done our entrees. our deserts were out in the open, being hovered over by the wait staff and whoever decided to walk by the table. i could not believe it, i've never seen a restaurant do that before. when we got our desserts they were warm and stale.beyond the timing in the courses our waiter had a general disregard for our table the whole meal. he threw our silverware on the table in between courses, instead of placing it down with concern and care about what he was doing. our waiter never came over to ask us how our meal was once our entr ] c e had been dropped. finally, our waiter decided to completely ignore our request on how to divide the check when we handed him credit cards, and instead simply split the bill down the middle.service that awful does not happen often, and i did not expect it from delmonico's."

2649,Kiran S.,1112,4,7/26/18,"pretty good food! we had the grilled pineapple avocado salad, chicken savanna, and chicken burrito bowl. we also got nachos, which were so unique and different play on normal, traditional nachos really good! the salad and the chicken savanna were great, the burrito bowl is a pass for me. good experience, but it is definitely a bit overpriced."
2650,Davaish S.,1112,5,7/19/17,great staff and fun place! food is always consistent and drinks are good. prices are reasonable and the guac and cheese dip is good. try the fish tacos and make sure you get a big margarita!
2651,Jillian L.,1112,4,6/20/17,"it is been a while since i had some good margs and mexican food. mad dog & beans totally hit the spot!this may be my new summer spot for margaritas! they have a ton of fruity flavors and they give you an option between frozen and on the rocks. the frozen margs are where it is at! the consistency is very smooth and not icy at all. they use fresh fruit purees to make their flavorings. i tried the frozen mango, frozen blood orange, strawberry on the rocks, and blackberry cucumber on the rocks. our server was nice enough to mix the two flavors for us. out of all, the blood orange frozen marg was my favorite.for food, we ordered the following large guacamole the guac was my favorite of the night! i think that i make a good guac, but i think mad dog may make a slightly better one.mexican corn perfectly charred and smothered in mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder. it comes on a stick for easy eating. i'm always a sucker for anything with mayo and cotija.chicken chimichangas my expectations for chicken chimichangas are low. i've had too many overly fried chimichangas stuffed with dry, flavorless shredded chicken. the chicken chimichangas at mad dog are nicely fried and filled with moist, tasty chicken and lots of cheese.churros w chocolate dipping sauce the only way to cap off the night. enough said.overall, mad dog & beans is a great place for mexican food! the food and drinks are on point and the staff is super friendly! looking forward to coming back soon!"
2652,Ricky V.,1112,4,7/22/18,"great happy hour spot in fidi. very nice service and the ambience is always very nice. food is normal, nothing to get too excited about but is acceptable. guacamole and nachos are really good though. recommended."
2653,Devon R.,1112,4,8/6/18,cute spot. sangria was very tasty. we had a great server that was friendly and attentive. host could have been nicer but maybe she was having an off day. would stop by again when in the area.
2654,Aysha S.,1112,4,7/1/17,"ah.mad dog will always have a special place, near and dear to my heart. this is where i came when i got my job offer right after graduating college. their margaritas are delightful happy hour only occurs at the bar downstairs and their guacamole is great. you can choose the spice level and it comes in a really coollooking stone chiseled bowl. now the summer has dawned on us, i will be back on stone street, and i will be back at mad dog.knocking off one star because the wait staff can be inattentive and rude at times. but i've been here a bunch of times and they can be real sweet so it can be a hit or miss.regardless i recommend it!"
2655,Brian G.,1112,4,3/24/18,"ok, so the check in offer was great. saves % on a marg. who can say no to that the margs were great to boot. however, their quesadillas were a bit disappointing for my taste. not as much cheese as i was expecting for the size. i need the oily goodness to satisfy my hungover state on an saturday early afternoon!i got a little annoyed with the fact that i got a pretty decent sized splinter in my left thigh when i hopped back onto the high chair. my jeans did rip a bit too . the management reached out to me to make things right and honestly that is all i needed since i know there is too many things to handle in the restaurant biz.i greatly respect management that makes an effort and you guys have killer drinks too so i will definitely be back here just please sand the seats so i do not get one in my buttcheek next time lol."
2656,Phyllis N.,1112,4,3/21/18,"they have the best guacamole ever! my friend and i could not have enough of it. we ordered two frozen margaritas, tacos de cerdo and a grilled pineapples avocado salad. the tacos de cerdo came with beans and rice. the salad was okay. it came with a red sauce, which was spicy. it is a nice place to hangout with friends and enjoy latin music. their music choices do not disappoint."
2657,Bel H.,1112,5,7/17/18,"mad dog has some good food, but the stars are mostly for the great staff. i have been here over the years and have seen a few changes, but the customer service has always been % satisfactory shoutout to the top floor . i recommend the basics like their chips and guac, quesadillas, and the tacos. as for drinks, definitely make sure to try their cucumber margarita! it is amazing!"
2658,Amy R.,1112,5,4/12/18,"great margaritas!!!i have come here many times for happy hour after work, almost every friday. i have sat inside as well as outside on stone street in the summers. their margaritas are tasty and amazing, very strong!! you can also get a different type of tequila shot.the food is great as well, i've had almost all their food from the menu since i come here so often for the last years!! the guacamole at maddog is the best in nyc! the service is great no complaint at all. my favorite waiter is felix ramirez, professional, attentive and know his job, which for me is important! my favorite place and all is really really good! i highly recommend this place!!"
2659,Erick S.,1112,5,6/24/17,"one of the best mexican places in the area. . food stars.best margaritas and tacos in the area. the beef tacos come with guacamole and a side of rice and beans that do not disappoint to say the least. . ambience stars.the great selection of spanish music, low lighting, and casual ambience combine to make this establishment a good choice to spend happy hour or weekend hangout. . staff stars.this is the only reason why i think this restaurant does not deserve stars. i'm a regular in this place and never has a host greeted me at the entrance. i've always had to look for the host to seat us, instead of the other way around. more attentive staff would go a long way to make this place a star establishment.overall great ambience and food. you will enjoy visiting this place!"
2660,Emily D.,1112,5,4/24/17,"i've been meaning to write a review for mad dog for some time now. i've been here numerous times with my friends and each time has been amazing. their margaritas here are a must! my favorite flavor is the blood orange but i've tried almost all of them by now. i would say if you are coming here with a bunch of people and drinking get one of their margarita towers, it deff pays out in the long run.my go to order here is the chicken enchiladas in their green sauce. also their guac is a must, i love how you can decide how spicy you want it. i've only eaten inside, they have an upstairs and downstairs dining area. i'm excited to come by in the summer so i can sit out on stone street! love this place one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the city and would deff recommend it for anyone looking for a good time and good food drinks."
2661,Dominik D.,1112,4,1/13/18,"really crowded if you come on a friday night, which will effect the speed of waiters waitresses. however, my burrito and rice and beans were well prepared and came out in a fair amount of time."
2662,Allison P.,1112,5,5/4/18,kelli was great!! me and my sister stopped in for a margarita. try the mango or the raspberry. they were so good we came back later the same day.
2663,Melissa D.,1112,5,2/16/18,the food here is really good. as expected it was crowded but our food came out quickly and the drinks were nice and strong!!
2664,Courtney M.,1112,5,7/11/18,"great service and food! to be located in the financial district, they have reasonable prices!"
2665,Cara B.,1112,5,6/14/16,"hands down might be the best margaritas and chicken enchiladas i've ever had! so impressed with the food here i will definitely be coming back.i also had the guacamole as a starter and it was delicious. for my entree i had the pollo enchiladas which came with rice and beans. the enchiladas were covered in a verde sauce which was to die for. needless to say i cleaned my plate!for drinks, my friends and i first ordered a pitcher of blood orange margaritas on the rocks. i'm not a big margarita lover but these were so good i could not resist. the pitcher is a good size. there were people and we each had at least margaritas each out of the pitcher. we then tried just the classic margarita on the rocks and they were just as good.i cannot wait to go back. it may be a little pricey but it definitely worth it!!!next time i am going to sit outside on stone street. this place is great all around."
2666,Christopher S.,1112,3,5/30/17,"while the location is a+ right in the thick of stone street the food was just ok. we started with the guacamole and mexican street corn which were both good, although nothing to write home about. we then went with an order of the cheese and chicken quesadilla's which were somewhat lacking in flavor, with not much too them. perhaps we did not order the right things. the food is priced fairly however, especially since you are in an excellent location.on the plus side, the margarita's were excellent and there were some happy hour deals available. definitely stop by for some after work drinks."
2667,Jon W.,1112,4,5/8/16,"great mexican food, margaritas, and servicei went here on a saturday night for dinner and was able to get a table pretty quickly. when you walk in you will notice loud pop music playing and large bar with a bunch of high tables. you feel like you are walking into a fiesta!we were greeted by a nice waitress and ordered the chips and salsa a surprise to me since most mexican restaurants come with chips and salsa. we also split the big margarita and got the mango flavor in it with the chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos. the margarita was made perfectly and the chicken enchiladas were so good with the sweet green sauce on top and the tacos were really good too and good portions.in short great margaritas good food with good portions friendly wait staff"
2668,Dao L.,1112,5,6/20/17,"went here for yelp event. the food and service were on point!we were served mild guac and chips. the guac contained more tomatoes than i usually liked mine but the ratio kinda worked. it was delicious. the guac came in a large shallow bowl so it was misleading on the amount of guac. do not dip too much guac per chip lol. . also had, a strawberry, mango, and electric blue frozen margaritas with salt. yes, i am an alcoholic . the margaritas as well prepared as there is good amount of alcohol in them. i got tipsy on my first drink but i am also a light weight asian. next thing we had were grill corn with cheese. and o m g, it was so good. i inhaled the corn in less than a minute. the corns were prepared well, it contained all the moisture and the sweet juice from the corn goes well with the hint of spice they throw on it. highly recommend.later came the chicken chimichangas. it was good but nothing special. lastly, we had the churros with some strawberrys.now, i always get my churros from some random lady in subway station for . so that is what i compared it too. the churros in this place is undersized and a bit too hard in texture compared to the subway churros. the service ."
2669,Matthew R.,1112,3,6/17/17,"stopped in for some guac and margaritas. we went with a large guac which was good size and pretty delicious. we also had blood orange margaritas which were pretty good. the restaurant feels pretty corporate, like a more hip chili's. not sure if i would actually come back for more than guac and margaritas but i's not a bad spot to start the night."
2670,Sara L.,1112,4,1/5/18,"cool spot. i like the bar and ambiance. the margaritas are really good and strong! food is alright, i just like to get drinks and appetizers. guacamole is the best and the quest function is good too. for dessert the best fried ice cream. good spot for drinks"
2671,Courtney T.,1112,5,2/3/18,"have come here for lunch many, many times and have never been disappointed. despite the heavy crowds, the food and service is never impacted. i highly recommend, however, making a reservation as it is often a very long wait during lunch hours. if you are looking for a quiet spot, you may want to pass. but if you are looking for quality mexican food and a fun atmosphere, i suggest stopping in."
2672,Anissa C.,1112,5,8/7/16,"i'm obsessed with this place. i'm familiar with the neighborhood, as i went to high school and worked in the area.it is truly a gem. the vibe is always right, and the staff is competent and helpful.the menu is pretty traditional and accurate. the food is phenomenal. my favorite thing to order here are the steak tacos. the tacos come with rice and refried beansit is the perfect meal. i would totally recommend that meal.also, their margaritas are bangin'!!!! you cannot order a frozen margarita everywhere. in my experience, they are usually slushy, watery, and tasteless most places, but theirs are a ! to die for.happy hour mondaythursday, and their brunch, which i have yet to try, is on the weekends! come through."
2673,Chris E.,1112,4,7/27/15,"perfectly situated in the heart of the stone street drinking scene. the restaurant is pretty big with floors and outdoor seating. the happy hour, which consists of sangria and mexican beers, lasts until pm so get your drinking in early!since this restaurant is so big, it can easily accomodate large parties, which we happened to have. we had a party of about people and they promptly seated us upstairs. we ordered quite a few entrees of quesadillas and nachos with guacamole. the food went perfectly with the alcohol and although my mental state might have been altered , i thought the food was very good. be prepared to do some shouting though as the place was loud and the service was fast!"
2674,Nicole S.,1112,4,11/12/17,"i came here with a group of friends for dinner. we ordered a bunch of food including chips and guac, nachos, quesadillas, and pitcher of margherita to split. everything was very good. prices here are a bit on the higher end for a night out, but still reasonable."
2675,Gen W.,1112,4,4/16/17,"i really enjoyed this place. they have great service and are a great place for groups. this place gets packed on the weekends and there are a bunch of fun places to wander to after. they have great guacamole. i was a little bummed about the size of their blended margarita, as it came in a small water glass. at a minimum, i would have expected the margarita in a proper margarita glass. the environment and selection of food was solid!"
2676,Ray H.,1112,5,9/17/16,"first look at this place and you can tell it is fun. coming here on a friday evening was a really good choice. besides the amazing drinks and vibe, there were amazing people there. everyone there was all about having fun and making friends.the drinks were really good, and on top of that the bartenders were as well. mingling and having the occasional shot with customers makes the experience that much better."
2677,Mia O.,1112,5,3/20/17,"this is my goto spot for margaritas near work essential. great guacamole and other food items. a bit pricey but worth it. service can be a bit slow because this place is usually packed, so just be prepared. i like sitting at the bar, or upstairs for more privacy. really nothing can beat the outdoor seating on stone street which is heated when it is chilly outside. so lovely and fun!"
2678,Amanda M.,1112,4,11/6/17,"i always have a fabulous experience here when i sit with amanda, the bartender! she is quick and friendly.a true professional! margaritas are awesome too! food is ok."
2679,Ram K.,1112,1,5/18/17,"went here for lunch on a week day. when we went the place was half full.absolutely cold service. no greetings smiles what so ever. a robot could have done a better job.we ordered a mojito, guac, tacos and chicken fajitas.mojito no alcohol. simple syrup and lime juice may be.guac very goodtacos avgthe server was very rude. when picking up plates, they dropped guac on my shirt leaving a huge stain. he did not even care to see that or say sorry. i understand everyone makes mistakes. but see that and say that. the waitress saw that they dropped guac on my shirt and she did not even care to utter a word! absolutely horrible!!so for a lunch check i get mojito without alcohol, avg tacos and a huge stain on my nice shirt.i am always on the side of servers when they some mishap happens. but the fact that they remained silent even after seeing what happened was the absolute worst. i am never going back."
2680,Angie M.,1112,1,9/19/17,"i've had my last horrible experience here. i only order from here because i can order guac without onions. the other food i've had is not that great. i find it weird to eat the chicken enchiladas with cubes of chicken instead of shredded chicken. and today, i'm glad i went the whole way back to the restaurant to pick up my guac, because the tortilla soup was awful and i threw it out after two bites. i've never tasted anything so bland and weird. plus both the cheese and the chicken were in cubes. it was just strange.today's experience started off badly because they did not get the order from grubhub. ok. understandable. but then i was asked to reorder. what so i'm to get charged twice because you cannot retrieve an order no! one of the girls was nice and took my phone and put the order in from there. so i got my order, walked back to my office, open the bag, and only half of my order was in there. then i call to let them know, and the guy on the phone decides to give an obviously angry customer a hard time. i mention what happened, and he kept mentioning sending it out to me via delivery well, i kept correcting him to tell him it is pick up. so he says i'm trying to correct it if you would stop talking over me. hey how about listening to your customer from the beginning instead of escalating their irritation!! so then he insists on getting my address, and i asked why he says he is going to have it delivered. i said, yet again, it is for pick up. he assumed that delivery would be an easier option and was getting angry with me because i kept requesting pick up. something is wrong with this guy. this place does not know much about customer service, and especially at a busy lunch hour.i've had other irritating service from here previously, and the food is not worth it. not in the least bit."
2681,Omayra P.,1112,2,4/27/17,"i decided to go into this place because they were giving out free don julio shots. the only thing i did not like was that happy hour ended at pm which is too early. so i ordered the chicken flautas and a frozen mango margarita. the flautas were filled with potatoes inside of chicken, i was disappointed because that is false advertisement. i then ordered a frozen coconut margarita and the flavor was not that much different. i feel that the liquor content was barely in the margarita. i did not even get a buzz."
2682,Allie O.,1112,5,1/20/18,"liked this place a lot. it was really busy on a friday night but service was so great, friendly and quick! food was delicious . i had the chicken enchiladas and we ordered their guacamole for the table, would definitely go back."
2683,Micaela S.,1112,1,11/4/17,"the manager of this restaurant, jaffar hamad, failed to protect me and my friends from a family who verbally assaulted us during our dinner. they threatened to assault my friend in the bathroom where there were no the manager refused to ask them to leave. action was taken after they pulled the hostesses hair and a brawl began. we called the police, fearing for our lives, and the manager did not even care. the manager still expected us to pay for a dinner we were too scared to have eaten. he put our lives in peril and his own staff in peril and felt no remorse for the situation that ensued. i will not be returning, and i urge those reading this to grab drinks elsewhere because you are not safe in this bar."
2684,Nikki G.,1112,4,7/7/17,went here for sunday brunch while staying nearby at the recommendation of a bartender we me the day before. we sat out back on the cute stone street area and had a delicious brunch and margarita special. the chips and guacamole were the best. i need to come back next time i visit.my only warning is that service was a bit slow so if you are in a rush maybe rethink going at a busy time but still was really good.
2685,Alex S.,1112,4,3/13/17,one of the best mexican spots on stone street. they have excellent margaritas and food. me and my friend shared the queso fundito and i decided to go with the enchiladas for my main. always enjoy this place
2686,Shanta B.,1112,4,8/30/17,cute indoor outdoor place especially if you are a fan of mexican food! the jalapeno margarita is a must! especially if you love it extra spicy!
2687,Donato G.,1112,3,6/13/18,"we came on a friday evening, and this place was packed. we waited about an hour to be seated. once we were finally seated, the service was excellent. fun atmosphere and a great place to grab drinks. however, the food is mediocre. i would suggest coming here during happy hour or just to grab drinks, but not for an authentic mexican meal."
2688,Margaret L.,1112,1,9/22/18,"do not go here! if i could give them a zero star rating, i would! my bf and i wanted to try a new mexican place since we always order from a diff spot and we figured we would try mad dog since we live a block away. we placed an order for delivery over two hours ago, and i called to follow up. they said that the kitchen was busy and backed up, and i should cancel my order. she was not apologetic whatsoever, and they have awful customer service. i was reluctant to try them out due to the poor reviews, but they are all true. do not go here!"
2689,Kisa R.,1112,1,8/22/18,"i came here with my coworker for late dinner. i had two red sangria which were ok at best. the rice n beans were bland no seasoning. the chicken wings were okay as well. i had the chimichangas which was okay however, my colleague had steak nachos which she said was less than desirable. she reported instantly getting a tummy ache after the first few bites. the waiter took it back but, were both less than impressed with the food here. not sure i will return to this establishment."
2690,J I.,1112,1,8/20/18,"it all started with the rude nasty server who was irritated because the restaurant was crowded. we ordered a margarita tower, she left without letting us pick a flavor for it. we flagged her down and she rushed us to pick one before it was made, even though it was her fault for leaving in the middle of our order.she swiped my card at least three times because my bank cut it off, and locked my account. she brought me back four recipts that said declined as i had my bank app open, looking at my money, in my account. i assume my account was locked after she swiped it so many times. we asked for an atm and she it was two clubs down. we said we would go and she requested we leave something as collateral, so i left my phone. my friend and i went to the atm while my other friend stayed. she was followed around the restaurant and cursed and berated by the server we had. she said we were skipping out on our bill, she called her names, and called us broke. honestly after leaving my brand new phone. i'm not sure why we would leave without paying for something as simple as chips and guacamole and a margarita.my account was still locked thanks to the amazing server who overswiped my card, so my bank only allowed me to withdraw .my other friend ended up covering the bill so the server would stop harassing us, and i just apple paid it to her, since i could not use my card.this was by far the worst experience i have ever had at a mad dog restaurant. ever. horrible disgusting staff."
2691,Rachelle O.,1112,1,5/29/18,"the food was way overpriced, dollars for chips and salsa! the food was no better than chipotle but double the price. the rice was bland and the beans tasted like black licorice. not worth the money."
2692,Jackie O.,1112,1,4/12/18,"i must say i've gone here over a dozen times in the last two years that i have lived on wall street. i love the food here! i live one street away, and i'm sad to say that i came here on tues. and got awful service. we ordered margaritas, guac, and two burritos and my server was no where to be seen for an hour. this was the second time i received bad service. i've worked in the device industry as a hostess, busser, server, and bartender in privately owned and corporate establishments.today i came in with a party of hoping to get a table sometime soon. at i received a text saying we were on the list for dinner. we were told about a min wait. i called at pm to check on our table, i was told i could have a table for and they could add a chair or we can wait longer. my brother and his fianc ] c came here from virginia so i said i would wait for the table of . it is pm officially hours after we put my phone number down for a table of and still no text.i'm beyond embarrassed that i recommended this place to my family. i'm extremely embarrassed that i thought we would have gotten a table here. it is pm and we are finally eating dinner. i will most certainly never go to this restaurant or recommend it again. we ended up eating at beckett's, which had a wonderful bartender, good food, and no wait!!!"
2693,Annie R.,1112,1,3/23/18,"came here, was told it would be hours to wait. we said that was fine, we got a text back in minutes so we walked back to just wait another hour. after an hour we asked how much longer because it had been minutes since we got the text the table was ready and their system said we had already been seated and that is why they had not come to find us so they said that regardless we were going to be seated next. we were fine with that, but then another goes by and we watch others get seated and we do not. we gave up and left. bad customer service."
2694,Alicia N.,1112,1,2/1/18,i will not be returning! one of the waiters coughed in his hand then picked up silverware and plates and set one of the tables! gross and disgusting!! sorry you lost a customer
2695,Jackie H.,1112,1,1/13/18,"tldr check footage in its entirety and do not forget to check the frames make reference to those that may reveal more of the whole truth and not just those that bolster your onesided argument.christina,yes, i hope we could all view that footage. did it show my hair fall into the dish did you see that did you take the hair and do a dna test unless you do, i do not believe some flimsy circumstantial evidence nor some footage could show the whole truth.also, did the footage show my male friend with short hair pull hair out of his rice and beans he was seated diagonal from me. i was not sitting anywhere near his food nor was i flipping it into his food. please take a look at the camera again on afternoon where both my male friend and i found a hair in our own separate dishes. he pulled it out of his rice and beans he said it was deeply embedded inside and placed his on a plate and i placed mine on a napkin. also, why does it matter if it is found while he is eating or found right before he digs in are you choosing to only take responsibility for hair that falls into food right before it is served on the surface of his plate garnish !! and denying responsibility for hair that may have fallen in while it was cooking washed any stage of the preparation process hence why it was inside the food on , after finding it in his rice and beans, he placed it onto a red or orange side plate. check the video again, but either you or the waitress saw him pick it from the orange or red side plate to show them. if you actually watched the footage or had a good enough camera, you would have witnessed this. i found mine in my eggs of the huevos rancheros and placed mine on a napkin and by the time we called over a server and you later came out, i went looking in my napkin and did not find mine. so, you actually picked up hair his and not mine if you want to argue that. check the footage on to see me pull it out of my eggs in the huevos rancheros so glad you have the footage actually . please find that moment that i see it and put into my napkin. my napkin was to the left of me i remember and his plate was red or orange according to my recollection. also, this is not relevant but you mentioned it, and i understand as the restaurant lighting is not the best, but i never cut my hair or changed the length in the last months. i am also fully asian so my people's hair is actually naturally very, very jet black and i have some highlights but i would not call it brown . until we do a dna test, it is very funny you keep saying it is my long brown hair that we keep finding in dishes over the course of the two visits.to be fair, not all your servers hostesses had long hair that was tied back. i also cannot see inside your kitchen staff and your servers hostesses because sadly i do not have video footage of that it would be creepy if i did and i commend you for looking through your footage for these details, but please do a better job re incident .while you are at it, please check footage re last sunday. i was disgusted and opening my mouth in shock as i was embarrassed in front of my guests and was uncomfortable since this happened to me before. no one in their right mind laughs when finding hair in their food. also, you are right. i do give businesses a chance. it is why i returned time and time again.i eat out multiple times a week with and without my beloved hats on because of the freezing ny weather lately and although i do touch my hair each time, i've never found hair in any of my plates of food for lunch, dinner, happy hour, or any other brunch place in the east village or in fidi. somehow, my hair always likes to fallout of its hatwhen i am here. not saying it is impossible for hair to fall out when a hat is on, but it is less prone to.also, please feel welcome to comment back on my reviews as i take no offense at all. i am not here to arguethis is not my goal. i simply want to communicate and avoiding my comments and choosing not to respond does not make you look better nor me worse. so no one here is embarrassed if that helps you sleep better tonight.regarding the tip, i wanted to pay a tip proportional to the entire meal but you gave us a bill that had one small charge and resembled a bill of someone else's. why, of course, we were confused. i brought it to your attention simply asking for the bill that reflected our meal's entire cost so that i can give a better tip, i was met with a snicker and a face of annoyance. after that, i was done."
2696,Erin L.,1112,1,12/30/17,would never return. we are all sitting here still dumbfounded that this place is serving this quality of food. the soup tasted like a minestrone makeover mess. the quesadillas were weak. the enchiladas were so weak. the beans were awful. the guac was and so so bland. and they messed up my blended margarita. it tasted like a chemical problem.four us came in mega hungry and excited and left still hungry because we could not finish the trash that was in front of us.not worth the cost and not worth the doors being open to this place.again. never coming back. guys. beware!
2697,Lorena G.,1112,1,11/5/17,i just watched a manager tell a customer say i do not care if you die at my restaurant. that is not my problem. also then some family got rowdy and a member of it attacked the hodges's. dinner and a show! star for good guac though
2698,Carina P.,1112,1,10/29/17,"i love margaritas and was very excited to come here. we could not sit at a table inside because the hostess was adamant you had to have a reservation or go through the hostess even though some tables were empty.the margarita was and i was craving a margarita. i was served the most disgusting margarita i've had in awhile. if you get anna, the tall blonde bartender, run in the opposite direction. she was very rude. when i asked for her to remake my drink she gave me attitude and said, i cannot help you hun . extremely condescending. i had to ultimately ask the manager for the margarita to be remade.the manager brought the drink back to anna and she made it just as bad probably just to be spiteful. horrible place. there are other bars on stone street worth your money and time, this one is not."
2699,T. H.,1112,1,10/21/17,"terrible service and mediocre food. this place is in such a great street, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!!!"
2700,Marie S.,1112,1,10/6/17,"food and margaritas here are decent, but stay away if you value your time or your credit card security. have literally never had a good experience here. last few times i've been took a client here for lunch and she was a little late getting off the subway so we arrived literally min after our reservation time, evidently you lose your lunch reso after min ok, way too strict but fine , we got bumped to the back of the line including walkins not fine and had to wait min so had only min for lunch awkward made a lunch reso for our group, even called same day to confirm it, yet when we arrived they said they had no record of it in their system ! . waited min for a table, were comped a pitcher of margaritas but really just give us a table went for drinks after work and they gave me the wrong credit card when i closed my tab, i did not realize until i got home, called to ask if they still had my card and they asked me to come in tomorrow and check because the bar is really busy right now, and also a lot of people are calling to get their credit cards uhm, what . i called again, explained if they no longer had my card and had given it to someone else i needed to know as soon as possible so i could cancel it. was told they could try to check later in the evening. they finally checked and called me back, they no longer had my card but had no idea where it had gone no charges had appeared on it so looks like they did not use it for someone else's bill. so, where is it ! and also, they did not seem to care that i had another customer's card! beyond absurd. never going back."
2701,Mary H.,1112,1,8/29/17,we had a great dinner upstairs with orlaeigh. then continued downstairs at the bar are you kidding me charging a service charge of percent hanging at the bar we are not cheap tourists my husband gave bucks anyway on top of your ridiculous charge.we will never go back there tourists check your bill
2702,Meredith M.,1112,1,2/22/17,"yes, it is national margarita day. yes, it is expected we would experience a wait at any mexican joint in the city. but we were quoted a thirty minute wait and did not get a table until two hours after arriving. the restaurant tried to make up for this with a round of free margs, but unfortunately with barely any standing room this really did not help. upon seating, we were told there was a . hour limit on our table. ok, but we waited for longer than that. one star for not being prepared for what you know would be a busy night and not setting proper expectations we easily could have and would have gone somewhere else had we known how long the wait would be."
2703,Erin L.,1112,1,2/17/17,"i wanted to give zero stars but the one star will go to the bartender. we waited for a table like normal, we got sat, and had a group of maybe . we had ordered drinks from the bar before we got sat. waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything we literally just got sat so i said we needed a minute. a bar back or someone came over just before that too and we said the same thing. so we waited. and we waited. probably minutes. never got to order the food. waitress slapped the checkbook on the table for my friends bucket of beers. never even asked us if we wanted food, which we were ready to order. had a talk w manager, he did not seem to care and defended her the whole time saying we sat there for two hours which was a complete lie. offered us food but did not want to eat their crap. bye"
2704,Jay K.,1112,1,12/25/16,"originally left a great review. then had horrible experiences. first, i ordered delivery. i live right around the corner. minutes after i ordered, a girl calls me to tell me they are out of chili. would have been nice to be told this sooner, but fine, no problem. i swap it for something else. they totally forget to bring it with my delivery. they also forget to bring the sides of guac sour cream etc that i asked for. when i call back to express my frustration, the girl tells me that it is not her fault quite rudely. she clearly has never worked a day in hospitality. very turned off. i think her name was shanastupidly, decided to give it one more shot on a friday night. what a mistake. place was clearly incapable of being a quality restaurant at this hour as they were more in bar mode . service was terrible. order was brought out incorrectly. some of the food was cold. terrible experiencesad, because they do cook up quality mexican food. unfortunately their staff has not been trained in hospitality and their overall management service is inconsistent."
2705,Terry D.,1112,1,10/30/16,"overpriced. there were of us. three ordered entrees one of which was a burrito . one did not eat. one had an appetizer. we had about drinks for the table. the total came to . i put in for two dos equis lager, a coconut shrimp appetizer and a shot of cheap tequila. the food is unremarkable mexican fare. average at best. left feeling as though we would been had. everyone was disappointed. not going back."
2706,Nikaus 2.,1112,1,8/29/16,i visited this place for friday dinner with my friends. very rude staff specially the manager. the waiter brought a hot sizzling plate and dropped it on my friends legs n she got a burn rash. the waiter did not have a curtesy to say sorry. on complaining this to manager he said there was no burns and asked us to pay the bill and leave. he was so rude to all of us. we had to call the cops and they got my friend examined and there was a burn mark which was painful. never ever visiting this place again.first thing i did not say entire plate jus a sizzling drop is enough to burn a skin proved by the cops and doc. second think the manager offered for cream and ambulance when we called the cops. and we did not hear a sorry or apology from the manager or waiter. third thing the manager could offer more help but just said pay the money and leave and that is wen we said this is unfair n inhuman . and last thing the two hour wait after burn is because she was trying to ease her skin by sprinkling water and rubbing ice over it. and wen even after two hours there was no apology but only inhuman treatment given to us jus cos the manager wanted the money from us and suppress the matter.please provide ur staff with some training and honesty.
2707,Camila B.,1112,1,8/1/16,its a beautiful place with terrible food. im sure that the stake in my quesadilla was made the night before. unless you like to chew on old gum you will not enjoy this.my vegetarian friend got a veggie enchilada that smelled like it fell into the fire. i did not even have to try it to taste the smokyness in it. even the tomatoes in the pico de gallo tasted old. i would not like to look in the kitchen fridge. i guess the decor was fun but there was nothing mexican about this place besides that.ps i have been to mexico. trust me the mexican food trucks are way better than this place.
2708,Princy A.,1112,1,5/8/16,"no.we called ahead of time to see if reservations were necessary. when we got a hold of someone they said they do not take reservations for this hour. when we arrived, the owner asked do you have a reservation uhm.excuse me !aside from that, this place is still a big fat 'no' in my book.wayy too loud.wayy too many people. this is where millennials come to be seen and take selfies. not where interesting people come to have good conversations."
2709,Vanessa H.,1112,1,4/18/16,clearly they did not want to take anymore orders because i came an hour before close but ppl were still in there and the bartender refused me service.
2710,Carlos G.,1112,1,3/18/16,"went in around on friday, hostess did not want to put our name on the wait list because other hostess does this duty . she did not know how long the wait was. we walked over to restaurant next door, adrienee's, and was seated right away."
2711,John B.,1112,1,12/14/15,"came in for dinner around pm on saturday evening. was seated fairly quick, even with a full house downstairs and a private party upstairs. ordered wasters and three cokes. they actually serve pepsi, so i asked the waitress not to give me one since i prefer coke i do not know why they cannot tell the customer that they are serving pepsi vs coke we ordered our food, and did not see the waitress again while our water glasses sat empty. food for of us came with an apology that the enchiladas for the th in the party would be coming shortly. the of us finished and no waitress and no food. we had to get the hostess to ask the waitress where our food was. waitress still never came back catherine . hostess came back and said it was coming. finally manager came, asked if there was any issues and we told him about the absentee waitress and no food. he said he was going to comp the enchiladas. food came but everyone was finished and she was not in mood to eat. waitress still never came and we had to get the manager to get our check. he gave us the check, with pepsi vs . he brought back check, we paid and left. the food that did come was average at best.i swear the black beans came out of a can. the cheese that was suppose to be on the side came with the enchiladas, we said why would we wnt that now when we were finished very unorganized. there are better places for mexican food.the general manager did send two emails offering comp food and drink, however i opted not to take up their offer.i went back on monday for lunch with a coworker who did not know of my experience there on saturday. i did not tell him of it either. he picked the place for lunch.service was better, food just ok.maybe two and half for that visit"
2712,Ken S.,1112,1,9/4/15,"horrible service, no one knew what was going on. the food was also bad. no flavor."
2713,Leila G.,1112,1,8/29/15,worst bartenders on stone street. they are not attentive and do not know how to use a remote control. both my friend and i got sick from their food on separate occasions.
2714,Tanner S.,1112,1,8/13/15,terrible atmosphere not at all kid friendly terrible food terrible service i would never recommend this place washrooms also filled with pee everywhere on the floor it is also very busy and messy while trying to find the washroom i got beer on my shirt and i had not even been drinking it was because someone had thrown some at me also i could not hear the person beside me even when they were trying to talk in my ear they actually had to yell over the yelling and music
2715,Hornamkis P.,1112,1,6/18/15,"the food was bad.the food was dry and old.we complained for the food and nobody came to apologize.tips were already included, % even though was not good.i do not recommend to anybody.worst mexican food in manhattan."
2716,Jay L.,1112,1,4/15/15,"i do not normally write yelp reviews, but i feel its my duty to let my fellow patrons know that i had food poisoning from this place. i ordered the steak tacos for lunch on monday and was out of commission for a good hours. again, i'm not one to bad mouth a restaurant if it is not needed, but i've been miserable for the past day and a half thanks to this place."
2717,Katie P.,1112,1,3/22/15,"my teenaged daughter and i ate lunch at the pearl street venue on thursday march th, . we had visited the statue of liberty and ellis island and we were looking for a reasonable place that could accommodate my glutenfree diet. as the place was full, we thought it might be good. the guacamole and chips were good but our entrees were bland. my daughter had the pulled pork tacos and i had the chicken enchiladas. we thought, ok, we will not be eating here again. then a few hours later after having arrived at our midtown hotel my daughter became violently ill. since the only thing that i did not eat that she ate were the pulled pork tacos, we suspect that the dish made her sick. she spent hours vomiting. luckily she recovered and the next day we continued with our tour of the city. if i had more time in the city, i would have reported them to the city health department, but as tourists we were leaving for toronto on saturday. under no circumstances eat here. you risk your life."
2718,Salima K.,1112,1,3/3/15,"i got there on a friday with two others, and the service is terrible. not only did they lie and say it would be a min wait, they kept telling people that who came in the door. i waited for an hour and a half and the hostess had to nerve to ask if i would share the next available table with another party of three! who in their right mind thought that was a good idea i ended up leaving because that was just ridiculous."
2719,Jessica R.,1112,1,1/23/15,"normally i like going to mad dogs the food is average, but the guacamole and the margaritas are generally very delicious. however after several incidents with the hostesses i have to provide a very low review for this place. there have been several occasions where i have come in at the end of the lunch hour when there are open tables available slightly larger than our party and i have been quoted that they have no seating and our wait is minutes. there was not an attempt for creativity, or a realization that that the lunch hour is over and there will be no other onslaught of customers so they could sit us at a larger table. instead there was only a very cold response and a completely indifferent attitude towards us. on one occasion a supervisor intervened and was able to sit us, of course the supervisor went upstairs and realized that two smaller tables could be pushed together something that hostess was unable to figure out. i can not express how disappointed i was today with hostesses, i do not think i will be coming back."
2720,Melissa A.,1112,1,9/19/14,"so it is unfortunate that we are still sitting here and ordered nearly minutes ago and are still waiting for our food.we just asked for our check and since they changed our waitress she has not even realized we did not get our entrees. we waited minutes for our first round of beer and the people that came over a half hour later got their food before us.very disappointing when you are on a time schedule and think an hour and a half to eat would suffice but it did not due to extreme oversights on their part.so another minutes have passed and i was waiting for the outcome after voicing our disdain to our new waitress, she was very apologetic and spoke to the manager.we are glad to know that our time wasted was barely worth more than a beer."
2721,M D.,1112,1,8/29/14,"the staff is unintelligible and extremely rude.love their guacamole extra spicy so purchased it along with a side of sour cream.they forgot my side of sour cream understandable, when i went back the manager had the worst attitude saying well what should i do about it i told her to give me a refund or give me the item i purchased.i mean it is just sour cream it should not've been that big of a deal.so the manager laughs and has this sort of condescending attitude towards me and my friends.food is a .customer service is null."
2722,Zach S.,1112,1,8/22/14,"this was a misrepresentation of information. i called ahead of time and asked about happy hour. the girl that answered said yes, it goes from . she never said where it happens. so, we got charged full price. do not sit outside for happy hour. you will get robbed. happy hour only happens at the bar.i will not be back anytime soon."
2723,Bill R.,1113,5,10/12/18,"a must for tourist. get in line, get your ticket, get your pastrami sandwich and enjoy. the place is percent tourist trap but it super fun and tasty food. the sandwich is tasty and the pickles are divine. do not loose that ticket, or it costs to get out the door with out it!"
2724,Sinan Z.,1113,5,8/25/18,this place really meets the hype!!the hot pastrami on rye is soooo great! i also got the matzo ball soup and i enjoyed it as well! the line looked really long but it moves fast. this is a musttry!!
2725,Samantha L.,1113,3,10/15/18,"pastrami is good but i do not think it is worth it for the price and the amount of tourists bustling inside.i came here on a monday for lunch in september and it was packed inside. it is not tourist season it was a monday. i wonder how busy it gets on the weekends during the summer!!!after semi pushing through the crowd i was finally able to stand in line and order. i ordered the pastrami sandwich and the butcher gave us samples of the pastrami. the pastrami was so hot and delicious.however, each sandwich is ~ . granted, you can probably share the sandwich with one other person but it is not a huge sandwich.after you order, find a seat, and sit down with your food, the pastrami cools down a bit and it is not as good as when it is hot. because of this, i thought the sandwich was just alright. definitely not worth . bread breaks apart super easily as well. if you come here, make sure to be in good company because the food are not worth. in my opinion, the hype of this place is not real.although the pastrami is good, the chaotic jumble of this place makes it not worth it. this place is more like a try once for the experience type of place."
2726,Adele P.,1113,3,10/15/18,"ancient tourist trap. there is better out there. we come here with out of town guests who want to see the place, but honestly, you can get this stuff at smaller delis with a better selection.cash only, long lines, has not been updated since my grandmother went there as a kid. the pastrami is good, the attitude is annoying. if i'm going to go to a cashonly establishment with nyc clout, i'm going to go to eisenberg's."
2727,Allison F.,1113,5,10/9/18,katz's is the most delicious nyc institution worth the hype. come early before it gets too crazy packed full of folks. i only had a short wait on a late morning morning.
2728,B C.,1113,4,11/2/18,the hot pastrami is to die for. everything else is a combo of nostalgic good and tourists bad .enjoy!
2729,Jeannette M.,1113,3,11/5/18,"ordered the meat combo, nothing special other then the hype of tourist visit and of course i'm one of them. order the ruben at least the sauerkraut can help the dryness of the meat. drench my meat with mustard to help the meat moisture . also do not loose your ticket if you loose it even if you want to go in for a visit."
2730,Eleri W.,1113,5,11/6/18,"hands down the best sandwich i have ever had. you never really want to hand it to the overly popular places, but i got to say, they really have their deli down. our guy gave us tastes of different meats that were all absolutely mouthwatering. he was sooo friendly too! once we got our sammies, we could not wait to dig in they were works of art! they may be known for the infamous i will have what she is having moment but i will honestly have whatever whoever is having because i guarantee it will be fresh, flavorful, and stacked!"
2731,Sarah P.,1113,4,8/8/18,"oh, the famous katz. there is so much to love about you.this staple in the les is a must eat if you are a meat lover.i've had that reuben +pastrami and the macaroni salad. guys, the meat is tender, juicy and piled high, but what was such a surprise to me was the macaroni salad. i am constantly craving it now.if the food was not amazing in itself, the theatrics of the whole thing make it a cool place to stop in.when you walk in you get a ticket for all your ordering needs. the place is jam packed with people mostly tourists . you choose which meat cutter you wish to order from. take in the giant restaurant filled to the brim with pictures and memorabilia. watch the cuter slice your meat, taste a bite and get ready for the pile of meat you just ordered.it is truly unique and gives you a taste of old new york.the only thing to gripe about is the price tag. get ready to she will out at least for one sandwich, but at the end of the day, it is worth it."
2732,Melissa L.,1113,5,11/2/18,"okay, so it is crowded and you will likely end up sharing a table with someone kind enough to consolidate seatsbut the meat. oh, the juicy meat! add homemade pickles and traditional deli vibe and you have a destination eat for the bucket list. the line moves fast, folks. cash only. you will not regret it."
2733,Biana G.,1113,5,10/13/18,"while most people go the conventional pastrami on rye approach, i encourage you to give the hotdog and noodle soup a try on your next go around. katz is a city staple and highly highly recommended!! prices are on the high end and there may be a wait, but it moves quickly."
2734,Leslie W.,1113,5,8/20/18,"i had my first ever reuben here and i'm sure it will be the best reuben too. the juice, the flavor, the texture of the pastrami set a really high bar for all the pastrami yet to come in my life.the intrigue of katz's also lies in the physical environment. the decor, the crowdedness, the hard journey to the table while trying to secure your plate in a sea of people, the faces, the ticket system lifted the whole katz's experience to another level. it made so much sense to me why katz's is so popular. i loved it!"
2735,Debi R.,1113,3,7/27/18,"i wanted to love this place. we were a party of and we all ordered something different.of course we ordered the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. we also had cheese steak sandwiches, chicken sandwiches and more. most of the meat was on the dry side. our overall rating of the food was average.the way you order is a bit confusing. upon entry you get a ticket. when you order your food, you give the server your ticket and they write the price it and return it to you. the same goes for ordering sides and drinks. you pay as you exit. if you lose your ticket, you pay .which would have been perfect if we lost ours, cuz after sandwiches, sides and many beers they would have lost money!staff was friendly and helpful when asked how to navigate the ordering system.the only time i said, i will have what she is having. is when i was asked if i wanted another beer."
2736,Raymond L.,1113,5,7/16/18,"i came here at am on a weekday and they were still getting ready with all the bread and supplies going through the back, and then going to the front of the line where everyone is waiting to assist.you get a ticket when you enter and i've been told not to lose it. so i suggest you would not lose it either haha. i got in line and immediately knew what i was going to get. pastrami sandwich on rye, with mustard. it also comes with pickles and cucumbers as well. i got it to go but you very well could eat it here there are plenty of tables here. oh yeah, they also give you a small plate, a sample kinda, of the pastrami to see if it is to your liking.for paying, if you are paying by credit card, you would have to go way in the back because that is the one place that they have to pay by cc. cash is up front. here is where keeping that blue ticket pays off and gets you out of here.the pastrami is good. it is not too too too salty and has a lot of flavor you will have to taste it to experience it haha. it is made perfectly and was a welcome addition to my stomach at in the morning haha. there is layers on layers on layers and just so much meat in there that you will understand why it is over haha.probably would come back if i were in the area, maybe try something else haha"
2737,Stephanie G.,1113,4,7/17/18,"it is popular, crowded, loud, and kind of uncomfortable, but it is a must try.i went on a saturday afternoon to try to hit off hours. for the record, i've tried to eat here before but saturday night the wait was insane. it is a little confusing inside. they hand you a ticket that you have to give back on your way out there is a sign threatening a fine if you lose it but i cannot tell if it is a joke or not . you can either order at counter and find a place to sit or you can get waiter service and you cannot sit in the wrong place or they will quickly ask you to move. we were told our person party would be a half hour wait but we were seated in less than .there is a few things on the menu, but the pastrami is a must have. they make it in house and it is like no other meat you have ever had. i got it on rye bread and a sign threatened about asking for mayo again not sure if this was a joke but the meat comes out so hot and juicy and salty and succulent you do not really need any condiments and i love condiments .they also give a complementary bowl of pickles, which is probably great if you like pickles. i also got a side of fries since it seemed like a good idea with the sandwich a the fries were amazing too b the sandwich is enormous so only consider if you are sharing.i only ate half the sandwich, so big and delightful as it was, then i felt kind of queasy later it is a lot of meat on a sandwich then the next day i had my other half sandwich cold, and it was still pretty good. it is no fresh hot sandwich, but still close.some cons we got in line to exit pay, waited until we were in the front to tell us it is cash only there and you can use a credit card in the back. hey that would have been nice to know before waiting in line. there was very little seating if you ordered at counter, so consider that if you are trying to skip the waiter. it is also like a sandwich which the highest priced nonlobster roll sandwiches i've ever eaten. but if you can come on an off hour or take it to go somewhere where it will still be hot, oh man. it is a must try."
2738,Shannon H.,1113,3,9/22/18," been there done that type of place! very crowded, disorganization to the max, waiter service was not great, high prices, some of the food was spectacular! basically a tourist trap.i have been hearing about katz's since what feels like centuries ago.but i was disappointed in the pure chaotic disorganization that ensued during my visit. walking in and it being my first time i had no idea what i was doing. they just hand you a ticket with no explanation on what comes next. well i'm here to explain it to you you are handed a ticket, keep it.it is basically your receiptat the end of the meal your server will fill it out. next you can either pick between self service or waiter service. if you choose self you walk right up to the window of your liking and order your food. after you can sit in the designated areas and enjoy it. if you choose waiter service you will need to give your name to the host. after your name has been called you will be seated on the left wall at one of the tables. if your in a small party they will shove you with another small group. at the end of your meal you can pay at the front.i wish someone would have explained it all to us but everything overall was way too chaotic for my liking.now for the service. our waiter was very abrasive and was not friendly. i was not impressed with the service whatsoever. the food came in around min i'm assuming because of the crowd.the prices are high and honestly i would pay for the pastrami again because i felt that it was worth it. i loved how juicy & tender it was and the rye bread complimented the meat perfectly. as for the corned beef.absolutely disgusting!! it was super dry and had a nasty after taste. the chopped liver w onion best chopped liver i've ever had hands down!!overall i most likely will not visit again. been there done that! the service was not great and it was too crowded and unorganized."
2739,Shane E.,1113,5,7/21/18,"you take an institution like this and think, it is a tourist trap. how good could it be but then you finally bite the bullet because you have seen and heard about it for years and now it is saturday with some time to kill. this line is moving pretty quickly, you say to yourself as you check your watch. pm. they wrangle you into a corner if you are waiting for a table , but then they say, feel free to grab a beer at the bar. duh. the cold yeungling is a glass full of beer smiles being poured over your brain.not minutes later, we are being sat right next to the table from when harry met sally . we take in our surroundings, checking out all the notable people immortalized on the katz wall.we have already decided on reuben, add pastramimac saladlatkes + sour cream & apple sauceyou have already lowered the expectation that if it is not great, you will not be surprised. but it is. and it is delicious. and that is how you stay in business for as long as you have been.our pastrami was so moist, just a well constructed sandwich with all the perfect condiments. mac salad was bright and creamy, not too sweet. latkes. c'mon, how can you go wrong with fried potato cakes.we finished up a little past three and the line out the door was no longer.tl dr worth the wait, try and come off hours, pastrami and latkes all day"
2740,Iona N.,1113,3,11/2/18,"i do not know why this place is very popular. is list one of the top have try out when you in new york. i order their pastrami sandwich. they meat is good, but i want in the french bread instead of bread slide. i did not know their extras , other wise i order come with it already. the sandwich very simple, just meat and bread. very boring. i used to have my sandwich with vegetable, and sauce or mayonnaise in my sandwich. this style, is definitely is not my style of sandwich. they give you cucumbers and pickles on the side but i preferred my sandwich with cheese and vegetables instead. their sandwich is pretty pricy, for a portion of one person. i ask had their bottle tea. kat lemon ice tea, which is pretty good. that bottle cost about . . at least now i can said that i come here. also, they will give you a ticket, if you lost your ticket you will paid at least minimum plus what ever food you ate. that insane, i saw the guy lost his ticket and he worry so bad, i did not know what going on, i was curious. when i left she told me plus the food. also, there two kind of service, you can sit at the table that actually has someone to serve, or you can order by the stand and ask for sample. come here again, probably not, because new york has to many good restaurant and i want to try them all."
2741,Nancy C.,1113,3,10/3/18,"their service, ordering process, and prices suck but i've been a few times because the pastrami is sooo flavorful and juicy. i hate the rule that if you lose your ticket you have to pay . wtf i would literally scream.and the lines are an absolute mess. the staff is not very helpful and some have unfounded attitudes. almost got charged for two sandwiches instead of one but luckily caught their mistake.love your meat but hate you"
2742,Michelle J.,1113,5,10/11/18,"i love the vibe of this place! truly iconic and old school. grab a ticket as soon as you walk in and head over to the counters where you can order. i got the pastrami sandwich on rye bread with mustard on it. while i was waiting for my sandwich to be made, the guy gave me a few pieces to try. the meat was really soft and juicy. not dry at all. after you get your order, hand the ticket to the guy, he will give it back to you and you will have to bring it to the next counter to pay. they do accept card and apple pay! i also love the pickles and cucumbers that came with it. it is a shame that i've lived in nyc all my life and i've never once visited this place. i will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches."
2743,Tiffany J.,1113,5,8/23/18,"worth.please come here.with over reviews and all the fame it needs, there is not much for me to say. the only beef i've had that topped this was texas brisket. enjoy the heap of pastrami between two pieces of rye and nothing else other than cucumbers and pickles . i love the conceptthe entire show is on the pastrami.otherwise, portions are huge, so be mindful. ordering can be confusing, and lines can get long, so ask before you waste too much time.the matzo ball soup is also pretty good. reminds me of the chinese meatballs from my childhood, but much softer. i also got to try chopped liver and kugel for the first time, which was. interesting. but i am certainly not qualified to say much about kugel or chopped liver."
2744,K. Supreme C.,1113,5,10/24/18,"my favorite deli hands down. my pops has been taking me here for decades!!! the pastrami fries with a cherry coke is a must! the best pastrami you will ever have.prices are up there, but well worth it. no complaints. always crowded. sometimes the line is out the door."
2745,Michael G.,1113,4,11/8/18,"weeeee! this place was amazing. the food is to die for, seriously. i had a reuben sandwich that was huge, but i ate every bite! pickles. yum. my husband had outstanding matzo ball soup.and fries i know. . it is crowded and loud. i would suggest going at an off time as the regular meal hours have very long lines. having said that, however, the staff is a delight. i mean it. everyone was fantastic, and you could tell they were treated well. plus, who can resist the classic new yorker people will tell you that it is touristy. to that, i say, eh. these are new york prices after all, and some people find that not acceptable.boo hoo! go and have a great time. there are very few tables that have waiter service, and you have to ask for them. otherwise, walk in and step up to the counter. know what you want and eat all you get. it is fantastic."
2746,Sean W.,1113,4,6/9/18,"katz's is a classic deli that is known to attract lots of tourists and locals. it is also open late to boot. they are known for selling substantial sandwiches, but they also sell other deli staples. they have a very odd ticketing system, make sure you do not lose it! the venue is fairly large, one orders at the counter with their ticket. service is pretty quick.ordered pastrami sandwich very large portion, but also pretty basic. a very solid pastrami sandwich to be honest. not the best i've had that would be the refuge in san carlos, ca , but definitely something i would get again. i think the bread could have been a bit thicker and toasted. the mustard could also be stronger."
2747,Melissa H.,1113,3,10/27/18,"okay. so this place is famous, historic and very crowded. but the lines move fast, so there is that. it is a bit confusing for a newcomer. if you are ordering at the counter, you have to know right away if you are going to get in line for the cutters sandwiches or down further for other hot dishes or drinks. know what you want before you get there! and ask someone to help you find it. we ended up just having a lox everything bagel and it was very good. sat next to the when harry met sally table go here at least once for the crazy experience!"
2748,Jason C.,1113,3,5/29/18,"pretty good sandwiches, distinguished by its humongous portion. and the environment is very friendly even though its joined by people from all over the world.to me the price is a bit much for this sandwich, and it does not look very hygienic on the other side of the counter. the unwanted parts of meat were just dumped on the floor, knowing how dirty and infested nyc is, this could be very very disgusting even if they clean it every day."
2749,John M.,1113,3,10/25/18,"when harry met yada yada yada . . . crazy big portions. a little over kill if you ask me. if you go with a friend order one sandwich and share.not really a huge fan of pastrami, but it is a good sandwich. once or twice every years.give it a try."
2750,Oisin W.,1113,5,11/6/18,the best pastrami sandwhich you will have in your life! reasonably priced in an iconic setting i believe a trip to katz deli should be on the itenirary of every person visiting new york
2751,Ella S.,1113,4,10/31/18,"just order the pastrami sandwich. and get it to share. it is gigantic. and delicious.ignore the herds of tourists sorry tourists, we love you, but you do move like a herd . skip the weekends.that is it."
2752,Na S.,1113,5,9/6/18,"i know it is pricey, but it is the juiciest pastrami around. if you are wondering about which kind of meat to get, i highly recommend the pastrami. my friend did not believe me and ordered a combination platter of brisket, pastrami, and corned beef. guess what happened we inhaled the pastrami. ended up packing the rest to go.you could order at the counter and ask for samples before you commit. it is usually very busy though so it is not exactly a relaxing place to ponder the big decision. if you do not feel like scouting for your own table, you have the option of getting table service. the only thing is you do not get to try samples but a great option if you want to sit, now.if you are feeling adventurous, the liver is very good as well. get it from the coldcut counter by weight will save you a few bucks."
2753,Lincy H.,1113,5,5/14/18,"holy smokes! katz's is an absolute must when in new york. my week long trip was basically a foodie adventure and this was definitely one of my favorite meals.my friends and i came right at lunch time, but were surprised to see only a few people in line. this is because they have the most efficient process ever! there are about different cutters to take your order and prep your food, and then you pay after you finish eating your meal as you are heading out. do not lose your ticket! there are also tons of seating.my boyfriend and i split one pastrami sandwich because we indulged in meals on our last full day in ny . the pastrami is freaking amazing. so tender and flavorful and just beautiful. the fatty slices melt in your mouth. their pickles and cucumber add the perfect crunch too. glad i got to squeeze in some veggies into my system p my only gripe is that their bread was just whatever. toasted dutch crunch or perhaps sourdough would make it the perfect sandwich. but still stars because their pastrami is just that good. i can die happy now."
2754,Gregg Y.,1113,5,8/28/18,pastrami. gold standard.katz's is the real deal.do not lose that ticket.
2755,alexis f.,1113,5,11/7/18,love this place! been going my whole life! you cannot go wrong with a hot dog & matzoh ball soup!
2756,Shanel T.,1113,5,8/22/18,"i've been coming to katz since i was a kid, and i know whenever i need a good sandwich & i mean good! katz is the place to go! everything is kosher, and everything is fresh. upon walking in you get your ticket to order your food, stand in line waiting to be called next. but, in doing so you have to check out the huge mural wall of pictures with any, and every celebrity you can think of since the place has been open. when you order your food, you get to taste some of the samples, whether it is pastrami, corn beef, etc. these are my top faves & let us not forget their distinct pickles!!! loveeee their pickles! after done ordering, if you can find a seat you will have one of the best lunch dinner sandwiches of your life. you pay after you finish eating also! i love katz, and it never disappoints me at all."
2757,Meems N.,1113,5,11/5/18,i only leave ratings for restaurants that i would definitely come back to. you can read the gazillion other reviews already on yelp.
2758,Sam A.,1113,5,10/27/18,yelp it is fake star for yelp but katzs delicatessen is % real and very good spot for good pastrami and more
2759,Stephen S.,1113,5,11/6/18,ok. the sandwiches are huge. and eye popping expensive. and fantastic flavor. honest new york deli. not used to nyc prices will be aghast at the prices. but the food is good and plentiful.
2760,Lotus H.,1113,2,8/24/18,"last time i was in here the place was empty. but the system they had attempts to move large crowds thru numbered cutter lines. wait was mins at in the afternoon. pricy sandwiches, rude staff, customer service was nonexistent. built on hype dirty and soso food. i'm sticking to the smaller delis with better prices, atmosphere, food and service."
2761,Rebecca A.,1113,5,9/2/18,"well i know it is been said a thousand times but this food is amazing. the ordering system is a little confusing and do not lose your ticket, but you get a ticket and then approach a line, pick any # they move pretty quickly.we split the reuben with a side of fries and a coke and it was my favorite meal of my entire new york trip which is saying something . they gave us two different brined pickles, i liked the two varieties. the meat on the reuben is savory, meaty and scrumptious. you will find yourself hankering for it days and even weeks later.bonus if you are into chick flicks they filmed the infamous i will have what she is having scene from when harry met sally at the restaurant they have a sign if you forget ."
2762,Jacob W.,1113,4,11/8/18,"blockchain support phone number, reliable solution at the right timei was stuck in traffic on houston street on my way to the holland, in pouring rain, right in fi would like to know where new yorkers go for pastrami's. when i was there, everyone looked like tourists. i have to believe new yorkers do not pay for a pastrami sandwich, no matter how good it is.wait! suggestions . split a sandwichthey are huge seriously like over a pound of meat on each! avg sandwich . seat yourself and order at counter this takes less time and is part of the experience.read morephoto of adrian a.adrian a. elite ' why cannot i give this place stars or even ! this place is literally the embodiment of what a sandwich shoront of this place yesterday. i was hungry as hell, so i lucked out that there was a parking place right there on the opposite side of the street. i saw no line outside, and i had a nice amount of cash on my pocket so i knew my chances of getting a."
2763,Brian C.,1114,4,4/11/17,"before i ever made it to the city, i had heard quite a bit about this place from my friends who had lived here. they really talked it up and made it sound like the bees knees, so needless to say there were quite some expections riding on this place for me. spoiler, this place lives up to the hype quite easily!i will get my lone grievence of this place out of the way early on, and that is the price point. is a bit much to spend on one meal, but no one can question the quality, variety, or richness of flavor you will get from this meal! i regret not getting the lobster roll, and settled for the shrimp roll. while you do not get large pieces of shrimp per se, you still get numerous pieces, and the taste is complimented by a toasted butter roll, with a savory sauce as well. i did get a taste of the lobster with the bisque, and that was amazing and a meal in itself definitely get the combo with the sandwhich .overall, if you are in the city you should eat here without any hesitation. the price is a little high, but the quality and experience are just as high as well. to me, this was a classic new york lunch, and the only way it could have been better was if i were eating outside in battery park on a cool spring afternoon."
2764,Yifan D.,1114,2,9/1/18,"preordered the luke's favorite online and picked up in store, and very disappointed. . they forgot to give me chips. . the lobster roll was extremely salty.conclusion too salty, too expensive i got the double sized lobster roll in boston at about the same price , and the server is careless."
2765,Cigar N.,1114,4,8/24/18,clean fresh and tasty. place is super small.i had the trio and each one was a nice taste packed with meat not stuffed with mayo or fillers.check it out!
2766,Isabelle L.,1114,5,9/4/17,best lobster roll ever!!!the crab roll and the shrimp roll are on the salty side but lobster is just right!the soup is at ok level but rolls are amazing!no lines at pm on labor day.
2767,Tonya M.,1114,5,2/1/18,we ate here on my birthday and i was not disappointed! the dining area is small but i figure most people get theirs to go for lunch. we each had the lobster roll and it was fantastic! reasonable price for the quality of food too. would absolutely go back when in nyc again.
2768,Shea M.,1114,4,8/11/17,pretty good food! portions were kind of smaller than initially expected but still good food. i had a lobster roll with some bbq chips on the side with a lemon line drink. yum!
2769,Genevieve L.,1114,4,2/13/18,"i wanted to try this place out since i've heard so many good things! my friend and i got the trio and the lobster mac and cheese to share. the staff was really friendly and helpful. they have happy hour everyday on drinks from pm for those who like to wind down after work.for tourists, this is really close to the charging bull and fearless girl! about a minute walk give or take. even though the portions are small luke's is definitely worth a try if you are in town. it is no maine but probably the best you will get in the city."
2770,He Z.,1114,5,5/15/18,"freshcatch lobster, with simple n sweet preparation, offering you marvellous taste, which may redefine your concept about seafood. the salad n soup also worth a try, no fancy layout or mysterious recipe, just healthy, inseason materials served with their utmost original flavour. this shop definitely top my recommendation list."
2771,Alice Z.,1114,5,8/29/17,"the taste of maine from luke's lobster is the perfect option to try if you cannot decide on what seafood to get. if includes crab, lobster, and shrimp roll, and comes with chips and a drink. the rolls are crispy and buttery, and the seafood is fresh and perfectly seasoned. my favorite out of the had to be the lobster roll, and they give out generous portions on seafood in their rolls. the service was great, and i loved the nautical theme of the restaurant."
2772,Jack K.,1114,5,6/9/18,the food here was great. the lobster roll was the best of the trio sampler. do not think you can split your order with someone as the portion is not enough to split. the lobster crab shrimp was a chilled version. i would have preferred hot. the staff was friendly and service was quick.
2773,Ken P.,1114,5,6/15/17,"ambience picture the old style lobster shack on the docks along us in maine. crowded and hectic especially at peak lunchtime but well worth the wait.food so far i've had their shrimp roll, the crab roll and the lobster roll on separate occasions . the shrimp and crab rolls were above average but not perfect. say out of for either yet still well worth the price. the lobster roll is a delight . chunks of tender lobster meat in a buttered new england style roll. a definite ."
2774,Scooter M.,1114,4,4/16/18,"well, i'm going over some of my reviews and thinking back to my trip to new york and i upped this place to four stars. i've been thinking about how delicious the lobster itself was and how fresh, and i was put off by the fact that it was served ice cold and for me i'm poor how exorbitant the price was for so little food. i'm thinking that this was unfair. if you are not put off by the price, or that the lobsters cold, you might really enjoy this place! the staff was super friendly and the decor is cute. lobster itself was absolutely delicious."
2775,Chris H.,1114,5,1/23/18,"amazing beyond belief. coming from the south east, i doubted the quality. i was set straight at the first bite! amazing trio with the crab roll being my personal favorite. had the bisque that was off the chart. i would fly back to nyc just to eat here!!!"
2776,Lindsi G.,1114,4,4/24/18,"sought out a lobster lunch spot after getting off the staten island ferry ride. lobster roll and lobster bisque were both great. staff was super friendly, too, and the place was pretty empty at pm on a tuesday. took off a star for the size to price disproportionality. i'm happy to pay for a solid lobster roll, but this one could have been % bigger for the price. otherwise had a great experience!"
2777,David F.,1114,5,12/9/17,"wow. really, wow.i do not have a lot of experience with lobster rolls, but given my experience at luke's i'm going to dive in to this world.i did not expect the lobster to be cold in the roll but after a few bites it was clear that this is the way god intended it. an excellent butter salty seasoning of some kind soaked the thing it was excellent.i had a large bowl of lobster bisque as well also excellent with a nice chunk of lobster meat in the bottom. they apparently buy the soup from some company in maine but i'm pretty sure they put the fresh crab in it.its more of a grab and go place a few places to sit but its not like a date place.excellent"
2778,Ivy C.,1114,5,9/29/18,nice place! super fresh lobster roll and crab roll also.definitely a must check if you are around
2779,Stephanie H.,1114,5,5/27/17,"awesome lobster rolls, whole claws and chunks of tail. they are lightly dressed so that it really highlights the lobster. i always trended towards less is more when it comes to real quality ingredients. hiding it in mayo, butter, and salt is totally a trick to hide things going bad. but luke's lobster has superb quality ingredients. it was so so delicious that i'm already craving another one. we got one as a snack while my mom and i were walking around manhattan after a week of dreary weather, the sun finally broke through and we wanted to take advantage of it. this was the perfect snack!"
2780,Michael J.,1114,5,3/25/18,"visiting from ca just got off the very chilly liberty ellis island boat and needed a good seafood warmup! had the lobster roll, mac & cheese and lobster bisque. omg!! everything was amazing!!!"
2781,Dawny M.,1114,4,7/24/17,"come for the lobster roll. small, limited seating. perfect to grab a quick lunch bite. i gave it a only because the chowder was not the best. service was friendly and attentive even though it is a serve yourself place."
2782,Marc G.,1114,4,7/19/17,"small place. really small. but somehow they have made the atmosphere welcoming. the staff is great and the lobster roll is delicious. do i wish it was bigger well. yeah, of course. and maybe a little cheaper that, too.but when you are craving a lobber roll in nyc, hit one of luke's multiple locations. i have not been disappointed on three different visits!"
2783,Linda L.,1114,4,2/24/18,"decided to check out this place after visiting the statue of liberty since this location is close by battery park. got here at pm on a saturday and surprisingly no line. my bf and i order the lobster roll and lobster mac n cheese. both were delicious. just be warn portions are quite small. i expected this and did not want to be too full in order to try other things in nyc. definitely a must try lobster roll. you get good chunks of lobster meat! plus one star for price. we paid for things, mindful they are for lobster."
2784,Desiree H.,1114,5,9/18/18,oh so good. staff was no nice and accommodating. i cannot eat bread and got a salad with the trio meats. yum!
2785,Mia W.,1114,3,6/5/17,"does not travel wellthis was my first trip to luke's lobster and probably my last. my experience was much better than the actual lobster roll.the restaurant is quite small, but very adorable. the decor is very shipie. the cashier was very polite and helpful, but this is where my gushing ends.i ordered the trio lobster roll, shrimp roll, crab roll but requested that the shrimp roll be replaced with another lobster roll. when i got back to my hotel room hungry and ready to chow down i discover that they gave me three lobster rolls. insert gasp i guess i do not get to taste the crab roll.also, the rolls do not travel well, so eat them right there. the bun is warm and buttery and wonderful, but the lobster is ice cold, so what you get is a luke warm bun with a buttery film on your tongue.i see the potential, but something did not quite work."
2786,Tony D.,1114,5,11/30/17,"when it comes to lobster rolls, luke's are the best. the lobster is fresh and the roll is simple, so the flavor of the lobster really shines through. i've tried the crab and shrimp rolls as well. all are good, but the shrimp was my least favorite. the portions are not that large, so you will need to either order more than roll or something else to go with it. i went with the luke's trio."
2787,Ryan M.,1114,2,5/7/17,"it was for a lobster roll and a side of slaw. i was surprised to find that the lobster is served cold on a warm buttered toasted hot dog bun. the taste was good but honestly i had high hopes for this bite of grub and it kinda let me down. it would have been expensively worth it at but is way too much. find somewhere else to spend your cash. also the drink selection was terrible and they did not even have ice for a water. the restaurant was too small for it is own good. there were only a few tables and we had to use the bar along the wall, which did not have open seats available. i would suggest going somewhere different."
2788,Scott T.,1114,4,7/13/18,"my first lobster roll. it was good but did not expect the lobster to be chilled. nice place, good location."
2789,E K.,1114,5,7/20/18,hands down the best lobster roll i have ever had! i have had what i consider amazing lobster rolls at chelsea market lobster place and in connecticut particularly new london but i really think luke's takes the cake for lobster roll! incidentallybut i also think indicative of their philosophy and excellent service and foodi stumbled on them on a recent trip to philadelphia and branched out to crab roll special of the day at the suggestion of the server and it was amazing as well. even if there is a line it moves fast thanks to friendly and efficient staff
2790,Zhijian J.,1114,4,9/4/17,the lobster is many and fresh and tender. and the bread has crispy she will. but a little tasteless for me.maybe you could order a green bee honey soda.
2791,Franco Z.,1114,5,12/24/17,"the portion is not as big as i imagined, however, the taste is incredible and it worths the price. location is not hard to find."
2792,Mai P.,1114,4,6/14/17,"alright so do not get me wrong. the lobster roll is delicious!!! but for , it is really hard to justify the size. see my picture and hand for comparison. the lobster was super juicy, and the bread was so buttery and soft. if you are one of those people who can drop on a meal no drinks or sides included , then the food is great."
2793,Alex D.,1114,3,4/13/18,the portions are pretty small. very comparable to tapas style food. the food was good. had the lobster roll and my friend had the trio. i liked the bread the rolls were served on too. bread was toasted and very tasty. i would say the pricing for the portions is a bit expensive. for the lobster roll. that is my only knock on them.
2794,Andrew C.,1114,4,3/13/18,"i love getting food here despite the fact it is a good min walk, plus like today when it was a mix of rain and snow i still came out and walked the trek of horrid hotness and sweating. stars because i nearly broke a tooth in the crab roll because there was a dingdangdoodly she will in my roll, props otherwise"
2795,Katharine W.,1114,5,4/27/18,great lobster rolls and lobster bisque! the flavor of the lobster is scrumptious and paired with a buttery not too thick roll makes eating this roll an amazing experience! will definitely visit this place again when in the financial district!
2796,Emily C.,1114,5,2/16/18,"update my mistake was not going for the lobster roll. the lobster roll was amazing and perfectly seasoned. i'm a big bisque fan and that is the reason why i went for the bisque. the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. legen wait for it dary.i had the lobster bisque, and i've had better. i also order the a lobster tail, and it was bland. there was no flavor, and after eating the lobster bisque, it did not settle well. i'm drinking ginger ale hoping it helps my stomach. the service there was great, the people working there were friendly."
2797,Brian G.,1114,1,6/9/18,"we ordered two lobster rolls takeout at a piece and was quit disappointed. it lacked freshness, the rolls tasted like they have been sitting there for hours, the same as when you toast bread, leave it in the refrigerator, then take it out for several hours. lobster tasted anything but fresh. it is not a reflection of the service but the product and ownership should be more cognizant of serving a better product even at that price range, and to label anything in their establishment as maine is deceiving since they tasted more like they were from gristedes. stars. go elsewhere."
2798,Marj B.,1114,4,9/9/18,"friendly staff, prompt service. lobster roll was excellentlotsa really fresh lobster. clam chowder was tasty, too."
2799,Jon W.,1114,4,6/12/16,"luke's lobster just became my lobster!these lobster rolls are the lobster roll standard the perfect amount of lobster to mayo to roll they just do it right here.when you get into this tiny spot everything is wood and has the feeling of stepping on to a ship like you are about to go catch some lobsters . argghg mate!i got the lobster roll combo that comes with a lobster roll, chips or cole slaw, pickle, and any non alcoholic drink.the blueberry lemonade was calling my name for the drink and it was really sweet from the honey they put in, but had a nice level of blueberry to melo it out.the lobster roll was awesome and tasty with every bit but you just eat it so fast because it is kind of small my co worker bought two.the service was super quick and walk outside as there was a bunch of seating outside to catch some rays while i ate.in short great lunch spot quick order food friendly staff a little pricey expect to spend at least after tax"
2800,C K.,1114,4,5/17/18,"the lobster roll and crab roll were delish. shrimp was ok in my book . the staff was friendly and accommodating. however, they did say we could sit at a table in the alley. i'm sure they did not know, but when we tried to sit at the tables in the alley, we were not welcome per the wait staff of the restaurants there . a little obnoxious from the dubliner.there were many empty tables. anyway, the rolls are great.get some now!"
2801,Zinan X.,1114,4,5/4/17,"i can see why people are in love with this place fresh ingredients, friendly people and nice vibe, and i like it too, just not a star like.i got the lobster roll and the shrimp roll, they were pretty small, i still felt a bit hungry after eating both. they were not really too flavorful, although they tasted refreshing, and since i'm big on the flavor of food in terms of rating, i'm going to take a star out."
2802,Garrett F.,1114,4,5/29/16,"i was hungry and craving seafood, so i turned to yelp and ended up at luke's lobster.food i could not decide, so i ordered both the lobster and crab roll.they were both really tasty!i liked the lobster roll more because when eating the crab roll, i would occasionally bite into shells.sides notesambiance the restaurant is super small. i ate at luke's lobster around p.m. on a weekday and there was only one person eating. i bet it gets packed during lunch, though!service the staff was super nice i felt like they gave me their honest recommendations.overall if you are craving seafood, stop on by!"
2803,Karen K.,1114,1,11/2/17,"a bit disappointed. looks are definitely deceiving. the reviews on here are old & the menu has changed. i had the luke's trio which includes of all three crab, shrimp, lobster. do not waste your money. they are small & i found the crab meat to be super salty, the lobster roll was tasteless not like your normal lobster roll. before they a trio that included all three with a drink, side of chips and or pickle which costed more but i'm assuming worth it. before . now . honestly the best part or the rolls was the buttery toasted buns. my coworker had a cold drink that is was pretty gross in her words. they do have a lobster mac & cheese that i wanted to try but after today's experience i might just take that thought back!"
2804,Rachel M.,1114,1,10/28/17,"i just stopped by luke's for a shrimp roll for lunch after reading such great reviews. a bottle of water, a bag of chips, and one shrimp roll cost me . . i leave the shop to go eat it on a park bench, and open up the container to find the most disappointing, and rather disgusting looking shrimp roll. the shrimp are small, cold, overcooked and basically just pink mush inside of a squished hot dog bun. it is extremely disappointing and compared to the raving reviews, i'm extremely confused as to why people return here if this is how you are going to be ripped off."
2805,Shelia E.,1114,1,10/18/17,this was the place i chose to have dinner for my birthday.very disappointed. who serves cold anything on warm toast. the soup was the best thing i ordered. do not recommend
2806,Guilherme M.,1114,1,4/20/17,really over priced. the lobster tail is the same size as a jumbo shrimp.they have good sodas tho
2807,Jackie A.,1114,1,8/17/16,i got the lobster roll which had very little lobster meat. it was not worth the . i would never return here. i was upset that i spent such money and did not get my worth. i was still hungry after eating the roll.
2808,Ck T.,1114,1,7/20/16," . tasteless. lobster, shrimp and crab roll, all of them are tasteless. no favor of seafood. need lots of pepper to add some taste . super expenseive, you pay usd to for a tiny roll with quarter pound lobster"
2809,Natalie P.,1114,1,6/20/16,"shockingly bad value for money. we ordered a taste of maine, getting roll of each of the specialties lobster shrimp crab. the portion size even of the was insulting, at !! the fillings were ice cold, flavorless and demonstrated no effort other than toasting the bread. very disappointed."
2810,Kyle B.,1114,1,6/12/16,"i used to come to this luke's often, however, i will never return due to their declining food quality and terrible customer service.my lobster roll came without butter or mayo. i took two bites then realized it the lobster and bread was completely dry. i realize people make mistakes, so brought it back to be replaced with one that does have all the ingredients. andrew the manager on duty refused to fix it or replace it with another one since i had taken a bite and even ventured to argue with me that it probably did have mayo, even before taking a look. i've been here + times so i know their standards, and it also looked completely different than my wife's.after arguing for minutes, it was only after i told andrew i would be calling his boss in the morning that he even offered to give me a partial refund. not even a full refund!luke's i used to love your food. but you have lost a longtime customer in me."
2811,Phillysgirl 3.,1114,1,12/30/15,"first, i just wasted . on this food. although they had a great idea when coming up with this, unfortunately they are lacking. second, they are way too expensive for the average person who is on a budget.i would have loved to have tried the lobster roll, except it was . just for the roll. from the looks of the amount of lobster while waiting for my order to be ready, i was glad i did not get the lobster roll. extremely skimpy. unfortunately, the best bet for me financially was to order the shrimp roll with the soup combo, and by shrimp, i mean baby shrimp wha whaaaaa . i could not believe how small the shrimp were.i can tell you that i am writing this review directly after eating my lunch from luke's and i am still hungry. not only was the shrimp roll insignificant and way to much money for what you get, but it was tasteless. the only good thing out of the entire meal was the new england clam chowder, and i have had better.i am sorry luke's lobster.you will have to make some changes before i ever darken your door step again.oh and by the way.do not believe the pics you see here on yelp, as images appear larger than they truly are.at least concerning luke's lobster anyway.good luck!"
2812,David L.,1114,1,6/24/15,"i like luke's lobster, but i hate this location. since the first tiny storefront opened in the east village opened a few years ago, i have been a regular at their various locations, and unfortunately, the one nearest where i actually live is my least favorite. by far. the employees are rude & inattentive. the employees are aloof & condescending. the employees are unhelpful & unapproachable. today was my last attempt."
2813,Jon S.,1114,1,6/19/15,"tried luke's lobster as i've heard good things about it from the hoboken community. went in, nice little shop with about menu options. i order the lobster roll. , which is standard for a lobster roll in nyc and surrounding areas. the roll is delivered to my table and it is literally a hot dog bun with lobster on it. no lettuce, no mayo, no french fries or cole slaw. it tasted very bland with the only condiment in the store being siracha. i finished the roll and then headed over to panera because i was left both hungry and unsatisfied. would not go again"
2814,John R.,1114,1,12/11/14,"if i could give less than one star, i would.the thing is, the food was ok.for appetizers, but for the fact that the portions are not even big enough for frodo baggins and the fellowship of the ring.if the price would have been a of what we paid.then ok. but for a grilled cheese and large clam chowder in a oz cup was a joke."
2815,Luke H.,1114,1,8/26/13,"i am absolutely shocked this place is rated so highly. this is so absurd that i had to create a yelp account to make my first review, upon stumbling upon how highly regarded this place is. months ago, i found several pieces of coarse, curly pubic hair sitting conveniently on the surface of my lobster roll. so plainly in view, there is no way this could not have been deliberate. i bring the food back to the counter to ask for it to be remade, but on hindsight, i definitely should have just asked for a refund.the employees tried their hardest not to bust out laughing when they saw the specimen. the price is ridiculous. especially considering the majority of the meat was lobster claw. i found zero lobster tail meat. what kind of lobster roll is that "
2816,J. J.,1114,1,7/7/13,elw expensive & long wait.no excuse for a lobster roll.
2817,Daniel A.,1114,2,11/1/18,"this place is overrated no flavor what so over! i've had way better lobster rolls for a better price. it is literally bread and lobster. really add mayo, tarragon, some spices, maybe some bacon to make it taste good. and the clam chowder tasted funny! the prices are also a little to much for a tiny sandwich! never again!"
2818,Anna X.,1114,2,9/20/18,"not very consistent in terms of preparation and taste. the last time i came here the rolls were on the spot, but this time they were really disappointing. the bread was cold and not buttery like it usually is. the crab meat was also not buttery and was just tasteless. i am having trouble finishing it as i type. sad cuz i've been craving it for a while, went out of my way to get it, and it did not even taste good. not something you would just throw away because of the price. very disappointed "
2819,Antonio S.,1114,2,7/13/18,"portions are tiny, waiting time is crazy long. i went in today and ordered a crab roll a small corn chowder and a glass of beer. it came to a total of . the roll was tiny and did not have much flavor. there was a fair amount of crab meat but it really was not seasoned. the corn chowder was tasty but again the portion was tiny for . the beer was ok. i do not know if i will go back, not sure it is worth the price or massive waste of time."
2820,Nelya K.,1114,2,5/22/18,"the rolls are tiny. our food came cold and slightly frozen. however, the lobster and crab tasted fresh and the slaw was yummy."
2821,Vivian L.,1114,2,3/11/18,"while visiting ny from los angeles san diego ca , my friend and i decided to try this place based on the great reviews. i saw quite a few that were hesitant about the price but frankly, for a lobster roll is pretty typical so, undaunted by the pricing, we went in with high expectations and boy were we sadly disappointed. it was the tiniest and blandest lobster roll i have ever had. the description told of the lobster being flavored lemon butter and their secret seasoning , but i did not taste any lemon, butter, or seasoning. i could not even taste any of the natural sweetness lobster meat usually has. and i'm not sure if this is typical of east coast lobster rolls but instead of the thick, buttery, toasty bread i'm used to, it just seemed like a regular slice of bread that was slightly toasted and used to wrap the lobster. i also got the clam chowder, which was flavored nicely, but the clam bits had the texture of having been frozen and thawed too many times. would not recommend this place nor would i want to come back for more."
2822,Katherine J.,1114,2,1/23/18,"my roommates and i were craving some lobster and mac and cheese one saturday night and saw how good the reviews were for luke's lobster. i've also heard about the chain a lot so thought this would be a good time to check it out and fulfill a craving.we all individually got our own lobster rolls and then shared a lobster mac and cheese. couple takeaways the good the mac and cheese was yummy, the noodles themselves were really good so bites without lobsters were still v delicious. i liked the crunch added on top so there was some texture instead of mush in your mouth. lobster in the lobster roll was generous and sweet. because they did not mask the lobster with lots of salt, butter, or mayonnaise like they usually do in lobster rolls, i felt that the restaurant definitely had some pride in the quality of their lobster. whenever i get something that is slathered in sauce or butter, i feel like they are hiding something.the bad to address my above point honestly the lobster rolls needed more seasoning. the bread def needed to be toasted with more butter, and the lobster itself actually could have benefited from more mayo butter and salt. while i appreciated the presentation of the lobster in such a simple way, it would have been way more delicious if the roll was more flavorful. the mac and cheese was tiny oh my god when it came out i actually just looked at it in shock.the ok, you are in fidi, you want a lobster roll and therefore you definitely know you are going to drop some on this meal. however for a lobster roll oh my goodness and it does not even come with anything also if you had to blow on a meal, i would recommend so many other places before eating a lobster roll so really only eat here to indulge a very specific lobster craving you should not be having. the mac and cheese was . . . . ok if this was a huge mac and cheese with tons of lobster, i would understand. but if i just ordered the mac and cheese alone without the lobster roll and just for myself, i would honestly be starving afterwards still. objectively i am not a big person nor do i have a huge appetite, but the portion was so tiny i was literally speechless from shock when it arrived.basically i'm not going to come back, unless i have a very specific craving for lobster again. not bad, but the portion sizes and eh flavor are not worth it for the price."
2823,Pet S.,1114,2,12/30/17,"teenytiny portions, you need four of their rolls to get any close to being full. expensive for the size. food was okay not great. i regret going."
2824,Lily Z.,1114,2,5/19/17,"i get this is ny and everything will be pricier, but spending for two people for mediocre food is not right. we ordered rolls, clam chowder, and drinks. i got the one where you can have a taste of the crab, lobster, and crab rolls. my husband got just the lobster roll. they were all incredibly small, and we left still feeling hungry. the lobster rolls on the east coast maine, boston are way better and the standard in terms of lobster rolls."
2825,Malena M.,1114,2,3/31/17,"slow slow slow, definitely not a quick lunch place. min lunch. got bisque instead of clam chowder. luke wherever and whoever you are, you need to come in and streamline this operation!!!"
2826,Damian M.,1114,2,2/5/17,a decent lobster roll but certainly not the stars it is rated at on yelp. very small portion for the hefty price. that is a pass for me.
2827,Guillaume T.,1114,2,1/29/17,"over ranked for plain lobster crab roles, with average flavors and quantities. not bad, not much!"
2828,Micah S.,1114,2,6/1/16,"ok i give up i have been ranting about underserving star reviews for long enough and now i get it it is me. stars means something to me and i'm always suspicious of a small number of reviews, all of which are stars, but this place has tons of reviews and a large balance are stars. my review will therefor not include fingerwagging for the star crowd who cannot possibly believe that stars should be reserved for the outlandishly awesome, never had better, value conscious nyc food consumer. yes, the d ] c cor is charming and the staff is very nice, but for a tiny lobster roll and a bottle of water with chips c'mon. to not mention the lack of bang for buck is to be someone who has money to burn i do not have that kind of dough, esp. for lunch. the options in this neighborhood for good great quality lunch at the same or similar price and, no less, at sitdown places with wait service are too many to be ignored. i know what lobster rolls are and if you have never had one you will always be disappointed at their lilliputian dimensions, but, still for a three bite lunch at a take away place with no meaningful seating is just beyond crazy to me. if you have got money to burn, light the fire. otherwise, take one step to the left for a delish and reasonably priced vietnamese sandwich, or walk half a block in any direction and your money will go farther for equal taste and d ] c cor. what lobster was in the bread was good that much has to be said."
2829,Chloe G.,1114,2,3/19/16,"i was so excited to try luke's lobster. i've heard only great things lobster is fresh, great selection, cool environment.when i walked in, i scanned the menu written on a black board on the wall . seemed like a good varietyrolls, grilled cheese, yum. after ordering, my food was ready in less than a minute i ordered the lobster roll combocomes with chips or slaw and a drink . the roll looked pretty good. the bread was nice and toasted, lobster was cold and had some type of seasoning sprinkled on top.first bite was okay lobster was a little bland. when i started to go in for my second bite, i noticed there were some weird milkycolored chunks of something.at first i thought it was a vegetable but after taking a bite of one it had a consistence like a super overcooked vegetable. i shrugged it off and picked those pieces out of the roll. next two bites had big pieces of lobster she will.not so fun to have to pick those out of my mouth. another bite had sand! totally turned me off and i could not continue eating the roll. i was so bummed because i heard such great things, and saw great reviews here on yelp.the slaw was okay.had a nice vinegary flavor. they have a great selection of sodai tried the blueberry honey lemonade, which i really enjoyed.i am not the type to be super picky about casual food, but the sand, she will, and mysterious milky white chunks were just not acceptable.overall i would not recommend this location, but am going to try another luke's lobster."
2830,Ebony C.,1114,2,2/6/16,"i've never had a lobster roll. it was disappointing. it was cold, bland, teeny portions and gave my entire family the runs. i have nothing else to really say about this place. it was a nice space but the food lacked flavor."
2831,Xiaoning F.,1114,2,10/2/15,ultra small size. dollars can buy me two great lobster tails and a bread and i can make a far more delicious one at home. still hungry after a meal.
2832,Matt P.,1114,2,9/19/15,"maybe i would not have been so disappointed if i had not gone to cull & pistol a few days earlier, but this just was not anywhere near as good. it was like the old joke the food here is terrible, and such small portions . a tiny bit of slightlyoff dishwatertasting lobster on a roll with a bag of chips. the staff seems vaguely annoyed that you have been rude enough to order food from them. it is cheaper than some of the other lobster roll places in ny, but not half as cheap and not half as good. luke's is to lobster what burger king is to steak."
2833,Katie F.,1114,2,9/2/15,"beware of unauthorized charges! the cashier at luke's lobster took the liberty of adding on a tip on my bill and a tip on my colleague's bill. they have a delicious lobster roll, but the unethical behavior left a bad taste in my mouth. if you do go here, i would strongly recommend paying with cash!"
2834,Kamran N.,1114,2,7/16/15,this is not a food review as we did not eat at this restaurant we wanted to have dinner and order noah arc with slaw but they did not have slaw and only other option was potato. as we were on diet we asked if we can have soup instead and she simply declined and did not offer alternatives. some level of flexibility and feeling welcome is something any decent restaurant should offer. we walked out disappointed mins ago and i felt so strongly about the arrogance that decided to write this review.
2835,Jill M.,1114,2,6/19/15,"i'm from maine, so maybe that explains it, but i was very disappointed with this lobster roll from the truck, so maybe better in the restaurant . it was not very flavorful and the butter had sort of condensed on the lobster. if you have never had lobster before, it would be fine, but i will not be coming back to the truck."
2836,Robert G.,1114,2,5/1/15,food was okay but for the price was not worth it. the lobster roll was petite to say the least. i would say it was the right portion for a toddler. not worth for a kids meal.
2837,J L.,1114,2,12/18/14,"a couple of my friends had been raving about luke's, so i decided to give it a try note this review refers only to the s. william st. location . i went in with the excitement of a rosyeyed yelp reader, expecting great things of their taste of maine sample platter, as so many before me had doneand enjoyed enough to become regular customers.boy was i disappointed.first off, these rolls are the size of a pig in a blanketand i mean kolaches, not your friendly barn animal. i could literally fit these sample bits in the palm of my hand. second, they were practically tasteless. try throwing some canned baby shrimp on a piece of buttered toastyou may get better results! actually, that roll in particular tasted more like a fishy salt lick than a sandwich. i could not believe the poor quality of these rolls. i've been to lobster shacks in maine and, believe me, they are not comparable. further, as someone who lived in boston for five years, believe me when i say steer clear of luke's if you are looking for an authentic maine lobster experience. eaters beware!"
2838,Rick A.,1114,2,11/3/14,"all the yelp ratings and hype were the reason why myself and other co workers decided to go . first of all , the size of the sandwich is the as long as your thumb for . secondly the lobster is cold i prefer it hot . for the quantity and price i do not think ill be ever going back . beware with all the reviewers may be ghost posters paid by the company.also, restaurant size is the same as my living room !!!"
2839,Prianka I.,1114,2,8/9/14,"i work in the area and have passed by this place many times while scouring for things to eat during my lunch hour. i'm not by all means a lobster roll connoisseur, but i was spoiled by the deliciousness of the lobster place in chelsea and have been struck by random cravings for lobster rolls lately. so why not splurge once in a while for lunch, right the restaurant is small and cozy, reminiscent of a new england lobster shack. i ordered a lobster roll, waited for about minutes then went on my merry way to devour this snack. to my utter disappointment, this snack did not live up the hype. the lobster was indeed fresh, but flavorless. it was also tinier than other lobster rolls i've had or maybe i'm delusional . i expected bursts of butter or whatever it is that they put in lobster rolls, but i tasted nothing i personally do not like the overly crisp buns, so that was an issue as well. honestly if i had this lobster roll as my first time i would not think lobster rolls are gifts from heaven. maybe this is what typical lobster rolls are like in maine plain and boring but i'm not a fan. i knew i was not going to be full from one, but i at least expected satisfaction! definitely not worth the expensive price."
2840,Paul I.,1115,5,6/26/18,"my fiancee and i were visiting new york city hopping around the city enjoying several libations and taking in the town us being california natives . suddenly, hunger struck like a villain of hell's kitchen deliberately trying to ruin our night. we instantly thought of ramen to be our hero. we took to instagram to poll our social audience to see which ramen spot they would recommend. overwhelmingly it was totto.totto luckily was around the corner and this is where our journey actually was just beginning. we started with some pork buns and sake. the sake was the perfect appetite wetter and the pork buns were very enjoyable. then, out of nowhere, we were blessed with a bowl of the mega paitan. it sported perfectly cooked al dente ramen noodles, chicken paitan, char siu pork, pork belly chunks, and a solft boiled egg.the broth was rich. the meat was tender. the egg was beautiful. great experience! highly recommend. thank you totto, thank you.cheers!"
2841,Trina V.,1115,5,5/19/18,"love it!this restaurant is pretty tiny. from what i can see, there is a handful of bar seats and couple of tables in the back. so be prepared to wait. i'm assuming the best time to go is right when they open both for lunch and dinner.write your name on the clip board and wait for them to take your order. like ramen parlor, you order while you wait and it is ready for you when you are seated.the bf and i got spicy pakistan you have a choice between pork and chicken. i ended up getting the pork. the broth does not look or taste spicy at first, but the spice definitely builds up. reminds me of the kind of spice you get from ramen parlor's lobster broth. mega paitan this one comes with char siu pork and pork belly. the char siu was delicious, but the pork belly was amazing. it just fell apart and melted in your mouth. bf loves daikokuya and he said it is comparable to their ramen.it is even better because it is a mix of the two ramen places that we love.overall, the broths, noodles, and meats were great. a definite must try if you are in the area."
2842,Tina C.,1115,3,9/3/18,"on labor day we were looking for a good ramen place. we chose toto to satisfy our craving. we arrived around pm, which is prime dinner time. unfortunately there was a line but i do appreciate how organized the wait was. they add your name to a list and will inform you when seating is available for your party.the restaurant is very small i think is the smallest ramen restaurant i have ever eaten at! there really is not really anywhere you can wait except on the sidewalk. the stoop right by the restaurant is a residential property which has a sign hanging, prohibiting sitting there. i do appreciate how they try to operate efficiently. while we waited we were given a menu so we could order ahead of time.our party of two was seated on the bar on tall stools. there were hooks behind us to hang up your coat. but there was no hook for my purse. i never place it on the floor so i had to awkwardly place it in my lap. the stool had no back, so i could not place it behind me as i was seated. when i looked into the back of the restaurant, i did not see that many tables. it was also very dimly lit this makes me sleepy!! lol .being seated at the bar meant that i had a great view of the kitchen. i like to watch people prepare food, so that kept me well entertained as i waited. we ordered the pork buns, and a bowl of ramen each. pork buns were a great appetizer moist pork rich in sauce flavor, with a nice soft bun. ramen was okay chicken bowl , portions are average but unfortunately the ramen did not impress me. i have heard great things about this establishment, but i tasted nothing that blew me out of this world. bathroom was hidden behind a sliding wooden door and was clean. overall just an okay experience. this is a cash only place as well, so bring the bills no apple pay, no credit cards ."
2843,Joe D.,1115,5,10/13/18,"totto is literally the greatest ramen i have ever had!me and my girlfriend have been there almost times, and every single time, the same order we always get extra spicy paitan with pork and a seasoned boiled egg, an avocado bun and a pork bun are amazing.the broth and whatever base is used has such a great taste. it is almost hard to explain.everything is always cooked perfectly, and the bowls are huge! the pork bun is phenomenal as well. i could eat !we will probably be back again next week."
2844,Kate E.,1115,4,6/17/18,"delicious!! + stars! i may update to as i complete my ramen tour. i view stars as the one to hit for a weekend so wait and see.went with the spicy chicken bowl but spice on the side and add the egg a must for all ramen! others in my party did the same order but included the spice. tip i think i got more because it was on the side. but the presentation is not as pretty so a trade off. definitely need the spice and standard amount is perfect. they have this down.bring cash and be prepared to eat somewhat quickly. it is all worth it, i promise!! the flavor is fantastic and we all agreed the best noodles we have ever had.tip i went on a saturday mid afternoon and there was no wait."
2845,Karen L.,1115,5,10/12/18,"ramen is my comfort food in my dictionary. i travelled to new york city, i absolutely want some japanese food. i searched totto ramen from yelp and their ratings are very awesome. so it took is to have minutes wait, we have highexpectation due to the waiting duration time. and it did not disappoint us at all. ramen is super delicious and it is good in size. i feel like i am in tokyo when i went into the noodle bar. the location is easy to find as a tourist of myself."
2846,Jess S.,1115,5,10/28/18,"i had the spicy chicken paitan. mushrooms added. and a sapporo. excellent flavors and portion size. i went solo around p on a sunday and was able to get in immediately at the bar. you write your name and partysize on a list outside the entrance. very tiny, cozy spot. the lines and wait are so long because of this and the popularity i suspect. the hostess and my waitress checked on me for a total of times, the perfect amount in my mind. cash only, great price points. check it out!"
2847,Long N.,1115,2,4/16/18,"let us start off with the bad and end good i guess.venue tiny, as most nyc places, it was cramped but not only that, they really try to squeeze you in there just to make that extra bowl of money. not the cleanest of places, grungy looking. the wait is always long, i've been multiple times, during the cold season they cannot even get a small heater outside for their waiting customers, that is how cheap they are.service what service ! it is all about cranky people in and out without any courtesy. the more bowls they can make the more money. we got sat in the far back corner with a shared table, that is great we get to make friends. the other folks ended up leaving so we scooted in so that the next group had a place to sit without moving in and out. we got told to move and forced us to literally sit in the walkway of an already cramped restaurant so not only did we not get to enjoy our meal fully, but people kept excusing themselves to move behind us constantly. i think that is a sign to cut down on the number of seats or expand the venue. the service was very rude when we brought up this idea as if it was absurd. we were trying to create less burden on all parties, they just wanted to make more seats for more money.payment it is unfortunately cash only. another inconvenience they purposefully choose as this saves them money, fees, new equipment, etc. we gave our cash and suppose to get back but instead they kept the and gave us back two s and a . so they expected us to give the as tip and they already kept the . the party next to us even noticed and thought it was absurd they would do that, at least break the if they wanted to keep the .ramen the best part of this experience was not even that great. i've been here once before and got a different bowl which was good, this time it was also good, but man was the char siu not at all tender. it was very tough in fact for everyone, so maybe it was the batch of pork but the soup at the end of the day was still delicious and i got the extra spicy ramen so got to spice up my broth as much as i wanted. food was a star but everything else was less hence the rating.honestly, next time we will go to ippudo around the corner for a larger space, much better service, and just as good of ramen, better apps! will not be back, happy eating."
2848,Mei L.,1115,3,7/24/18,"so my boss has been raving about this place as a place i have need to try as i am a big ramen fan, but i am a picky ramen fan. i usually have high expectations, as there are so many ramen places popping up, but i grade the bowl of ramen based on broth, noodles, toppings and service. i got the spicy paitan a with pork char shu.broth rich and creamy, had a good amount of flavor for being a chicken based compare to pork based ramen. noodles my ramen came with straight noodles, which i like as much as the curly, but it seems a little over cooked. at ippudo's, you can get it cooked a certain way and i like my noodles a little chewier. toppings it was topped with bran sprouts and green onions sliced the long way. i know that not all ramen places put the same toppings, but for the basic without add ons seems a little lacking. i would have like some bamboo shoots, wood ear mushroom, etc. the add on would have cost much more than the ramen itself . also it did not come with a ramen egg for the spicy one i got.additionally, the pork was a little dry for me and could have braised a little more but that is just me . service we got seated at the bar quickly and the server was super nice. we left a nice tip. i also did get the pork buns and it was braised well, but i do like ippudo's buns more.overall, the experience was good, and this place is a solid place to eat at price is good but when i compare it to other ramen places as a whole, it falls in my expectations a little. maybe if i get the chicken paitan without the spicy as the spicy has more pepper than spicy. i did taste it before mixing and the first sip without the spicy was delicious."
2849,Ileana M.,1115,3,5/30/18,"while i resent the fact that the soups come with very few toppings and that adding toppings makes the price skyrocket , this is certainly the best ramen broth i've ever had. i was smiling like an idiot at the first sip of my miso paitan it was that good. i was disappointed, however, that my egg was cooked through since i'm used to soft yolks in ramen.went on a sunday night at around and waited for about minutes party of . they took our order in line so we got to eat almost as soon as we sat down.long story short, do not go for good toppings or a good ambiance. go for that good broth."
2850,Annette L.,1115,5,5/5/18,"wowww totto ramen really surprised me.btw this is the original and totto ramen next door is the tonkotsu sister restaurant.honestly i was skeptical about eating chicken ramen bc i've only had tonkotsu aka pork being from california & spoiled with menya ultra and orenchi . the sound of chicken ramen sounded. healthy cringe but i was very wrong. it was amazing. a must try when in nyc.food extra spicy chicken paitan with chicken, option of chicken meat or pork ~ a perfect bowl of ramen! the spicy sauce similar to a saute sauce comes on the side. the soup was flavorful with a balance between salty and fatty on the lighter side of fat compared to tonkotsu but will not leave you feeling heavy . the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente ask if you want more cooked . the chicken was sooooooo good. it was not dry at all but it was not too salty or fatty either. please teach me how to cook my chicken like this ah.miso paitan comes with half a boiled egg, ground pork, bean sprouts, and a choice of char siu or chicken. was not as huge of a fan of this one because i felt like the miso flavoring was not strong enough for me. but the egg was amazing. i would definitely add this to my ramen.sapporo bottled was hoping for draft ~ service amazing service with smiles everywhere ! wait on wednesday for a table of at pm was minutes.ambiance casual with dim lighting. small place with a ramen bar and about side tables for slightly larger parties not good for tables of + ."
2851,Annie L.,1115,3,4/30/18,"came here a few months back during my nyc trip. arrived on a thursday night around pm and there was a line out the door already. put our names on the waiting list and about mins or so we got seated inside. after all the hype i decided to try it out and it was aok. i think i'm spoiled by all the good ramen places out here in the bay area that this was just ok.i ordered the miso paitan which included ground pork, half boiled egg, scallions, bean sprouts, onions and char siu. i paid extra to add some tofu. broth was steaming hot which was perfect for cold weather. noodles were plentiful but it stops there. there was no wow factor just a quick bowl of ramen that got lost in the shuffle of all the other hundreds of bowls of ramen that i have had. also ordered fried oysters and a plate of curry rice over chicken. both items were ok.service was quick as this is a quick in and out type of place. asked for a coke which never came. super busy so hard to have severs that are attentive. this is also cash only, a little inconvenient but there is an atm right next door. unfortunately will not be back."
2852,Vishal P.,1115,4,7/27/18,"pretty much my go to ramen spot when i'm in the area.i love their steamed pork buns. what i love about their ramen is that their soup base is very flavorful. i always get something spicy. any ramen bowl can be made extra spicy! top it off with a boiled egg, bamboo shoots and scallions! so good!"
2853,Qme Z.,1115,5,3/23/18,"i came here with my boyfriend a little before they opened for dinner around . there was already a group of about people waiting in front of us. we put our name down on the list and then was given a menu to place our orders before they seated us. we were seated at which is when they open, and had already placed our orders at the stand in the front.we ordered the mega ramen and the spicy ramen. both with creamy and savory broths. i wish the ramen was more al dente, but still delicious. good size chashu with the ramen unlike other places. i was definitely full off the one bowl of ramen. i also ordered the pork baos but found them to be underwhelming, next time i will stick with the ramen only."
2854,Megan T.,1115,4,10/21/18,"this is my favorite place to get ramen. it is so delicious i cannot even. be ready to wait outside for about minutes though because it is busy every hour of the day and every day of the week. they have a good system where you order outside before you get in so the tables open up quick, but they also expect you to leave right after you are finished eating. do not go here planning to have a slow meal. very delicious i just wish they would open a larger seating area so the dining experience could be more enjoyable!"
2855,Edwin P.,1115,5,2/19/18,"when my girlfriend and i were planning our weekend getaway to nyc, this was one of the places we knew we had to hit up, so we planned that after going to broadway, we would come here for dinner and we did.located on a side street in midtown hell's kitchen , we came here after seeing anastasia. this a nofrills place but even at pm the line was out the door. the concept is pretty simple. you write your name down on a paper outside the door and how many in your party and you grab a menu. promptly the hostess will come and take your order while you wait for your seat. after a minute wait we were seated and not even minutes from when we were seated, we were served our ramen bowls. we both ordered the spicy paitan with chicken. the ramen was served in a ridiculously large and deep bowl, and being outside in degree weather with rain, this was such a comfort food that we gladly slurped it and finished it.as stated before, this a no frills place, so you order, eat and pay. this is not the place you want to stay too long, due to the long lines and the size of the restaurant, but if you do get the chance, try it.oh and also, cash only."
2856,Sadie A.,1115,5,11/4/18,"i went here while visiting new york, and i was very pleased with everything. i got the chicken ramen and it was amazing."
2857,Crystal M.,1115,5,8/9/18,the first time i tried to come here there was a long line outside and i said no thanks. but then i decided to come on a thursday for dinner and although very small. the ramen was amazing. i got the extra spicy chicken taipan. and it was great. the extra spicy sauce on the side was the perfect touch. i will definitely be back again!
2858,Marilu F.,1115,5,2/16/18,"we booked a trip to nyc and wanted to know what the hot spots were. i happened to find totto ramen as i was looking for a place to eat after watching anastasia on broadway. given that it kept popping up on many lists, i had friends who had visited it on yelp, and that it was close by, affordable, and something that there is not a lot of in miami, we went for it.totto ramen is underground. you essentially go in the entrance, go downstairs, and sign your name. waiting is outside unless it is not packed and you have a little area by the stand that you can wait. when you write your name, make sure to include however many people are in your party and make sure everyone is present. they will not sit you if you have people in your party missing.anyway, take a look at the menu and get ready to order. the hostess takes your order while you wait. once you finally get let inside, you are led to a table or to the bar area where you see the employees cooking, pulling noodles by hand and the like. it is pretty interesting and the employees there are super nice. they answer questions about the process, and in general, just want you to enjoy your food. that is another thing, too, the food is almost immediately placed on the table once you are finally sat. this is a no frills, let us eat, pay, and get out of here restaurant.the place is ridiculously small. you really want to enjoy your meal without rushing. still, do not overstay your welcome. other guests want a shot at the ramen, too, and let me tell you it is worth it. we waited minutes in raining cold and i was so happy when i finally had my spicy paitan with chicken. note that the boyfriend got the same and we ate happily, our bellies full. we were probably in the last group of the night as this place closes at midnight and we were there around pm or so.i saw people order a variety of dishes from pork buns to mega bowls, but what really stands out here is the chicken paitan. have it spicy or not spicy, big or small, but have it. you will have no regrets and it definitely hits the spot after a long and arduous day. add the weather being subpar and it is a recipe to get you smiling. be aware that this is not the only location. there are several around town, this one just happened to be the one we went to. oh, and if you speak japanese all the better, even if it is just to say thank you. if the staff was nice before, they are even nicer when you show them you appreciate their hard work.pretty sure, too, this has been covered, but i will say it again. there is one just last thing that you need to know cash only."
2859,Serena J.,1115,5,4/4/18,"the mega paitan is the way to go. comes with three varieties of pork so you can try them all! it will put you in a ramen coma. i was a bit apprehensive about trying it because i thought chicken broth would be a bit bland, but i'm glad they used chicken broth because otherwise, i think all that pork would have killed me. the shredded pork, garlic, and other garnishes make this broth extremely heavy in a good way , and i think you could easily split this bowl with someone else.the place itself is a very chic holeinthewall type place. it reminds me of ramen places in japan, but like, american hipsterfied. really cool place to grab dinner. beware of the wait i came early, but there was a bit of a line when i left.there is a place next door that seems to be the same restaurant, but with tonkatsu broth. i might give it a try next time i'm in the area."
2860,Melinda H.,1115,5,8/31/18,"oh how i love this place! this is one of our mandatory stops when we come to nyc and i'm sure i put that in each of my previous reviews here, but i'm serious! this place will not let you down! you are missing out if you do not try this! it is perfect!! seriously the best ramen i've ever had and the place that taught me what ramen should taste like. if you need to know what correct ramen is, how it should taste & be served then come here if you cannot make it to japan. the menu is limited, but you can add items to your bowl. you can also get extra noodles if you run out before your broth. also do not forget to sign in when you first get there since there is always a wait. enjoy, i know i do!"
2861,Jaime B.,1115,5,11/2/18,really great!! very small place but ramen is amazing. great flavor. big plates. highly recommended.
2862,Aaron R.,1115,5,10/7/18,so good. this place does not mess around. the noodles were firm and fresh. dub step music in the background was the perfect compliment to the meal! highly recommend.
2863,Jay G.,1115,3,7/14/18,"i got the most famous ramen they have and the soup was so sick! i did not like at much but it had a lot of meat and ramen was good, the staff are nice so i'm giving it a star"
2864,Mimi T.,1115,4,1/18/18,"totto ramen is a small ramen shop. at first glance, it seems that is mostly counter seating, but there are tables in the back. we were seated at a high table. the staff here are really friendly and made sure everything was okay throughout our meal.the ramen seems to be chicken broth, and is quite yummy.+miso paitan this seems to be the chicken paitan soup with a ball of miso in the middle this is great so i could mix in however much i want. i actually really liked the rich broth so i only mixed in about of the miso. the noodles were a nice chewy texture. i also chose to add pork instead of chicken , which was tougher than i prefer my chashu but definitely meatier. the scallions were delicious and added texture.the ramen was tasty, especially for the cold day. my friends also really enjoyed their drinks! just keep in mind that this is a cashonly establishment. all in all, a yummy ramen shop!"
2865,Vy T.,1115,5,1/13/18,"wow, just wow! we were deciding between this place or the other popular ramen place down the block and are pretty happy with our decision!!! great smiley service and real japanese people cooking d!tip the best tip i can give you is to write your name down, ask how long the first person in line has been waiting and then do something else buy gloves maybe for the suggested wait time xd. it did not even feel like we had to wait for mins!!!! two different kind of noodles, make sure you ask foe the one you want. there is that yellow egg noodle my preference and the white buck like flour noodle. i did not ask and got the latter."
2866,Sam L.,1115,5,3/13/18,"been here many times and to other ramen shops in the area, and i think this is one of my favorites. if you come during peak hours, you could wait for about minutes but their service is fairly quick.during a busy time, you need to walk up to the front and put your name down. when it is almost your turn to be seated, they will come to you with their menu so they can take your order before you are seated. once you are seated, the ramen comes out in just a few minutes.i have ordered multiple items on their menu, but i think their spicy paitan is my favorite. the extra spicy paitan is not that much spicier and i like the flavor of the spicy sauce compared to the extra spicy sauce. the ramen comes with a lot of green onions. if you do not like green onion, make sure to ask for none. if i remember correctly, the miso ramen just comes with a dollop of miso paste on top and you need to mix it in.the broth is really nice. it has the perfect consistencyit is not too thick where it is super heavy and it is not too thin to where the broth does not hang onto the noodles. i would describe the broth as peppery. the noodles are also nice and chewy!if you are lucky or not , you will be seated at the bar and you can watch them make each bowl of ramen if you are into that. you can see them use the torch to char the meat right before serving it, cook the noodles and add all the toppings. they have it down to a science.reading multiple reviews, i have seen many negative ones where their staff demanded more tip than what was given, which has yet to happen to me since i usually give the typical amount of tip. just keep this in mind when coming."
2867,Richard H.,1115,1,8/26/18,"i would avoid this establishment if possible. i'm surprised at the high review. food sucks and service blows.the most popular ramen is expensive costing for a bowl. broth is thick, super oil heavy, and on the very salty side. prepare to drink cups of water from this salt soup and have on speed dial for the possibility of a heart attack after your meal.the saddest part of their place is their service. these servers are rude. they just do not give a f ck about you. they know they will get customers because of their high reviews so they go in with this entitled mentality. they provide no service beside bringing out your meal. you need to constantly flag the waiter to refill your water. with such sh tty service, they expect a % tip. worse of all, they will stop you, haggle you, and embarrass you for leaving a tip not worthy of what they think they should get. and for the record, we kindly left a % tip to be nice when we should of left them with nothing. and they still had the nerve to stop you and tell you that the tip was not enough. what kind of restaurant does that it is so sad the owner approves of their behavior and reading from other people's reviews, it seems like this behavior has been going on for awhile."
2868,Tiffany K.,1115,3,9/19/18,i love ramen and i've had amazing ramen from the freezer aisle from sun ramen. and i think that was better than totto. it could have been that it was hot and humid outside and totto does not offer great air conditioning but i found the ramen just ok. luckily we did not have to wait to be seated which was nice!
2869,Brandon P.,1115,5,3/11/18,"so when the wife and i came there today on sunday we were met with a huge wait line, and there was a place right next door that was the same thing but pork broth which is the same people. but in japan i agree it is pork that is the original. but, i just had to try the chicken broth to see what everyone else was eating. so it came time for us to order, we had the number and number wow great taste from that broth and nice spice from the green onion and the nice flavor on that pork!sweet mother of jesus those bowls were pretty spicy even without that extra spicy oil.we loved every bite. thank you so much!!!"
2870,Anjeline R.,1115,4,9/3/18,we usually go to the other totto ramen location in hell's kitchen but this was closer to our hotel. it was hella busy right as it opened but they seated us fairly quickly. it is efficient that they take your order beforehand so it is ready when you get seated. everything was great but i think the hell's kitchen location is better. not sure why but the flavors there were better. still it was absolutely yummy and glad i went!
2871,Hui L.,1115,3,6/7/18,"i did not know i could love chicken paitan i consider myself a tonkotsu ramen fan but totto's make have convinced me otherwise.came here for an early dinner as it is going to be my last week working in this area and did not have to wait long for a seat by the kitchen. yeah the stools have no backs and there are also no hooks for bags or anything so i just held my bag. it was cool watching the chefs at work while they put together the ramen bowls and stir the hot giant pots of soup bases. they do add some kind of special sauce or oil from a brown jar before adding in the rest of the components of the dish. maybe it adds flavor i went with the classic chicken paitan with chicken instead of pork which i later regretted . they also offered this dish with miso but i wanted to taste the chicken soup on it is own with any influences from other umami flavors. i'm totally fine with few toppings.my bowl came out in about minutes. the chicken had the consistency of slightly softer chicken breast meat. definitely should have gotten the pork char siu instead. the noodles were soft. i did not really get or care for the raw onions on top and chopped scallions. the soup is definitely the star of the bowl. i did not know chicken broth could taste so good! it is almost almost on par with the richness of tonkotsu broth! towards the bottom of the bowl though, it gets a bit grainy. as in tiny pieces of shredded chicken have sunk to the bottom and the last bit of soup you want to drink has the texture of drinking some poorly mixed powdered drink.so verdict tried it. but tonkotsu broth still wins."
2872,Tommaso M.,1115,4,1/7/18,"delicious. delicious. delicious.they have locations, one next to the other. the first one serves ramen with chicken broth, and the other serves pork broth. i decided to go with th to pork one.i tried their mega charsiu tonkotsu ramen and i am still drooling at the thought of that huge bowl of magic. the texture of their noodles is perfect. the broth is very tasty but not too salty meaning you can actually finish it! . the fried garlic is among the best i have ever tried. and the pork is so soft and juicy that the only comment is oh my. !the only complaint is the loud music and the fact that since there is always people waiting, you are served quickly and they try to make you go away as soon as you are finishing your meal. other than that which is understandable, given the size of the place , a highly recommended ramen spot in manhattan!"
2873,June C.,1115,5,6/30/18,"it is my second time tried toto ramen. the first time i tried at the second store located at st street, which is bigger store and have tables inside. because there was a long line at the original toto ramen store located at nd street. this time i tried at the original store and i came here at am and got a seat at the bar very soon. there are only a bar at the original ramen store and that is why it is always a line. i ordered their most popular mega ramen this time. it surprised me there are so many kinda of meat inside. definitely it worths . but also i think there are too many meats in one ramen and the soup becomes not so pure and smooth. last time i ordered the original one , the soup was quite good and rich. it depends on what you want. the waiter and waitress at the original store are both very sincerely. both are awesome experience."
2874,Nathaniel P.,1115,5,7/23/18,"had the mega paitan ramen and the original. probably best thing i've eaten all year it is february but whatever broth is very thick and there is a depth of flavor i've not had before in ramen. its reminiscent of a chicken noodle soup. i enjoyed the fresh onions and scallions in the soup it helped cut through the rich and salty broth. if you get the original, i encourage you to order an egg it is worth the two bucks. excited to come back and try their other ramen options.service is quick. there are limited seats and lots of people to accommodate so there is a very efficient turn over of customers."
2875,Megan W.,1115,4,1/11/18,"although the prices seem relatively high ~ for a smaller sized bowl of ramen, the broth is very thick and filling. i ordered the extra spicy paitan with pork, but got the spice on the side. the dish was very fragrant and flavorful, but i would recommend getting the spice on the side because it can be very spicy. next time, i would request a smaller amount of green onions next time, since the amount was overwhelming.the char siu pork bun was extremely juicy and soft, and the flavor was very sweet. i would refrain from this dish if you are not a fan of oily greasy foods. i personally thought that the amount of mayonnaise was slightly overwhelming. at the price of . for and . for , i do not see myself ordering this often.as a small ramen shop, totto ramen is relatively busy, even right before close. however, the workers are very friendly and do their best to accommodate your party in a timely manner. my party of four was given a thirty minute wait time, but we were seated and served within the next fifteen minutes!"
2876,Steph Y.,1115,4,12/19/17,"damn the line here is always long, i have yet to see no line here but it is worth the wait i have only come around lunch time, so it may be worse during dinner time . typically my party size is not so large either so that definitely helps. plus, you can pretty much know what you are going to order even before you go in since there are menus for everyone to look at outside.i must say, they are pretty efficient and getting customers in and out while providing good service. the staff members are always checking up on customers to see if they enjoyed their food.totto is good, but not as good as i remembered. but to be honest, i do not know if it is because i've eaten so much ramen in my life now that my standards have gone up. i also ordered a different dish last time chicken paitan which was much smaller and lighter than their best seller, the mega paitan! that is what i ordered this time, it was really good but i'm just at that point of my life where i probably should not be eating that much because ramen is extremely filling, lots of fats & carbs but i did eat the whole thing and was in a food coma shortly but i know better next time to order a smaller bowl.i will always come back here as the service is great, prices are reasonable and definitely on a cold day "
2877,Rebecca L.,1115,3,6/25/18,"i've been here a couple of times and originally i would give it starts, but since my last visit, i would say i've downgraded it to stars.if you stick with the pork ramen, it is pretty decent, but i made the mistake of ordering chicken on my last visit i figured the brand had a rooster, so they must be known more for chicken . never again. chicken was really dry. not sure if it was just a bad bowl, but i'm going to stick with pork from now on."
2878,Amber K.,1115,5,2/6/18,"i usually have pork based broth's when i get ramen so i was a little skeptical about totto ramen when i learned it was all chicken based. i thought it usually did not carry as much flavor, but boy was i wrong.i guess my first clue to how good it was should have been the line to get in at around pm on a sunday night. my group had to put our name down on a master list and wait outside, but i will say they were very efficient in terms of getting people in and out fast. they take your order even before you get seated so they know what to bring you as soon as you sit down.i got the pork buns to start, which were super cheap for and tasted amazing. honestly probably some of the best i've had in terms of flavor, size, and juiciness. i got the chicken paitan for my ramen bowl which was chicken broth with pork meat as a topping and a soft boiled egg to add. the broth was very rich, fatty and almost buttery, which i love when it comes to ramen. the other toppings were pretty typical and nothing too special, so the broth is what really stole the show.overall i loved totto ramen and definitely will come again, just maybe not at such a crowded time. the prices were so cheap for such a popular place. just wish there was more seating since i ended up sitting on a small stool that stuck out into the aisle a bit, but that is okay when you are eating great food!"
2879,Leslie T.,1115,4,5/29/18,"people have been raving about totto ramen forever and it was good, but honestly nothing too special. i realize that most people order the chicken paitan and i opted for classic tonkotsu. maybe that is why i was only satisfied and not impressed but i was happy about the price, especially it was just as if not slightly less yummy compared to ippudo and other ramen places in the area. definitely better than mentoku where people go if totto's wait is too long haha . after tax and tip it came out to and i left full and satisfied. came at pm on the saturday of memorial day weekend and there was no wait last time i had wanted to go was dinner on the saturday of labor day and the wait was . hours. so got to try your luck "
2880,Kim J.,1115,1,10/24/18,"what kind of establishment has workers who follow you outside demanding a tip, as if the service deserved a tip! they are out of their fucking minds and lucky i did not get out of character and slap the shit out of him. disgusting, no words, tip is not an obligation, and i grabbed my wallet to leave a tip but then i thought, wait why would he have to say it so arrogantly . so i said forget this, there was nothing good about this service and this disgusting disgrace for human life decides it is appropriate to follow me outside of the restaurant demanding i tip. look, the ramen was mediocre, the service was equivalent to mc donalds. save your time & money! no wonder their competitors next door are thriving!!"
2881,Smarter t.,1115,1,9/15/18,staff is terrible. remember that you are an employee. customers keep your doors open. you are no longer the only ramen shop in town.a disgrace to the people of japan. a slap in the face to the people of new york city.and all your other locations have lost the quality in their broth. pffft!bakayaro!!
2882,Blue B.,1115,1,9/7/18,"this was a few months ago. the food was good but i hate the customer service there. me and my friend went to celebrate birthday but there was an waiter ruined our happiness. he missed our order caused my friend to wait another mins because they just started to cook. this waiter showed discriminatory attitude toward asian guests and his name is naroto. when we talked to him said you missed the order. he said we did not order it. he blamed us for his mistake. come on man, bring your brain to work. we ordered a combo paitan ramen and salmon roll and an extra spicy ramen, but you only served salmon roll and extra spicy ramen. do not you ever think about the meaning of combo the worst thing was no explanation, no excuse and no apologize. he even shook his hand to us in the back and thought we did not see it.i love the food there but will not go anymore."
2883,Stone Y.,1115,1,8/27/18,"i've been to so many ramen restaurants. this is pretty average ramen place. if consider the pricing, environment and service, it is under average. do not understand it goes viral and popular. broth wise, it is way too salty, which is not drinkable, what so ever. the environment is a joke. ac was installed way back in the place. you would have to sweat a lot while you eat, which is not enjoyable. would not recommend if you have high expectation on both quality and quantity. overall it is way overpriced. feel sorry for new yorkers. they have to spend so much time in queue to eat mediocre bowl of ramen. never ever put it in your bucket list if you are traveling, not worth wasting time at all."
2884,Mickey H.,1115,1,8/26/18,"absolutely rude cashier! i will explain at the end.if you desire clogged up arteries, then this is your spot! just had dinner and ordered bowls of ramen of their best seller and of their miso based bowl. not only was the broth for all bowls beyond super oily, thick and high in sodiumx , i had to constantly ask for water refills to help dilute my palette. it would have been nice if the servers were acute to their surroundings to not constantly flag them for refills for their salty af meal! terrible service and even terrible employees.so let me begin by explaining my headliner why my experience here was beyond subpar. let us start off with educating the owner and the male cashier of this place that tip is discretionary based on your experience. there is no mandatory or minimum required percentage by law, it is only a suggested percentage. i was actually stopped by the cashier after payment because they did not get their % desired tip that they were looking for. well, look here buddy, i can pay what i want to pay. how dare you come at me and tell me there is a mandatory percentage and lie to my face like that to scam me like i was a foreigner not knowing that system screw your business and f k the male cashier. too bad i did not get your name to blast you for your unethical behavior. consider the additonal i gave you as a charity donation to your high cholesterol establishment. perhaps you can use that money to educate yourself the definition of tip. conclusion stay away from this place. disgusting noodles and even more vomiting of a business with shady ass workers.again, rarely do i give out a star rating but this place deserves stars. too bad that is the min i have to give to post for a review. you are lucky you even get a star to begin with."
2885,Vu T.,1115,1,8/23/18,"if i could give this place zero stars i would. one of the items we ordered was pork buns, the pork was so dry and overcooked that it was impossible to even chew. we were disappointed but we figured okay let us just go to a different spot after we finish. i was not even going to write this review until our waiter was completely rude. before i could even finish signing my name on the bill, he told us i need you to leave we have other customers waiting. never coming back."
2886,Owais K.,1115,1,8/20/18,"the main reason this is a star is because of customer experience. will not repeat or recommend to family and friends.food decent, noodles were soft and the chicken was cooked to the right temperature. broth would need some improvement. but it is not something that i will want to try again.customer service worst, rude waitress. illogical store policy simply trying to loot tourists.pros do not have to wait long for the food to come out.decent food portion.cons cash only businesssmall seating arrangements.stupid store policy. order per customer even if the customer is a year old baby.detail i took a weekend trip to nyc with my wife and year old. around pm we were craving some ramen and i found this place over yelp. looked pretty good with stars and over reviews. the place was very small but all tables and counter tops was taken and the business was running good. had to wait mins before we got a table.we got seated and were handed the menu, when the waitress came over to take the order she said that 'as per store policy i need to order minimum dishes since we are people'. wait a minute are you counting a year old baby as an adult well i ended up wasting around on something which was left untouched while he sat there watching cartoons on the phone. i ordered the mega paitan while my wife ordered spicy paitan and if you are wondering what i got for my son it was an avocado bun . while taking the order the waitress let us know that they do not accept cards its cash only and the bill would be around . let us stop and check the calendar to see which year we are in, last i saw it was . i asked my wife and she said she has around with her i never carry any cash its only my debit card and drivers license .we finished our food and it was time to pay the bill. so i asked my wife to give me the money and to our surprise when she looked inside her purse she only had . i felt bad that i did not have enough money to tip the waitress so i called her over and said that i do have the money to pay the bill but not enough to tip her and if there was any other way to swipe my card. to my shock this was her response you knew how much the bill was before eating . i do not think i have to explain what she meant here."
2887,Jimmy C.,1115,1,8/3/18,"worst experience ever, waiter ask you to sign your name all by yourself, on a piece of paper nobody is watching, really i only come because i thought this is a typical overrated ramen house for white people so at least the service will be okay, but well, you cannot even relay on that."
2888,Franky P.,1115,1,8/1/18,"unpleasant experience here starting from the food, quality of customer service, and the sanitation. the ramen noodles ordered had the kind of odor and taste that you do not get from clean ramen broths st other japanese ramen restaurants. i could not eat it. also the temperature here is maintained at degrees so be prepared to sweat and feel uncomfortable during your whole time here in the summer heat. the waitress was not attentive and was flirting with other employees here. not helpful. not recommended."
2889,Olivia P.,1115,1,7/31/18,"this is a scam. it is a giant tourist trap. the staff are actually nasty and extremely rude. they yell at you if you do not leave enough tip! the food is beyond mediocre. it is one big, joke, and the joke is on you if you pay money here.i hope it closes down as soon as possible."
2890,Eeewwe D.,1115,1,6/27/18,"i was instructed to sign my name at the front clipboard, however, it seemed like the main usher did not even care to look at the board and when the customers that came after us pointed out that we were here before them, the usher just gave himself a shrug, did not apologize and just replaced us with the group that was kind enough to point out the mistake. after we sat down the food came in less than minutes. broth was thick and rich, however, the noodles were undercooked. it might have been the noodles or something else, but i ended up with a severe case of digestive issues within minutes. i know that this place is popular and busy, but i was kind of embarrassed spending dollars eating a bowl of ramen with my wife receiving below average quality food and service. i have heard lots of good things about this place and i hope this does not happen to anyone else that visits this shop."
2891,Rob H.,1115,1,6/25/18,"if i could give this place zero stars, i would. the restaurant is garbage. the food is mediocre. the staff has a nasty attitude problem. i do not understand the hype about this place at all. you are better off going to ippudo on w st."
2892,Hong L.,1115,1,6/18/18,"it is very bad experience for this popular ramen though the food is not bad. first at all, when we outside and the guy came and told they only accept cash. not very bad for this but still not good for customers who like to use digital money like us. secondly, and this is the most important issue for here, we are party of four and are kids with age and . when we ordered and we planned to order ramen and appetizers and the guy told and pointing to the menu we must to order ramen per customer that of course including all the kids. fair ! never heard this. because of this and we have to order ramen only without the appetizers since we have no way to finish all with kids. and the guy looks very unhappy since we only order ramen. finally, when we paid and dropped of the tips and the lady came to the table and checked how many we left for the tips though we are still sitting. the funny thing is the lady asked us for why we rips under %, just shorter because we are not very happy with the guy force us to order ramen. after we questioned her back is this required the tips must be %+ and the answer is whatever the customers like to do. all these made us have a very bad experience with this location. i know my review will be nothing here inside the k plus reviews but just want to tell what i think and this is my first review in yelp."
2893,Lucy Y.,1115,1,6/9/18,"ramen was ok, but their horrible service made me speechless.first, i ordered the extra spicy miso paitan and thought it might be too spicy for me. so i asked for a small plate politely and took some spices and a little portion of the scallions out onto the plate. this waitress stood next to me and meanly angrily accused me that if i did not want scallions, i should have told them earlier. she even said it twice loudly. so rude. i was embarrassed but shook because i like to eat scallions but they put too much in my bowl covering the noodles and broth so i wanted to take some out. plus i just did not want my ramen to be too spicy so i had to took some spices out too is that something unreasonable to do that you had to act like that it is entirely my freedom to do whatever i want with my ramen, no anyway, i did not say anything to her and kept on eating.meanwhile, since my bf and i were seated under the ac, i was facing the wind and cold air for the whole time. it got way too cold, and my chest felt really uncomfortable so i asked another waitress to adjust the ac she did it happily friendlily and i appreciate that!the ramen i ordered was mediocre did not like the flavor so you know, i was not really satisfied with my overall experience.when it comes to the check, i did not want to give % bc of the first waitress's attitude and put % down. she, the same lady^, counted the cash in front of us and threw it back, be like tips are not included & you gave too little in a horrific attitude. me and my bf were shook honestly, if your service was good enough i would have gave you % or more. and i have the rights to give how much i want depending on the service not mandatory or at a fixed rate. now she has the decency to demand for more tips very unprofessional. she got so angry after i explained why i would not give more, took the money and stormed out.this lady makes me not want to go back to totto ramen ever again in my entire life. and i will not lol."
2894,Yipeng D.,1115,1,6/6/18,"the server let us waited for a table for for minutes, and then told us we can only sit at the bar. when we request a formal table he refused with no reasons. terrible service, would never come again!"
2895,Daniel N.,1115,1,6/4/18,"this is my first time in new york and i was looking for something to eat near times square that had good ratings. i happened to stumble upon totto and was intrigued by how high the rating was and decided to come for dinner. however, i had the miso ramen for and a side of spice, which was for something so small and that caught me by surprise. the quality of the broth was okay and seemed to be really rich making it thicker than most broths. the spice was not spicy at all so i recommend not wasting your money on the extra spice and just go for the extra spicy if you want spicy. unfortunately, the reason why i'm giving this one star rating is because of the tipping system. i was not given the proper amount of service by the server and she had the audacity to force me to tip more than i should have. she personally stopped us and asked for more, even stopping my friend from leaving without tipping. i am really disappointed in this restaurant because of their actions."
2896,Debbie d.,1115,1,5/30/18,"this place, compared to ippudo, is average. the buns ea are good, the ramen is not. ordered their chicken paitan , tasted average. the mega paitan at tasted average too. every small addition to the ramen, like half egg and spices are extra . went here a week ago, no a c, crazy hot inside. and they really rush you to get out. do not forget your cash, and tip %, the japanese servers are so onpoint with their math that they confront you on the spot if you are missing a few cents to make the % mark which is not deserved given the sweaty ambience and rushed service ."
2897,A M.,1115,1,5/26/18,"this onestar review is in reference to the customer service. i went with a friend a while ago and the host waiter stopped us for an extra tip. this establishment asks you to order in advance so you are in and out to avoid waiting times for other patronshence, limited patron waiter interaction. i thought it was petty since this place is highly popular and would not have problems getting business and tips. if you want to try the ramen, i would suggest go ahead. if you are expecting good customer service, then i would have a hard time recommending this place."
2898,Ang F.,1115,1,5/18/18,"for ramen, i give it a star. for the waitress that provided no service yet demanded for more tips, to the extend of using calculator and told us that people usually give % when we have given % is way rude. we would have tip more. but the waitress simply turns me off."
2899,CJ R.,1115,1,1/27/18,"i was about to rate this place stars, but what happened the last minute as i was about to leave made me so furious that this place does not deserve my star.ramen was good, do not get me wrong, but i had better. for me, the music was playing way too loud that i could not carry a normal conversation. the water that they served us had some traces of lint.i tipped the amount that takes into consideration of the food, service, and cleanliness. as i was about to leave, one of the waitresses tapped me on the shoulder, pulled me to the side, and informed me that i tipped too little and demanded i tipped the %. i told her that tips are optional, not mandatory. she did not stop after that and urged me pay the remaining percentage. she basically this establishment is so unprofessional and inconsiderate. if you want the gratuity to be mandatory, then enforce it and apply it to the receipt.take note if you come here, make sure you have enough money to pay % for tips. if not, prepare to get harassed. you do not believe me on the search within the reviews section, type 'tips' and you will see hundreds of bad experiences from other yelpers who ate at this disgraceful restaurant."
2900,Jorge C.,1115,1,1/24/18,"where do i start. i've been hearing about this place for over a year and finally, i decided to give it a shot. i came in here with an empty stomach and was ready to feast. first i ordered pork buns and when i took a bite of it, it felt as if i bit into a baconator from wendy's. the amount of fat and oil that dripped looked like an oil shipwreck. then i ordered the chicken ramen and was beyond disappointed. my first impression of my chicken ramen was eh, but i endured on. not giving up on the ramen i gave it chance after chance believing it will get better however, it never did. i would not give this to my dog because she goes to ippudo or ramen ya."
2901,Kelli B.,1115,1,1/13/18,"server stopped us before leaving telling us we tipped too little and they wanted more. however, they left out our side orders main items in our . base ramen bowls and accused us of eating them when we let them know & asked for our missing items. i'm sorry, you are lucky i even left a tip you dumb shits. crappy service and just alright food, no thanks!"
2902,Glenda S.,1115,1,1/13/18,my friends and i came here. there were three of us in total and we had to wait about minutes for a table for all of us to eat at. everything was good until we saw a small roach crawl across the table. my friends could not eat after seeing that and it ruined my mood. we did not want to waste our money so we asked for a discount and we did not get one.as i looked at the other reviews it looks like this was a problem since .will not be back here.
2903,Jeff E.,1115,1,1/2/18,"be very mindful of how much cash you leave with the waiter. read on. i live in the neighborhood and have had good bowls of ramen here for years. service is becoming increasingly unbearable and far too aggressive. as many other reviewers have mentioned, the service staff is very aggressive when it comes to tips mind you, this place rushes you through your meal and out the door while expecting a minimum % tip . now there is a new trick to get even more out of customers. today, i had a meal and left in cash with the waiter. i very clearly remember that i had only s and one in my wallet. the waiter came back with change as if i would left . i politely told him that i would left him . he raised his voice slightly and said no. you gave me . he ran to his computer, came back, and insisted that i left him . again, looking him straight in the eyes i said, politely but sternly, i left you . he then proceeded to provide the correct change. it goes without saying, but i left very disappointed by this experience. it is not about the money. who cares, it is five bucks, which i left as a tip anyways. it is the dishonesty and the shenanigans they pull off to get more out of their customers. totto's reputation is forever damaged in my eyes. my sense is that the workers here are potentially severely underpaid and need to resort to desperate and dishonest means to pay their bills. if that is true, i'm very sorry they are in that position. i can empathize with that. i cannot empathize with dishonesty as a solution."
2904,Junyuan C.,1115,1,12/26/17,"the waiter will never let you leave even if you have already paid . % for lunch tips cash only and i really did not have an extra cent . if you want to be insulted, welcome to totto ramen!!!"
2905,David W.,1115,1,12/23/17,"we were here to celebrate a friends birthday. they placed our order before we sat as we waited in line. we were seated for only minutes when we finished our food and planned to eat cake. they said it would take too long, despite the fact that other customers were eating for way longer. the workers were extremely rude."
